Voice acting and story line are ON POINT!!!\\n\\nOn release there are 8 dungeons and 2 big boss \"Trials\" as well as 2 lesser Big Boss Trials included with the expansion as well as 5 zones you can obtain flying in right away (Not wait 7 months and have to do a buncha BS, looking @ You WoW)\\n\\nAlso with Shadowbringers it brought a complete revamp to the games combat system and healing system. It made all the jobs (Classes) WAY more fun to play which is awesome. Looking more and more like a fast action MMORPG.\\n\\nEach zone ingame is gorgeous in Shadowbringers, all the music is amazing, the game is more fun to play than ever and jobs are more balanced. What more could you ask for to be honest.\\n\\nSo some people give low scores it seems because it\\'s expensive because they have to buy initial game plus this expansion.

Like it's predecessors, Shadowbringers is truly a game upon itself rather than a simple expansion.A story that deserves to be experienced by all, but unfortunately may only be experienced by few, as it is necessary to work your way through the other fantastic FFXIV expansions before arriving at Shadowbringers.

Nothing else even comes close. The story is brutal, challenging, bold, and almost never \"fun\". It is harrowing, forcing the player to confront violence in a way video games never do. In a medium where everything is John Wick, SHADOWBRINGERS is Schindler\\'s List.\\n\\nAnd just like that film, there were times when I wasn\\'t sure I could keep going. It is a relentless emotional assault that I suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. The game is a work of art - every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. Visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. It is astounding. And frequently beautiful.\\n\\nWith moments you NEVER find in video games.  But I cannot overstate how harrowing it is. It feels like 2 seasons of the darkest TV show you\\'ll ever find, and it frequently better than most TV on the air.  That\\'s saying a lot.  I think it is an IMPORTANT game. It tore me up, and I will never, ever forget SHADOWBRINGERS is a game that will change you.\\n\\nIn short, SHADOWBRINGERS put me through hell.  I did not enjoy it.  I wasn\\'t supposed to.  I was affected by it.  Like no game before.  I am in awe of it.  I am recovering from it.'},\n",

The combat system has been refined and retooled to be more intuitive with less unfun mechanics bogging it down, such as the removal of the ammo and heat systems from Machinist. The story in Shadowbringers is far and away one of the best RPG stories in years and is full of twists and turns that challenge your preconceptions of the rules of the world as well as the morality of your struggle. Masayoshi Soken has also blown us away yet again with his OST, managing to implement all manner of musical genre into an ever-evolving game. Shadowbringers is more than worth your time, and I strongly urge new players to progress through the game normally rather than buy skips to jump straight to the endgame. Endgame isn't everything in XIV and the story loses a lot of meaningful impact by skipping it.\"},\n",

So many plot twist, raw emotions, and just masterful writing in part of the story writers. Tons of voiced cut scenes. You even begin to question yourself if the main villains are actually bad and second guess if what you are doing is even right in the first place. This expansion ties the game into all the expansions before it filling in many of the small questions hinted in the dialog and cut scenes of A Ream Reborn, Heavensward, and Storm Blood.\\n\\nThe sound track for this expansion is stellar, with the exception of the open world battle music in my opinion had to turn that off in the settings. But everything else just fits so well. I found myself literally just listening to the field music in several of the zones and the final battle zone for 30+mins while I did stuff around the house the other day.\\n\\nWorld design they take us to another shard, parallel universe, where the world developed completely differently. You can tell where you are in game but it is done where they really did not borrow any assets from the old Eorzea world. It is masterfully done. Some parts of the world even change as you progress through the story.\\n\\nNegative parts of this expansion are somewhat hard to find, it is very polished but here are a few in my opinion.\\n\\nYou have to do everything else before it or pay to skip to this. So as a new player you have 50ish hours of work to get to this expansion, or drop money in the cashshop. (You will be sorta lost in the story if you do though.)\\n\\nThere are points where you need to level up outside progressing the story. While not bad with what the game give you it sucked to have to take a 1-2hr breaks right as you are getting into the story to continue it. This is standard for a mmo though.\\n\\nThe server issues on certain worlds, while no where near as bad ARR,HW, and Stormblood. Disconnects and ques are up drastically. To note this is common in any major mmo and always resolves itself as the expansion launch gets farther away. This basically means a lot of ppl are playing.\\n\\nExtremely long ques for tanks and dps classes due to shortage of healers. Without the launch of a new healer job this expansion there is an extreme imbalance of jobs in the instance que system. You can expect up to 30min waits as tank and dps. Healers insta get into groups for literally everything.\\n\\nOverall this is one of the single best expansions ever released in any mmo period. I highly suggest purchasing it even if only to play through the story it is that good.\"},\n",

In an attempt to avoid spoilers, I'll not go into detail but the final 'zone' leading up to it's end was incredibly impactful - to feel a sense of nostalgia and sadness bordering on the personal for a place never before visited is uncanny, and it's the truest expression I found to describe 5.0.\\n\\nFor anyone out there thinking of giving it a go, don't hold back.\\n\\nMy opinion is that of one voice among millions, but simply said: Thank you. Thank you, Yoshi-P and the SE team for all the time and effort, the thoughtfulness and the passion you bring to game development and the world of Final Fantasy.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'Having played FFXIV since ver 1.0, I’ve seen the game change and grow over the years.  It’s been a joy too see the game become something that was nothing but a instrument of frustration to the truly great game it is todayVer 1.0 was a mess, and I was ready to abandon this game. Having come from other MMOs I was not impressed to say the least, but when Yoshida came onboard and made his promises to the players, I was doubtful anything would happen, but it did intrigue me.What he did to make good on those promises, and weaving the disaster of the original game into the lore of the Calamity event (fitting name) was masterful. By the end of its lifecycle ver 1.0 was playable and enjoyable a miracle when given what he had to work with.After the servers went down, launching ARR after the long wait was like a breath of fresh air, ARR had pacing issues and such but compared to 1.0, it was amazing, and set the firmament for what was to come. The after story for ARR was painful, you could see Square was struggling with what to do now, since it was apparent pre ARR release they didn’t think the redux was actually going to pay off.  As the months went on I played on, it was like any MMO I understood, Fuller grinds and such.  I wasn’t terribly impressed, but I saw nothing different so played XIV as well as some other MMOs at the time.Heavensward came out and it’s narrative, was amazing.  The atmosphere it set of the world, long standing cultural and literal warfare as the setting was moving. The story was subtle and we were given a deeper understanding of the world we were set in.  The Post HW stories were brief but numerous and kept me involved.The storytelling had come to its own, and I looked forwards to what was to come.  Stormblood came out and the pacing was so different from HW, the story wasn’t as nuanced but showcased a dichotomy where we weren’t focused on one area but two, expanding our view of the world two fold, and showcasing two opposite outcomes of war.  We felt the urgency a bit too much as the pacing had us jumping in and out of two lands but it’s also where the character development started becoming unquestionably refined.  Certain characters become beloved. Certain characters you should feel NO sympathy for, became human.  The worlds NPCs became more than just the 2d characters and villains that serve no purpose than to play their part and fade away from the spotlight.  The after story of SB especially showed that every character you meet probably has a history you may not expect.  And we as the hero are allowed to glimpse that history and understand. Now with Shadowbringers, the storytelling has reached a pinnacle. From the magnificent send off from Stormblood, the last story arc and that final dungeon...  we the players are thrust into a story that draws you in from the opening quest, and subsequent change in venue that quest launches.  We’re presented a slow thought out world, where our conversations feel meaningful and the characters we meet are deeper than just a fetch quest placeholder.  Don’t get me wrong, the quest is probably to fetch something, but you feel there’s a meaning for actually needing it to be done.  Then almost immediately the game sets the stakes high, and inspires the player to want to be a hero.  Want to make things right. Want to figure out a resolution as the problems are encountered.  And these problems?  These problems are set in such a beautiful crafted world, that changes so much as you advance from zone to zone. So very beautiful and complimented by a magnificent musical score. The most consistently great so far.All in all Shadowbringers interweaves all those elements. Characters, environment, music to create a story that makes you want to see how it ends. It rewards you emotionally as well as breaks your heart when appropriate, the world of shadowbringers, has that balance, and makes you want to believe you can make that difference, after all you are the Warrior of Ligh...Darkness...Taken as it is, the story is incomplete if you’re a new player, havingbto work Through all the last content may seem burdensome, but it’s so worth it.  You are the hero here, imagine how many hours of your own lore you’re creating. Not just observing but actually creating a heroic history, with so many moments of pain and triumph that you will feel attached to your character, regardless if you have the best gear or not.  It’s not the destination so much in XIV as the journey, and after Shadowbringers, you’ll want to see more than ever where the journey will go. The creative team shows their love for the game with Shadowbringers and has raised the bar so high, it will be difficult to keep up to par, let alone surpass it.  But I believe Yoshi-P and the team can, and I want to see them succeed. And I intend to be there when they raise that bar higher still.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"This is one of the best Final Fantasy stories in the last two decades and the best I have ever played (I've played VIII, X, XII, XIII). This story alone beats a lot of non-MMO RPGs out there. The voice acting was top-notch and even better than previous expansions. The character development was high quality as well. The cutscenes were well directed as well making the dramatic moments feel much more impact. I couldn't stop taking screenshots of my characters whenever there was a big moment going on in the story. Big credit to the story writers here. The zones were also incredible. Each time I enter a new zone, I was always in disbelief in how much prettier the game and environment got with each new zone. There are definitely times where I stop and took in the sights of the environment. And this without mentioning the music as well. The music that accompanies the zones does a really great job at capturing the mood and atmosphere of the story. Same with the trials as well. The buildup to the 2nd and 3rd fight were great as well making the fights feel much more epic. Credit to Soken for composing an awesome soundtrack.\\n\\nThe only issue I had was the amount of time between the first and second dungeon (but it's understandable as it fits with the story's pacing).

That it's just a checkbox to mark like in Hack&Slashes - where gameplay is all that matters. I was sure the story is a necessary evil to drive the player around to do quests or grind through the content. Years of playing World of Warcraft solidified that opinion for me.\\n\\nNaoki Yoshida (the director of FFXIV) and Natsuko Ishikawa (the writer) have proven me wrong.\\nNot only FFXIV Shadowbringers has undoubtedly the best story ever written in an MMORPG, even better than universally praised Heavensward expansion from the same game, but also one of the best stories I have seen in any RPG I've played for the last decade at least. Not often do I have goosebumps during a cutscene in a video game, but Shadowbringers is just so good I'm not ashamed of admitting it.\\nThe music is also on the next level. Masayoshi Soken has again proven his mettle - he makes the highest grade video game music, on equal footing with Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Cross) and Nobuo Uematsu (FF series). It suplements the story of FFXIV in a way that when combined it truly deserves the unofficial title of KINObringers.\\n\\nThe gameplay and graphics suffer a little bit in Final Fantasy, having to accommodate for console players. They're not bad, mind you - they just aren't at their full potential due to the PS3/PS4 limitations. But if I have to judge the expansion on its own it's still a perfect 10 for me. Worth every penny spent.\\n\\nIt's made with love and care, which is especially impressive if you account that (allegedly) the game is made on a shoestring budget.

       "  'review': \"This Expansion is beyond fantastic!\\nFirst of all, let's look at the bad parts, to show how few there are:\\n- The combat music for overworld battles is horrible\\n- The FPS cap was a mistake (although it's being removed again)\\n- Many large areas look pretty empty\\n- From all the shiny old weapons they only implemented the Omega weapons for Gunbreaker and Dancer, unlike Stormblood, where they implemented almost all old weapons for Redmage and Samurai\\n\\nAnd that's it! Everything else is absolutely wonderful:\\n- The music is wonderful through the bank. Every dungeon theme is on spot and fits the theme. Every boss theme is incredibly exciting. Every zone theme is absolutely perfect and when the area's night is restored the music gets even better. And the Final battle's music is unbelievable\\n- The story of this expansion is absolutely breathtaking, especially the ending. You thought Avengers: Endgame was a great ending? It is total crap compared to Shadowbringers's ending. Shadowbringers genuinely made me cry for the bad guy in the end, despite having done the good deed. Never had this experience before\\n- The lore is so rich and well implemented, that you crave for more and actually want to listen to non-essential NPC conversations, which I never did before\\n- The changes to combat classes, despite them being a simplification of their rotations, feels extremely good, satisfying and rewarding now. Jobs feel much more intuitive and mistakes don't punish you in such an unsatisfying way anymore (also, boss transitions aren't such a pain anymore)\\n- The endgame is full of interesting stuff to do, like the Crystarium deliveries, FATE chains that reward you with several different things (apparently they've learned from Eureka), the typical expert dungeons (which also are very entertaining), very interesting extreme boss fights, countless Sightseeing Log spots that are a challenge to reach, level scaling Sidequests that now reward you with decent experience no matter when you take it and a soon to be released raid which I can't wait to see\\n- The trust system (running dungeons with 3 story NPCs instead of 3 other players) is actually better than I imagined it would be. They perform flawlessly in every dungeon, which is great for players who still have difficulties learning the mechanics - even if you deliberately pull extra mobs (the NPCs can take it) - with the only downside vs real human players being that trust NPCs do much less damage and the dungeon takes longer to complete in general\\n- The new races Viera and Hrothgar - despite only existing as one gender each in the game for now - look absolutely stunning and despite thinking that not many players would pick up the bulky, muscular Hrothgar, I've actually seen lots and lots of them running around\\n- The two new jobs Dancer and Gunbreaker feel extremely great to play. Their animations and sound effects are super satisfying and their general gameplay feels extremely polished\\n- With the active subscriber count reaching over the 1 million players bar the game feels so full of other players and no matter where you go at any time everything feels so full\\n\\nAll in all, this is the best Final Fantasy XIV expansion so far - even a lot greater than Heavensward, which was already amazing and of course better than Stormblood, which was not that great in comparison, but still good.\"},\n",

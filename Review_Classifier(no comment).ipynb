       " \"Hands down, one of the best games on DS. Ghost Trick is completely brilliant from start to finish- with great puzzles, fantastic characters, an engaging story and a truly awesome ending. Each character is fully realised, and everyone has a part to play in this stellar tale. The puzzles can be a bit hit and miss occassionally, but you'll forgive it, if only because it's so utterly likeable.\",\n",
       " 'Innovative and addictive style of gameplay, engaging story rich in creativity without being cliche,  catchy music that fits the situation in the game, and a cast of unforgettable characters and their eccentric personalities. Ghost Trick is truly a heartfelt and magical experience that proves how amazing a handheld video game can make someone feel and shows that the Nintendo DS is still a worthy console.',\n",
       " 'Phenomenal. This game is the perfect blend of puzzle solving, mystery, and creative gameplay. The characters are charming, the story is captivating, and the puzzles are generally well done, with only a few strange ones here and there. If you love a good mystery game this is something you must play!',\n",
       " \"I picked up this game expecting good things from the people who brought us Phoenix Wright, but Ghost Trick has exceeded my every expectation. The gameplay is so innovative, yet at the heart of this game is some truly fanciful storytelling. Contrast this with the Professor Layton series, which for all the praise it gets, does not make any attempt to integrate the puzzles into the actual story. With Ghost Trick, the puzzling is so seamlessly interwoven that you really feel you have a direct hand in the characters' actions. The character design is like a super stylized comic book, and the character movements are so graceful that I have to believe that animators, not programmers, designed the sequences. I hope that Ghost Trick becomes a series on the new 3DS platform, as there are a lot of possibilities when you factor dimensionality. But even if it doesn't, Ghost Trick stands on its own as a very complete, deeply enjoyable piece of art.\",\n",

       " \"Sadly, I didn't enjoy this game, mostly for reasons that probably only apply to me. Although I'm a massive fan of the Phoenix Wright games, Ghost Trick, even with its similarities to the Ace Attorney trilogy, failed to impress me.\\nThe game looks good; it's stylized and colorful, but the soundtrack didn't quite click with me. I also didn't really enjoy the gameplay; I solved the earlier puzzles with ease or by trial and error that immediately paid off, but a later puzzle had me absolutely stumped and brought my playthrough to a screeching halt. I'm sorry, but I didn't even like the puzzle-solving itself simply because it didn't feel satisfying enough for the most part.\\nThe thing that annoys me the most about this title is its odd sense of humor. A character getting killed by ending up squashed underneath of a giant roast chicken struck me as embarrassingly bizarre, and I found many of the characters to be off-putting as well. I'm fully aware that this is just a personal issue and that many people will enjoy Ghost Trick's style of humor and mystifying plot, but I'm afraid I simply didn't.\\nI'm sorry! I want to like Ghost Trick.  Ghost Trick fans, please don't take this as an insult; this is simply my unfortunate opinion.\",\n",

Sure, usually the same method of ghost and tricking works for most puzzles,ï»¿ but that's not the point. It's a genuinely fun game to play. It is a one-shot wonder however, once you complete it chances are you won't want to return to it.\",\n",

The plot is great, the humor is exactly what you might expect from the creators of Phoenix Wright, and it's all held up by a fantastic cast of characters. It's not an exaggeration to say this is one of the best, if not the best game on the DS.\",\n",

       " 'How was this shit in the ranking?The Witcher documents the last Sigu from Ahuya',\n",
       " \"Shu Takumi might have topped Phoenix Wright. The writing is sheer perfection, seemingly simple at first until it starts revealing the tricks up its sleeve.  The gameplay is quite clever and adds more elements both without ever running out of ideas before introducing them and building the story tremendously. The last several hours feature so many twists that the story and puzzles mesh, putting emotion into rotating a piston or opening a trashcan so that you aren't merely completing a level but saving the lives of characters you actually care about.The only possible way for Takumi to improve the experiences he's created is to somehow expand the gameplay elements while keeping the size and sweep of the story intact. Until then, the next iterations of Ace Attorney and Ghost Trick will be warmly welcomed.\",\n",
       " \"This game is brilliant, very pretty and I must mention that the Animation is almost perfect. It makes the characters very charismatic and the story even more believable.  The design is well done and there is a good balance of difficulty. With many puzzles they throw at you small hints, not obvious enough to spoil the fun and obvious enough to push your thinking-machine. The humor also surprised me in this game, it made me smile and giggle a lot. I recommend this game to anyone who like puzzle games and/or liked the Phoenix Wright serie. Yes it's a 10 point, 9 wouldn't be enough. Enjoy!\",\n",
       " \"One of the best games on the DS. IGN summed it up perfectly by saying that Ghost Trick brings innovation to an ageing genre. The game draws your total attention for the full 12 hours of game play. I was fixated for the duration and near tears come the end.

When you are dead you discover that you have special powers. You can possess items and trick them, causing the item to do a action. It may sound strange, but it is very easy to use and feels very fresh. You then find out that you cant remember anything about who you were and why you were killed, and that you only have till sunrise before you go to the afterlife. Sissel decides that he is going to use his last hours on earth wisely and try and find out his identity. Its a great story and it gets better and better as you progress. Another brilliant thing about this game is the spectacular graphics. It is very detailed and when people and items move it looks amazing and is very smooth.

I would estimate there are about two 10 second segments that offer any challenge at all for a person of average intelligence.\\n\\nThe animation is excellent and story has great potential that sadly gets wasted in the second half of the game.

Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.\\n\\nThe review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.\\n\\nThe scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.\\n\\nNotice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section\\n\\nThe final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review.

If the ending was good the game would\\'ve been at least an 8 in my books.\\n\\n[Spoiler Alert]\\n\\nSo, about the ending. It\\'s revealed that you\\'re a cat at the end. The problem with this is they never properly set it up. This ending would have been fine, if they made it legitimate throughout the course of the game. But they didn\\'t. They gave very few clues about your identity, and at times the clues were contradicted, so that made it confusing.\\n\\nThey did this whole nonsense about you not having memory of who you were because your body was obscured, and that you are a cat. But this does not fall in line with what they established about animals. The dog Missile had the personality of a dog, and he could remember himself for the most part. So, they gave us observations about animals, but did not follow it for your character the cat. They made double standards.\\n\\nSo, you\\'re a cat, but you act 100% like a human? Not like an animal? They threw you off from figuring it out on your own. They never gave any good hints. Just small things here, and there that weren\\'re really substantive.\\n\\nIf they wanted to fix this they should have shown the cat more, first of all, and made your character behave more like a cat. They could\\'ve done this in numerous ways. Let\\'s say that scene where Sissel goes to the chicken restaurant. Maybe he\\'d say he doesn\\'t like chicken as much as fish. Or make Sissel have a good sense of smell, and only he could see in the night, but no one else can.\\n\\nPerhaps be a little cheeky, and he says, \"Oh, how did I survive? It\\'s like I have 9 lives.\" Things like that. Just make it obvious but not too obvious. When the ending is revealed the player should say, \"Of course!\" Instead of \"wtf?\"\\n\\nYou know, they just didn\\'t use the stereotypes of cats to the benefit of the player. Why not make Missile a little more hostile to Sissel? Because you know they say cats, and dogs don\\'t get along. How about Sissel taking the form of the man in red, and poking fun at his appearance going, \"Hmm, so this is how I look? I thought I\\'d be more handsome.\"\\n\\nEtc.

Such a story based game may put a few people off, but it IS a good one.\\n\\nGameplay is much like Phoenix Wright, as in you solve simple puzzles.  Much like said game, there is  usually only one solution, so you repeat until that has been solved.  Puzzles are solved by \"possessing\" things, but your power is not strong, so you can mostly just slightly move things.  Another character you come across can \"swap\" objects around with the same shape.\\n\\nThe game plays more like an interactive story book, so if mad action is what you\\'re searching for, you won\\'t find it.  Zip.\\nYou could finish it very quickly if you skipped story and knew all the puzzles, but it took me around 25-30 hours to complete.\\n\\nWhere the game EXCELS in is its story.  You follow a spirit trying to regain its memory, but you only have until midnight- or you die!  Following the story, you develop an attachment to the other characters, who are all incredibly well thought out.  Each has their own style, noone is generic.\\n\\nGraphics are also beautiful.  So pleasurable to the eye.  The way that the cop in white dances around whilst walking.  Animation and graphics style works so well on a system as old as the NDS.\\n\\nLets put all the people who like action movies like \"Terminator 4\", or \"AVP\" onto one side,  then put something like \"Bladerunner\" on the other.\\nThem who like story driven narrative (Bladerunner) will love this.',\n",

It\\'s a nice touch when EVERYTHING they present to you becomes important later on. I\\'m looking at you, [spoiler]    and [spoiler]    . The ending didn\\'t tie up every loose end, but it\\'s more than satisfactory regardless. Although there\\'s not really a reason to play it again, as there is only one linear story-arc, it\\'s worth at least a rent to play through it once. You shouldn\\'t regret it.',\n",

After death he recieved powers to posess and manipulate objects, and travel back in time to before a death. The puzzles in this game consist of saving a character before they're murdered or die by moving around objects to change the situation. The graphics are unique and the character animations are really fluent. The characters in this game are all full of life and the story is one of the most engaging things on the DS. My only gripes with this game would have to be the inconsistant difficulty (the final puzzle is very easy to solve yet ones earlier on in the game are brain scratchers) and that the story takes a short while to get going. But once it did, I literally couldn't put the game down to find out what happened next. This is essential to Phoenix Wright fans and gamers alike and if you haven't bought it yet, why?\",\n",

Animation-wise it is simply splendid, the pixel graphics are gorgeous and the music incredibly fitting. The game also makes great use of chromostereopsis, especially in the ghost world, to give a sense of depth that those who perceive the effect to a great extent (like myself) will double their enjoyment of the title. Gameplay stays fresh and satisfying for the whole duration. If I had to find a defect, if we want to call it so, it's its strict linearity; you are rarely given an opportunity to explore and look for clues on yourself, instead the characters themselves give so many hints you will want to cover your eyes to leave the surprise unspoiled.

Absolutely creepy and haunting, it’s a great “play in the dark with the headphones on” sort of experience that’s perfect for this time of year and the game does a great job of letting you periodically see things in the periphery that’ll catch your attention. Now, when it comes to play, I’ll admit it’s a bit of an oddball as for once handheld play is likely the ideal way to go. Combat will have you trying to keep your enemies in frame to defeat them, and this is far more easily accomplished being able to tilt your Switch in-hand (which makes sense since this comes from the WiiU) so you can freely tilt it as quickly or slowly as you like as opposed to trying to do it with the digital shoulder buttons playing in docked mode. I can’t speak to how it compares to its brethren but if you’re going into this weekend wanting to be creeped out (though not necessarily scared) this will do a great job of putting you in that mood.\\n\\nhttps://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/10/mini-reviews-october-29th-edition.html',\n",

Hades spices up that game loop by surprising you at every step with an incredible amount of quality content, that lasts well beyond the final credits.\\n\\n- FANTASTIC SCREENPLAY AND ACTING: At their worst, the writing and acting in Hades are Hollywood quality. At their best, they put most movies to shame.\\n\\n- SOUND MECHANICS: All the carefully curated content and the top-class dramatic work are nice–but at the bottom of it, Hades is still an action game, and a very good one at that. You\\'ll be suitably amused and frustrated while learning to escape the underworld.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nSOME REPETITION: No matter how good, Hades is still a roguelike. You do the same thing over and over. This game does a great job of throwing new unexpected things at you, but a feeling of repetition still sets in after a while.\\n\\nUNBALANCED WEAPONS AND BOONS: Hades is carefully curated and balanced–but even then, some weapons are so much better than others, that the game has a hard time convincing you to vary your build, no matter how hard it tries. After the first successful run, you\\'ll know exactly what you need to \"win\" multiple times in a row.',\n",

       " \"The roguelike that made me enjoy a roguelike. Hades has fantastic and fun gameplay (and an easy mode for those of us who don't have the time or dedication to get gud) but where I was really hooked was the story, astounding voice acting, beautiful art and killer soundtrack.\\n\\nWhile it got old going through the same areas again and again (three area types doesnt make for a varied palate, no matter how much they're randomly generated) I still had a blast playing this game for WAY too long.\",\n",

       " \"I really don't know why every1 thinks that game is good. It is repetitive, annoying, the evolution is boring and we waste a lot of time coming and going in Hades house. If the story is good ( it doesn't look to be) I don't know when it starts to be good. Even after killing the first bosses, nothing really interesting happens. Total waste of time. Is that a some kind of difficult isometric game for Nintendo's children or for millennials? I am not impressed at all.\",\n",

       " \"Great game: stunning art, compelling and responsive combat system, incredible dialouges and voice actors. The whole game oozes care and attention, definitely Supergiant's masterpiece.\\nThe only thing that keeps the game away from a perfect score is that it needed more variation: while the Pact of Punishment puts a little patch on this issue, it is definitely not enough. Number of power-ups and weapons is fine, but with only 4 dungeons (and bosses) you only crave for more.\",\n",
       " 'A masterpiece the best rogue like I ever played (I played a lot of rogue likes the binding of isaac, dont starve, spelunky 2, dead cells and enter the gungeon) but hades is the best one the combat feels so good the characters are realy great and its realy addicting',\n",
       " \"Hades is a true masterpiece. I haven't seen a game with so much love and passion since.... Forever. Even some of the best games I played such as Doom 2016, BOTW, Mario galaxy, etc. There are times where I can feel some lack of imagination(Odyssey), or something that was left incomplete because the devs didn't have time(Doom 2016 multiplayer) or some issue with story(BOTW). When it comes to Hades, there is nothing at all to keep it from receiving a perfect score. There are a few small nitpicks. After each death you can interact with an NPC once normally and this can be odd when you want to continue their side story but can't, and sometimes some of the god boons feel a bit unbalanced, with some of them pretty much being objectively better than others, but this is all small potatoes. Hades takes the idea of dying in a game and rather than making it a simple penalty where you respawn at a checkpoint which even the best videogames do, and instead it makes death progression. It makes you feel satisfied with dying because that means going back to Hades and talking to the amazing characters. That's another thing. The characters are all charming, with different personalities, and you interact with them in so many ways, and all the small comments and other small things in talking really makes everything feel more connected. This is an absolute must.There are other things like the music, combat, often quick load times, pretty smooth performance, and many more things, but I think the point is made. If you have not played this game get it.Personally I think hades being a contender for GOTY says more about AAA studios than the game. It shows that AAA like Activision, Ubisoft, and even Nintendo really need to step up their game. Supergiant worked so hard on making this game, and you can tell how much heart and love they poured into it. In the future, I'm gonna keep my eye on more indie games. I'm tired of so many games that cost 3x more than Hades make something unoriginal or boring. Hades is the golden standard of what videogames can truly be about. Play it.\",\n",
       " 'Let me first say, I\\'m really not a huge fan of roguelikes, Too often I find them repetitive, boring, and often frustrating. Hades is repetitive and sometimes frustrating, but fair and never, ever boring. It has a great learning curve that is challenging and rewarding; yes, it is difficult, but with practice you\\'ll find yourself getting further and further each time. Death is not a big deal in the Underworld, so when you die, it\\'s merely a chance to talk to everyone and advance their stories before heading back out for another run.\\n\\nThe gameplay is addictive. Every time I die, I can\\'t help but feel that tug of \"just one more run\" because it\\'s such a joy to play. It\\'s incredibly responsive and never feels cheap. If you die, it\\'s because you were bested by an enemy you need more practice against, not because of some flawed game mechanic. There are many different weapons to choose from, and with each weapon able to take on several different forms, there are a lot of ways to play and styles to master. Because of this, the replayability factor is very high, especially considering the end-game ability to enable certain options that can make the game much, much harder. If you\\'re like me and, through many deaths and dozens of hours of play, suddenly found yourself able to practically waltz out of the Underworld unscathed, turning on enough of these challenges will make sure you find yourself again struggling to best the first boss.\\n\\nThe story keeps you coming back for more, too. Without spoiling anything, suffice to say there is ample reason to continue playing after you have \"beaten\" the game, because there\\'s still so much more story waiting to happen. Artwork, music, and voice acting are all top-notch and as good as any game I\\'ve played. It\\'s one of those games where you can listen to the soundtrack on Spotify and thoroughly enjoy it on its own.\\n\\nIn my opinion, it\\'s the best action game I believe I\\'ve ever played. At nearly 60 hours of game time, I\\'m still finding myself enjoying each and every run with Zagreus trying to escape the Underworld.',\n",

One of the saving graces of this year.',\n",

I'm a sloppy player, I've finished the game for ONLY the first time only after dying a couple dozens of times... And you need much more to see real ending. But because this game's plot and story is a masterpiece, dying wasn't something frustrating. Arguably the best rougelike ever, beating even fabulous Dead cells, that gives us virtually no story at all. Characters, music, art - all this emphasize the story and setting. Just few faults: Switch performance is sometimes, just sometimes, a bit sloppy as I am while text in descriptions is way too small even on TV. And we want more levels and are ready to pay for them, Supergiant!\",\n",

       " \"At face value, this game can be quite frustrating. The seemingly endless deaths after relatively short escape attempts bely the cleverness of this game. And because of this, many may well give up early and decry this game as rubbish. But it's not. Here's a hint. Every time you restart, talk to the NPCs. They all have tips & tricks to share to help guide you. In doing so, you will soon learn that this isn't a pointless game. Each run means you're getting stronger. And as you get stronger, you learn more about this world, reach furher into the world and discover more about the all the wonderful characters and stories. Playing and controls are relatively easy to learn and perfect and the nature of starting an escape attempt and pushing as far as you can until you die, makes it easier to pick up and put down this game. So if you're after bite sized gaming. This game will work for you. In so saying, as you progress it becomes more and more addictive. So don't be surprised if you lose hours in it at a time.\",\n",

When a game like Hades comes around and starts getting recommended everywhere, you sorta have to dive in and see what it's all about. Supergiant Games is a company that I was aware of, but I'd never tried any of their games, despite many people recommending games like Bastion and Transistor to me over the years.\\n\\nWhen you're just starting to play the game, Hades feels like a lot of fun. Characters feel interesting, combat is fast and engaging, and everything feels really good quality. Unfortunately, this is one of those games that doesn't succeed on being a roguelite; Hades gets very repetitive very fast, and everything goes from being enjoyable to being tedious. It's two hours of a good game, and the rest is a chore.\\n\\nPerhaps if Hades had made the decision to not use the randomised nature of a roguelite, it could have been an exceptional game for me.

But that doesn't mean this game is easy. It remains a big challenge but it does a wonderful job of guiding you toward improving yourself.\\nAdd in a healthy variety of weapons (most unlockable) for different kinds of gameplay, good graphics that are bound to stand the test of time, an awesome rocking soundtrack and outstanding (and sexy) voice-acting and you got yourself an excellent videogame that you'll be playing for a long, long time.

As a result, it\\'s not frustrating. It\\'s just fun all the time.\\n\\nInterestingly, I find Hades similar to Civilization, of all games. It has that same \"one more turn\" feel to it. You could easily burn away all the hours of the night just having \"one more\" go, and have a blast doing it.\\n\\nAs other have said, the visuals, story, sound design, and gameplay are all masterful. But I want to emphasize the value here. There\\'re 6 basic weapons and each has 4 variants, so there\\'s 24 different combat styles. And that\\'s without even mentioning all the perks you get from the Olympian gods as they aid your escape from the underworld, or the \"keepsakes\" - items gifted to you by other characters which you carry with you to provide various benefits. With those included, there must be millions of different combinations of abilities, and millions of styles of play. I mean, the depth and value here is off the charts.\\n\\nThis is one of those games like the Witcher 3 where I actually feel kind of guilty for buying it on sale, because I know it deserves the full price.

All the characters' dialogues and small interactions are priceless.\\n\\nThis game is not only for those who love addictive and punishing roguelike games but is also a must-play for everyone who loves ancient Greece and its mythology since the story is so well-written and interesting.

The biggest problem with this game is its fundamental design of repeating levels, dying, becoming slightly stronger than last time, and hoping the RNG system will give you the abilities needed to beat the game, because you cannot beat this game with any build or any weapon, it really is so narrowed down to a singular play style that attempting to learn new weapons/fighting styles and honing your mechanics is like a said, a gigantic waste of time. The game gives you barely any chances to heal, yet the gameplay and enemies damaging abilities are so unforgiving that you absolutely NEED a reliable healing mechanic in this game. It’s ironic, because it gets harder and harder the farther you reach, yet you find yourself losing more and more precious health that you need in order to keep going further. It’s just one gigantic frustrating loop that at its core, is more tedious and time consuming than trying to learn how to knit with one hand. The one and only redeeming quality about this game is the dialogue, which was actually hilarious and really well done. Do yourself a favor and skip this game.

But what is the point of an easy mode if you negate it by making it harder as the damage resistance increases? I've tried Bastion, Transistor, and Hades and I don't recommend any of them. They all have good elements but fatal flaws that ruin the fun. Go play Don't Starve, Stardew Valley instead, and Mark of the Ninja instead, those are truly good games.\",\n",

Good, enjoy the review, not clouded the majority hivemind.\\n\\nI like to start my reviews with the things I enjoyed. Generally, that IS the most highlight but then base everything on—superficial things took way beyond what really matters while ignoring all the glaring problems underneath.\\n\\nPositives:\\n\\nMusic- Really well crafted. Orchestrated tunes, as well as the pieces with lyrics, are all great. I found myself sitting around Eurydice sing plenty of times. Some of the pieces set up a boss fight, awesome, and gets your blood pumping (The first few times). It wears off after you hear the same thing 10 times.\\n\\nVoice acting: Good, Eurdiyce in particular, as well as Thanatos and Achillies.Quirky dialogue is really great in many exchanges; Thesus and Zag got a laugh out of me a couple of times. Zag\\'s responses with Tisiphone got me to laugh as well.\\n\\nSide Stories: Fun, though, while I enjoyed unlocking parts, not a single one convinced me to finish them after getting the true ending.\\n\\nCombat: It\\'s a roguelike. It\\'s quite fun for the first hour or two.\\n\\n___________________________________________\\n\\nNegatives:\\nCombat: It\\'s a roguelike; it\\'s quite fun for the first hour or two. Weapons are both fun and excruciatingly bad. This isometric, procedurally generated dungeon scroller and some weapons are crafted to not work on this plane. The sword is a 4-way weapon on a platform that is anything but. The bow might be the stupidest weapon in the game to work with by far as a base weapon. In a game that demands you zip around enemies like a madperson, having to charge your basic attack makes it unfun.\\n\\nMain Story: The first time I cleared the game, and I learned where it was going, I went \"OH! Intrigue\" by the 10th time? There was no intrigue to any of the threads that the narrative eluded to. If there are and they are in the side missions, the game doesn\\'t sell itself well to do the same thing over and over and over again to get the complete explanation(s). I completed the entire main story in 38 runs; if you can\\'t settle the entire thing by then, you failed.\\n\\nVoice Acting: Sure, it\\'s well-acted, but the delivery by the actors wasn\\'t great. I get someone like Zagreus is supposed to be a moody angst-ridden character. But places where he needed to emote, he didn\\'t, and it happened a lot. Some of the Gods are either Hammy or way overplayed. Megaera was possibly one of the worst offenders here by her willowy delivery that grated on my nerves every time I had to talk to her.\\n\\nItems/costs: Inflated costs that beg you to play this thing forever. It\\'s not worth dumping hundreds of hours. Again, the combat is fun, but that lasts for like two hours, at most. After you hit a threshold with weapon upgrades and shadow, plus figuring out to beef up your HP as fast as you can in the run, you end up in this droll, boring slog of doing the same thing over and over because deviating from it doesn\\'t freshen up the game; it\\'s purposely choosing the least efficient path to break up the monotony.  Force concentration, you\\'re doing this in this game, or you\\'re not playing it right.\\n\\nThen there is the expansion of both the House of Hades and the material costs to build relationships. The tiny amount of gems and diamonds to unlock much of the house put way too much emphasis on the currency and not the thing you bought. Using the hard-earned currency made the thing you spent it on underwhelming. It\\'s almost like the game mocking you for working hard for a cosmetic item that does nothing.\\n\\nEarning Nectar feels the same way, but worse in some cases, but there are just so many characters you have to both give it to AND how many you have to give to each, and if you\\'re lucky; you might 3 in a run, sometimes you\\'ll get none. No thanks, I\\'m good; I don\\'t want to keep doing the same thing and over again for a dribble of content.\\n\\nHarder Difficulties: You can paint a turd up; however, you want; it\\'s still a turd. Pickable hindrances to make things \"More challenging\" is lazy. If you really wanted to give players added challenges, you should have just had more games across the board.\\n\\nConclusion: Hades is a fun game that caps out at being fun around 10 hours, at most. Once you complete the main story, nothing else really has enough weight in my opinion to go on. If you enjoy the monotony of endlessly doing the same content again and again, the game provides it, but not for anyone else. Put down the controller and move onto something new.… Expand',\n",

       " \"This game is very challenging. The graphics are great, the music is good, and the performance is phenomenal. The downsides are the severe limitations that it puts on you and its storytelling.\\n\\nYou're basically always low on health, armor and ammo. You need to burn, blast, shoot and carve your way through a seemingly endless onslaught of enemies that feel as though they're a little too accurate. The combat can be very frustrating, but when you finally get through the challenge, you feel so good about the victory that the frustration gets pushed away. This game is NOT Doom 2016. Expect things to be Doom 2016's endgame difficulty at the start and it only goes up from there. It's very give and take and die until you win. The enemies have unique mechanics that (once you learn them) will make your life a lot easier. Once you get used to the resource management, enemy mechanics and using all of your mobility options all the time, the game really is like having hell on Earth.\\n\\nThe storytelling doesn't have the same presence as in Doom 2016, or its predecessor, Doom 3. I think the narrative should have more presence, but let's face the truth. This is Doom. It throws you into the action and story is there as a side note. For those that are wondering why is Vega with you in your suit and your base? That answer is simple. In Doom 2016 when you destroyed Vega, you made a copy of him and put him in your suit. How did you get off mars? You're the friggin' Doomguy. You're a walker of Armageddon. You're able to go between Hell and Earth freely. The loopholes aren't really loopholes as much as they're people not paying attention. If you want the story, pay attention to the narrative, what Doomguy does and the codex. Playing Doom 2016 will help with knowing his backstory. Doom 2016 was a retelling of Doom 1993, Doom Eternal is a retelling of Doom 2.\\n\\nOverall, the game is amazing. Pay attention to everything and don't expect anything to handed to you. The game is an astounding take on Armageddon. I'm looking forward to what they do next.\",\n",

Again, in the role of the executioner of the rock, we steal the hordes of demons in minced meat and other meat delicacies. Now the main place of events is the Earth, which was filled with Satanic abstracts in order to destroy the root of the human race to obtain their souls, from which Argent-Energy is produced, because this is so commanded by the ancient Order of the Night Guardians and Kan Creator. The earth is of course the main place of the battle, but far from the only thing where the plot will throw us.

I think Doom: Eternal looks really cool. Sufficiently varied and also very large areas really invite you to marvel. The brutality, the aesthetics, the architectural design of the levels was terrific (I thought Urdak, for example, was really awesome).\\n\\nThe performance on the Series X is almost perfect. The game ran 99% of the time, despite the very high dynamics, the many different effects, colors, etc. without any problems. Strangely enough, when I tried to pull myself up on an edge, I often had short frame breaks.\\n\\nAlso in the last level I had a flickering edge from hell, a restart fixed it right away.\\n\\nThe appearance of the opponents and weapons fits perfectly into the game and is partly known from the predecessor.\\n\\nThe music does the rest and always makes you want to go to the next round of combat in the area.\\n\\nThere are also humorous passages, such as the Doom Guy deals with a scientist. It\\'s funny.\\n\\nGameplay\\n\\nIt is the centerpiece and really tears in. The combined gameplay of Glory-Kill = health or bloodbeat, chainsaw = ammunition and flamethrower = armor enables a dynamic in the game that can lead to a real flow of bloodlust. It took me some time to get in at the beginning, but once you understand it, it just goes off.\\n\\nYou really notice how you improve with several hours of play and get into this \"flow\" more and more often.\\n\\nIn addition, there are the outstanding weapons, all of which I enjoyed except for the rocket launcher. I\\'ve used every weapon over and over and the super shotgun with fire chain is one of my favorites. With the rocket launcher, I always had the problem that the dynamics became too fast for me and I very often killed myself. But later on I also found my use for the part here.\\n\\nThere are also countless upgrade options for weapons and armor, as well as certain runes that make the game easier, because it has been a tough challenge. E.g. Funnily enough, I really liked the sniper upgrade for the heavy weapon, as it is a great feeling to target the weak points of larger opponents in the middle of the dynamic.\\n\\nThere is so much to discover, the game rewards you with secrets, some of which can be exhibited in the HUB. I also find the HUB very nice and I have always looked around there and e.g. listened to the records.\\n\\nSo all gold that glitters? Not quite.\\n\\nThe puzzles (as a \"decelerating\" element, which I found okay in and of itself) were extremely easy and very lame, and the jump passages weren\\'t really my thing either. I also found these rather boring and would have liked to have had more demanding passages.\\n\\nAnd as with Doom 2016, I would have liked to have had more bosses. So I mean real boss opponents who don\\'t appear later as easy opponents. Doom is actually ideal for horny boss counters.\\n\\nSpeaking of opponents: The Marauder is the biggest crap I\\'ve seen in the shooter genre. I didn\\'t enjoy the guy at all and even took it away from me. Later you get littered with the enemy and it\\'s just annoying, especially his messed up dog. Even when I found out how to fight him, it didn\\'t change anything about the fact that it wasn\\'t fun.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe best shooter I\\'ve played in a long time.

The game takes everything that worked from 2016, made it better, throws away everything that doesn't work, and adds new stuff that makes the game so much better, Eternal is one of the most fun games that has ever been made, the gameplay is so smooth and flawless, the gore and action is unlimited and I always crave more everytime I play, and the soundtrack, OMG This soundtrack, I can't explain how many hours I've spent in the main menu listening to it's theme and going on YouTube listening for countless hours on every theme in the game, the enemy variants are unique along with the fact that every weapon has it's purpose and strategy instead of you just using one weapon (probably the super shotgun) non-stop the whole game, Eternal has made it so each weapon serves a role in the game, my only bicker is that the story isn't all that but you could choose to ignore it and the game won't get any less fun, overall Doom Eternal is a must play for anyone who is a fast action paced fps shooter fan and a Doom fan, please play this game you won't regret it, easy 10/10 and my personal game of the year.\",\n",

       " \"I made an account to leave this review. DOOM Eternal is one of the best games I have played in the last 5 years. ID has managed to innovate and create something original, new, fresh. The first person shooter feeling becomes very strategic in how you kill your opponents. You need to manage your health, armor and ammo to stay alive. Sometimes that means killing your enemies in specific ways. Reinventing the run and gun campaign. You won't mindlessly shoot AI enemies, you will be forced to think fast or... die. A The campaign was very fun, challenging and something I'll be playing again.....but the Marauder can be deleted from the games code. I mean that. It's a terrible enemy especially for this game. It is the only enemy that slows game play down to a crawl. And you do one mechanic against him; wait, get shot at see green eyes and shoot with a shotgun. Only a shotgun, any other gun is useless against him as far as I'm concerned. Delete that awful enemy, the fighting mechanic you make us do against him is not fun! Lastly I'd say that there is a lack of freedom in the game with the ammo, armor and health system. An alternative would have been nice, like a classic mode or something. DOOM fan boys will show their disgust with the system by rating 0's and leaving long ranted posts about how much they hate everything, don't listen to them ID Software! Great game! 10/10 amazingly fun campaign!\",\n",

Although all these three works turned out to be worthy, you understand purely at an emotional level that it carries a dough from them, but it doesn’t get better from that. The sensation of the “Kinder Surprise” disappeared, as is often the case with sequels, where the emphasis is on more, cooler, more solid, and the soul does not fall into the background, but still pushed aside. At the same time, the creators from the first minutes, as if \"accidentally\", say: you knew what you were going on, no warming up, immediately jump into the bake of the comrades.

It'll take a lot of work to learn how to utilize speed and verticality to your advantage. They redesigned all the enemies and weapons, which makes everything fresh. They also added a lot of new weapons, and enemies. You also have a hub area, unlike the previous game. I didn't really think this was needed that much, but it's something interesting to explore. The game is gorgeous, with amazing art direction. The soundtrack is god tier, making you truly feel like the Slayer. Most of the missions are pretty good, the stories good, and the lore is all good. However, the game is brought down to a 9 for me because of the seemingly low amount of missions, that it seems like there isn't much of a need for a mission select button. There also isn't much of a reason to replay levels, unless playing on higher difficulties. This is in thanks to a fast travel feature, unlocked near the end of the level, which allows you to fast travel to points across the map. This allows you to quickly collect collectibles and complete optional encounters. Overall though, its a fantastic game.\",\n",

The gameplay feels fast and responsive. Kept me engaged from start to finish. It is a game where you think about what you are doing unlike with DOOM 2016 where you just point and shoot. You have to constantly be aware of you ammo supply and HP. Going in for glory kills and chainsawing demons looks and feels amazing. DOOM 2016 looked great and still does but man oh man does Eternal look fantastic. From graphics to sound design, this game excels in every way. This is a game you can master and feel like a true DOOM Guy. Buy this and RIP AND TEAR.\",\n",
       " \"DOOM: Eternal is, in my opinion, the greatest FPS ever made. It perfected the push-forward styled combat from 2016 and has pushed the DOOM franchise incredibly far. The combat loop is very satisfying, getting you to constantly scan your environment for ways to continue fighting (fodder demons to chainsaw/flame belch, monkey bars to dodge foes, important demons to focus on and fodder location, etc.) and is very rewarding. The game isn't afraid to kick your ass, which is appreciated from 2016 which was pretty easy, even in the late game. While the restricted ammo may come across as an annoyance, it helps reinforce the combat loop and gets your brain to constantly scan the environment for ammo pickups/fodder and to monitor your ammo levels. There's a reason the chainsaw now recharges, to get you into that combat loop. 2016 let you go through everything with the Super Shotgun, becoming rather boring later in the game. DOOM: Eternal gives you incentive to use each weapon. Some enemies have weakpoints, areas where if damaged reduce their damage or even mobility. Some weapons/mods do more/less damage to weakpoints, incentivizing you to switch your weapons frequently and again, scan the arena. It's not a mindless shooter where you're constantly killing everything (kinda like 2016 ngl), you have to think about importance of targets, ammo capacity, weakpoints, weapons on hand, mods, and so much more. It's incredible how much fun it is to fly around an arena switching weapons like mad as you cut down the legions of Hell. The story in DOOM games as never been important, but the story in DOOM: Eternal is pretty interesting (at least to me :P). It's handled much better than in 2016, since you can skip any cutscene. 2016 had 2 parts where Hayden just spieled at you for a couple minutes in a tiny room. Now, most of the story is told in skipable cutscenes and Codex entries. Speaking about Codex entries, the secrets in this game are much cooler. While you can't play retro levels as the Slayer, you can play DOOM and DOOM II in the Fortress of Doom. To access the original DOOM, you need to collect every cheat code hidden throughout the levels and in the Fortress. There's also the toys, being models of demons instead of Praetor suit variants. A bit off topic, but the environments are absolutely gorgeous with some of the best level design in DOOM history. Everywhere you look you'll see something interesting, whether it's a dead demon or a grand view the game is beautiful. If you enjoyed DOOM 2016 you will definitely get a kick out of this game. Even if you've never played a DOOM game before, now is a great time to start.\\n\\nMy ONLY negative is that Battlemode is lackluster. Still interesting but definitely needs some more work.\\n\\nSo all in all, this game is amazing, down to the combat loop, environment, exploration, rewards, story, and more. Rip and tear, until it is DONE!\",\n",
       " \"Insane FPS!\\nAfter 20+ hours and the final battle I felt literally exhausted. The gameplay pace is insane especially on the higher difficulties. Demons slaying is super satisfying. New strategic layer demanding using different weapons against different monsters/weak points is an improvement imo.\\nWhile Doom 2016 looks and feels more serious/realistic, this one is a pure entertainment!\\nLoved it's art direction, color palette, arcade-ish approach to pick-ups and UI. If you want some true si-fi horror go (re)play Dead Space, where you are constantly haunted... In Doom Eternal they are haunted, because a Doom Slayer entered the facility!\\nLoved both Doom 2016 & Eternal but find the latter more fun and addicting.\\nWhy 8/10? For two reasons: forced platforming/jumping often annoys, and the game is too short for the money (paid 99 eur for deluxe). More end game activities and/or progression would be appreciated. I know it sounds like a heresy to orthodox gamers, but RPG elements & loot would fit perfectly such game as Doom Eternal. That would truly make it eternal!\",\n",

Its colorful, its arcady, its fun and just great to look at. Makes doom 2016 look like crap in comparison. And to address some of the arguments made by some of the negative reviewers would also not fit in the word cap for the things i have to say about them. but the one thing i will address is \"its to cartoony and arcady. if you loved the last game you are going to hate this one.\"\\n\\n1st) if you loved doom 2016 so much then i would assume that you would have followed the progression of eternal. and if you did do so the you would know that they were going to go with a more cartoony and arcady art style. if you want a gritty serious game you cans stick with cod, doom 3, and doom 2016, while me and the rest of us will have fun with this game.\\n\\n2nd) I know its not only me that loved doom 2016 and currently love doom eternal, right? i mean it kind of speaks for itself  with the overly positive reviews and all.\\n\\ntl;dr) doom eternal is a good game. if you are thinking about buying it, just do it already.',\n",
       " \"Fantastic game all around! Doom Eternal wastes no time in getting straight into the action, as you're given a quick intro cutscene before being dropped into literal Hell on Earth. The game is very fast paced when it comes to the combat, requiring you to make split second decisions that can mean life or death. The level design throughout the game as been changed to help you adapt to the new gameplay style. You'll need to keep moving by swinging, dashing and jumping between platforms and walkways to ensure your victory. This change with the movement coupled with an AI that will show you no mercy make for a shooter that is both fun and a force to be reckoned with.   The story is solid as well, giving a little more backstory to The Doom Slayer through cutscenes that are more cinematic this time around. In addition to that Doom Eternal also expands on the Doom lore and answered some questions fans may have been left with at the end of Doom 2016 via Codex Entries.   The game has also improved with the graphics as well. While Doom 2016 was designed with more horror elements in mind, with darker environments and a color pallet mostly consisting of brown and red, Doom Eternal has a far more vibrant array of colors. Higher quality textures and model improvements for the demons help them stick out from the background more while also changing up a few designs from 2016 to look closer to their original 1993 designs.   With all this the only real gripes I have with the game is I wish it was a little longer and I wish there was more to the multiplayer. I feel Doom 2016 had a story that was longer by maybe a few chapters with definitive Acts in between each major boss. With Doom Eternal I feel like it was all just one really long act.  The Multiplayer is also lacking slightly, with only one game mode at the time of writing this it can get stale after a few matches.   Overall, Doom Eternal is incredible! With many different ways to replay the game once you've completed the campaign, collectables which give rewards such as high resolution models of all of your enemies and soundtracks from previous ID software titles, on top of a gory mess of fun makes, Doom Eternal my FPS of 2020.\",\n",

But overall the combat is sweet, the demons are that much more deadly and stay on you making you react quickly. Level design was dope. Had me looking out of play to see huge statues, buildings etc. I give it a 9/10 because the Multiplayer just wasn’t for me on this one. I loved DOOM 2016 MP as I loved team based 6 on 6 fast combat. Freeze tag was definitely a fun game mode one of my favorites in any game I’ve ever played. But this MP is cool just not for me. Should you pick this up?

       " 'Doom Eternal: The age old and time tested classic returns. For its newest outing. With a different feel and look to Doom 2016 (if I had to put a word on it \"Arcadey\") this by no means hinders Eternal but pushes it forward and delivers in buckets (of blood and guts). First off the soundtrack is great and quite possibly one of my favourite things about the game. With the heavy music hyping you up and letting you know you\\'re in for (excuse the pun) hell of a time, to the gothic hellish chants upon. The music really sets adds to the immersion factor.  That said, as you battle on Earth the dark and heavy feel of the game is momentarily swept away coutsey of a charming sounding female hologram who in her chirpy tone really sells the benefits of a literal Hell on Earth that I found entertaining to listen to and almost willing to invest in due to her confidence and charismatic pitches, but alas demons need brutally slaughtered, so on we push. Visually the game delivers and updates from it\\'s predecessor, with redesigned demons and maps that are detailed and almost picturesque in a hellish sort way. Gameplay is great. The game pits you Humanitys last hope against the hellish demonic legions. Unyielding and relentless in their attack (and that\\'s on easy) leaves you feeling the helplessness of the situation for the Human Race, HOWEVER, you are the slayer, with sickengly well polished and designed mechanics that I\\'m convinced somebody on the dev team sold their soul, the game may be fustrating and give you the odd game over, however it feels like it was your mistake rather than an op demon or some sort of bug that dammed your soul to the firey depth os satan abyss, loading back in making a few adjustments to your play, be it using another weapon, using more of the given map, using the flamer to get some quick armor or maybe being more liberal with the chainsaw use to get ammo. The game challenges you to play better that gives yoy a sense of accomplishment for pushing through. However I don\\'t feel the journey is over just yet and the unrelenting army of Hell is going to lay quiet for too long. Overall: A must have for any FPS fan, needing intense focus this game won\\'t play nicely with others. Even easy can be a challenge.',\n",
       " \"It is a great game. Here are some bullet points for people who aren't sure about buying the game yet.\\n\\nPros :\\n\\nGameplay : Overall, I feel like the gameplay exceed 2016 in mutliple ways. I know some people may not be fan of the monkey bars, but I don't mind them. The climbing wall are a low point though. I feel it enforces you in a vulnerable state where I don't feel totally in control. They feel unilateral since each time you see one, it indicates a place you MUST go. The running and shooting feels great (litle hiccups with some elements like props or wall shutting you off or too complicated level art that causes you to hit collision that you did not see). 9/10\\n\\nVisual : The visual is gorgeous. Perhaps some low points are reuse of some pieces around (like the mechas) or statues with some shader or materials that also could be improve in some places. Other than that, it is mindblowingly stunning. Animation is a treat. FX are awesome. Lighting is delightful. Environments are just crazy. 10/10 for visuals.\\n\\nMusic : 10/10... jesus\\n\\nCons :\\n\\nOverall I feel the game is too stressful. I feel I get PTSD each time I want to get back to play. It is even forcing me to take 1 hour sessions each time. In comparison, I was able to binge 2016. Can't do on this one. It is a con for people that just can't take dying alot and shooting their hearts out.\\n\\nSome features are just plain frustrating. The first time you play, ammo are just... a nail in the foot. You get around later with the battle patterns and using chainsaw on smaller mobs become's a reflex, but for a time, it is really annoying. The purple glue is frustrating in combination with big fights. The collisions around the pools are not clear, sometimes you get stuck trying to walk out. I would fix the collisions to ease out the player path.\\n\\nThe regular punch.... god. It is by far the most low point of this game. Why model DoomGuy with huge biceps if it just to make him push demons around. Gameplay wise, it is a really frustrating change from 2016 where the punches felt great. Please change this.\\n\\nAlot of bugs on my playsession. I don't know how ultra-nightmare works, but 2 times i was forced to just reload last checkpoint. If you can't reload lastcheckpoint in that mode, I think it is a game breaker.\\n\\nI love the game, don't get me wrong. The little nitpicking shows the game high standard.

       " 'I thought this game was gonna be good, but I didn\\'t expect it to be THIS good.1) CombatThe developers have stated again and again in interviews that they want this game to elicit similar strategies to a game of chess.  Each enemy type having specific strengths and weaknesses.  And I must say: they succeeded.  This idea came through beautifully in the finished product!And it wasn\\'t just the enemies.  The Slayer\\'s moveset had some more strategy put in as well!  Most notable is the lack of ammo in your reserves.  You have very little ammo in this game and you\\'re constantly running out.  However, this actually comes off as a plus.  Why?  Because it gives you the opportunity to unleash your chainsaw on the closest demon fodder!  What\\'s more, is that your chainsaw fuel constantly recharges on it\\'s own (and rather quickly too) so you\\'ll never be without ammo if you play your cards right.2) Style ChangeThere\\'s been a slight, but very noticeable, style shift from the last Doom game.  Its surprisingly silly and cartoony, and I\\'m kinda into it.  A lot more Demon punching slapstick.  Plus, the ammo/health pickups greatly resemble the original, magical, floating Doom pickups, giving it a more cartoony/fantasy vibe.  A bit of an adjustment from Doom (2016), but all in the service of making the game more arcade fun.And a bit of a side note:  Eternal is a whole lot more colorful, and I totally dig it.3) Exploration / Level PacingIn Doom (2016), my biggest problem with the game was that the levels were a slog to get through.  This was mostly caused by the fact that I was constantly switching between a combat mindset and an exploration mindset.  I\\'d complete a combat encounter, then explore the area for collectables.  This slowed the game down to a crawl.In Eternal, this isn\\'t a problem.  I can safely skip all the collectables in a level and focus on the combat.  Why?  Because of the simple addition of fast travel; unlocked near the end of each level.  Once I reach the end of a level, I can fast travel back to key sections and find everything I need to make my inner collector happy!And if you don\\'t care about searching the level for weapon upgrades, you can skip exploration entirely!  You\\'re awarded these through combat challenges as well.  So don\\'t worry if you\\'re not into playing hide n\\' seek with collectables.4) StoryProbably the most divisive part of the game are the prominince of the story and cutscenes.  Not to worry!  If you\\'re not into that, they aren\\'t essential to you\\'re enjoyment, and they\\'re completely skippable. (Except for the opening 30 seconds, but it\\'s not story based or anything like that.)Of course,  if you\\'re like me, you will be very interested to see where the story goes.  There\\'s a whole lotta story beats involving the Slayer\\'s past that I think y\\'all will like.  I certainly did.  Anyways, its kept rather vague, so if you want to know everything, better bust out those Codex entries.However, if you\\'re not interested at all in the story there are still some Codex entries you might get a kick out of!  Take a look at \"History of the Sentinals - Part IX\" (Last 2 Paragraphs), \"History of the Sentinals - Part XIV\" (All of It), and \"Super Shotgun\" (Last Paragraph).  All of those are pretty badass.5) SummaryThe only thing keeping it from a 10/10 are some minor nitpicks.  This game is amazing and I highly recommend it.',\n",

The hilarious number of \"0s\" and \"1s\" from people, many of whom admit to having only played an hour or two, should be an indicator that a bunch of dweebs decided to brigade against it for some reason other than the actual quality of the game. A great mix of action, puzzles and plight platforming that puts a bigger emphasis on fighting strategically than the first.',\n",

The movement in this game (for some reason a big criticism about this game) is very fluid especially after getting the “Air Control” rune and combined with the good controls, I like it, but I honestly disagree with  about how people say this game focuses on the air movement when in reality it’s **** cool to swing around like a monkey and it’s supposed to help you to get around arena environments easier. Overall I feel like the game does put a lot of pressure on you in terms of ammo, yes I did like how I had a very large supply of ammo in DOOM 2016, but having less ammo ment that I had to be smarter about the weapons I used, since you only have such limited ammo, the game does give you tips for specific characters like for the marauder you need to shoot him when his eyes turn green or for the mancubus that you shoot out his hand cannons, cannons? (plus I loved how fluid the crucible felt like). But obviously you can collect the sentinel crystals all around the game to get more health, armor, and ammo. Something else that came out to me is some people are saying how the story is flat, it’s a doom game, it’s not supposed to be a game based on a huge ass story.Now my only complaint is about the Battlemode (which gave this rating a 9) Now yes I do know it isn’t the “show” of the game but when I played  battlemode for the first time playing as the slayer I was being pretty overwhelmed about the amount of things you have to take in, take for example, needing to pay attention where the demons are, needing to chose the right time to use the chainsaw etc. Those did not really affect me afterwards but some of the demons are pretty strong in there own ways, especially the marauder. But overall, it’s a cool idea, but it was just kind of if ID threw a dart at a board blindly and almost got to the bullseye but didn’t really hit it at all.But I can highly recommend this game for mostly its campaign.

The exploration is better, collectibles and secrets are fun to find and unlock. The sceneries and locations are beautiful to explore and look at whilst the gameplay is the classic rip and tear that intices the lovers like me. Gameplay is fluid at a stable 60fps with no slowdown. Glory kill animations are fluid and gory as DOOM can be with variations depending on angle of glory kill. The weakness areas are a cool new thing they added to change up the combat a little. Everything about this game is brilliant.StoryWithout any spoilers the story is absolutely brilliant and doom slayer is bigger and more badass than the previous title. The length of the campaign is at a reasonable length.To rap this up I can definitely see this being mine and many others goty contenders.I have no negatives about this game at all so I'm giving the game a full score of 10/10\",\n",

Doom Eternal is for me a 666 out of 10 would definitely recommend.',\n",

       " 'The game is so much fun for different aspects. The game is a follow up to one of the best fps I ever played, doom(2016). The mechanics are based on the previous game and even better. The mechanics of guns make shooting fun and tactical since every gun has in most cases 2 (except the double barrel shotgun and BFG-9000) along with the mounted shoulder grenade launcher. You can upgrade your gun mods as well as the suit and the abilities it has to offer. Also getting ammo and health is fun, by using the chainsaw as a necessary mechanic for getting ammo has made it key and fun since it makes you not only get ammo easy but also fun to watch on how detailed the animations of teared demons are. Also you cannot use it always as it has a cooldown and forcing you to get gather more fuel for higher demons so you don’t spam the thing. As the previous game did it, the glory kills are the way to get health in crucial moments during fights and as it was, the animations are so fun to watch. The game has some nice story though is not as deep as I though but it’s good since the combat and gamplay is the strongest feature. You now have a base which is greatly detailed and has some nice unlockables although it could have more elements that could make it more fun, but it is fun to explore. Overall it has become my favorite FPS of all time and I love what they did to refresh the franchise. Oh and the music is hands down a master piece. This franchise has amazing and talented people behind it, I hope other franchises do what they are doing.',\n",

It knows that the real horrors are the ones happening in human brain, and it capitalizes on that perfectly. I hate horror games with all my might but I just couldn't get enough of this one, with its survival elements that add a whole another layer to it.\\nAs for any downsides, I wish the gameplay on the 2nd run had more differences at least in the story, so when we put it together it actually starts to make sense, and so it isn't just a iteration of the previously played one.\\nI absolutely loved this game and with this one they've got a new fan in me.\",\n",

I am doing a complete run of all the Resident Evil games and as much as I enjoyed the ones leading to this addition to the series, I am thoroughly enjoying RE2 even more. The graphics are exceptional, controls with well enough precision, story compelling, fun additional content, a good assortment of weapons, and zombie butt kicking that measures off the charts with fun.\\n\\nThis game has a great deal of replay value, with content and variations that only playing again can you visit and experience. The story continues to expand with each playthrough, up to two runs for each Lean and Claire. Once I completed my play through of all the RE games released, I might find myself back at this one for some zombie crushing fun.\\n\\nThe character hopping in mid-story is very enjoyable. The extra segment characters (little girl with Claire and woman with Leon) have skills and play style requirements unique to them, and enjoyably implemented. It took me 3 tries to get the additional achievement for the women, but only 2 for the little girl, apart from the one acquired for completing their segment. Even still, I did them both an extra time after for good measure.\\n\\nI have yet to get a grade of S+, but getting S is relatively easy. The controls are worlds better than RE Zero and RE Original, which is to be expected by the basis of their release. Even so, I find myself enjoying being able to aim and move with a much greater degree of control. The characters animations in these actions are also brilliantly done.\\n\\nIn all, Resident Evil 2 is a superb game, and I highly recommend it. The gore factor might put off the squeamish, but it will delight the zombie slayer in you.',\n",
       " \"1998 yapımı Resident Evil 2'yi oynamamış biri olarak yeniden yapımı oynayıp bitirdim ve oyunun harika olduğunu söylemeliyim. 98 yapımı sürümü oynamadığım için hikaye ve bölüm tasarımı konusunda yeniden yapımın orijinale ne kadar sadık kaldığını bilmiyorum ancak tek başına ele aldığım zaman bu oyunun oldukça başarılı olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Oyunda seçebildiğimiz iki karakter var; Leon Kennedy ve Claire Redfield. Ben oyunu Leon ile bitirdim, Claire ile de bitirecektim ancak hikayesinin birkaç sahne dışında neredeyse Leon ile aynı olduğunu öğrendiğim için vazgeçip Claire'ın hikayesinin farklı bölümlerini internetten izlemeye karar verdim. Oyunun hikayesi biraz kısa, ve hikayenin büyük çoğunluğu karakolda geçiyor bundan dolayı biraz sıkılabilir bazı oyuncular. Ama bölüm tasarımı, vuruş hissiyatı ve grafikleri oldukça güzel. 6-7 saatlik bir oyun için ortalama hikayesi var, normalde bu kadar kısa oyunlarda hikaye anlatımı ve hikayenin kendisi zayıf olur ancak bu oyunda ortalama bir hikaye anlatımını yakalayabilmişler. Oyun kısa sürdüğü için bazen hikayedeki kopukluklar ve aniden gelişen anlamlandıramadığımız olaylar aldığımız keyfi biraz düşürebiliyor. Oyunun kötü karakteri Mr. X de bence iyi bir kötü karakterdi ve aniden duvarı yıkarak karşımıza çıkması veya bize doğru yaklaşırkenki yankılı ayak seslerini duymak güzel bir gerilim kattı oyuna. Oyunun kendisi çok korkutucu değil ancak mekan tasarımları, sesler gerçekten de gerilimli ve bu gerilimi hissetmek güzel. Vuruş hissiyatı konusunda da oyun başarılı, düşmanı vurduğumuzu hissedebiliyoruz ve yeterince güçlü silahlar ile vurduğumuzda düşmanın kafasını veya uzuvlarını koparabiliyoruz, bu da aldığımız keyfi daha da arttırıyor. Oyundaki bulmacalar yer yer sıkabiliyor, bazılarında takıldım ve uzun süre devam edemedim, bazılarını da yapabilmek çok uzun sürdü. Aynı zamanda bir yerden sonra bulmacalar tekrar etmeye başlıyor ve olay daha sıkıcı bir hal alıyor. Grafikleri 1080p yüksek ayarlarda 2019 oyunu için güzel görünüyor, ancak bazı yerlerde kaplama hataları mevcut, bazı dokuların yaklaştığımda yüklenmesi gerekirken yüklenmiyor ve düşük çözünürlükte kalıyor, bu da haliyle kötü görüntüye sebep oluyor. Optimizasyon konusunda genel olarak sistemimle sabit 60 FPS elde edebildim, ancak bazı sahnelerde FPS düşüklüğü ve takılma sorunu oluyordu, onun dışında bir problem yaşamadım. Resident Evil 2 bana kalırsa her oyuncunun oynaması gereken çok güzel bir yapım.\",\n",

The atmosphere is at its finest, sometimes you\\'ll feel very scared and apprehensive, and other times on a adrenaline rush to survive or on the edge of your seat trying to survive. The soundtrack is amazing, putting emotions in you and helping the immersion to work. The controls and mechanics are modern which i loved so much, trying to put the series on a next level, and for me, worked completely. The puzzles are in a medium difficulty, which is good because the game is targeted to the mainstream public, so not so many people will find them too easy neither too hard. The Ending is a plus one, because i felt that it really shift your mood when you get there, all the tension that was built up through the game is ended there, giving you a great relief sensation. The design quality of the overall game is stunning, i don\\'t want to spoil something, so i wont give details.\\n\\nI\\'ve only good said good thing about the game, and then you think, \"what\\'s up with this game? it has no flaws?\", like everything is this world, it has, but is not THAT flaw, is that acceptable flaw which you\\'d wished it was different, but its okay. I took some time to say that and also separated of the paragraph above to show why it didn\\'t impact the final score. So here it is. The plot... some article somewhere in the Internet, before the launch, gave the idea that the game would have two COMPLETELY distinct story lines, but when you play, they are distinct indeed, you go to places in a different order, the objectives of each character is different, and both of them have a unique side partner with a unique mission on a part of map only for them, but also you go to the routes never seeing almost never seeing each other and fight with the almost the same bosses that \"die\" in the same way which, plot-wise, is pretty contradictory, but this is just a mere detail, cause you still got different cut-scenes to the beginning of the fight with the bosses and some interactions.\\n\\nI already played +100 hours and im willing to play another, really made that child back there proud. For this and that i consider this game a masterpiece and a real 10/10.',\n",

       " 'Resident Evil is a series that passed me by when I was a kid and the series was at its peak. I played one of the early games back in the day but never finished it because I struggled with the controls and camera. I decided to try out Resident Evil 2 because I saw a playthrough on YouTube and I’m glad I did.\\nThe game has received a massive Graphical overhaul and although it stays true to the original game there is a whole new section and monster to deal with whilst the tension and atmosphere feel fresh. I’ve never played a game with such a sense of hopelessness before as my resources dwindle.\\n\\nYou can play through RE2 with either Leon or Claire and whilst both playthroughs will take place in the same setting there are differences to each. It’s well worth playing through both possibly multiple times. Zombies are very well done in RE2 as are the rest of the monster roster with varying degrees of difficulty and ways of bringing them down. The quiet moments of the game get your heart pounding as you edge your way through the darkness. The narrative is well done and whilst it maintains some of the cheesiness of the originals it feels very up to date in this remake.\\nRE2 look stunning. The dark areas are proper dark, and the map is filled with detail. The animations are fluid and believable and the map in general just feels believable. The puzzles are meaningful and the added stress of worrying about the resident ghoulies really sees you making some funny errors even in the simplest of tasks. The 3rd person camera feels great and the character models nicely detailed. Performance wise RE2 never put a foot wrong.\\nPlaythrough on the normal difficulty took me between 7 and 8 hours for each character and I definitely see replay value as I am sure I’ll be playing through again. Capcom show here how a remake should be done and I hope they give some of their other games similar treatment.',\n",

El matiz resulta muy distinto al de la obra original, sin salirse ni un segundo de su intención primera.\\n\\nEl compás del avance es excelente. El viaje desde un ambiente seguros a otro destila incertidumbre. La generación de empatía con los protagonistas se profundiza en diálogos y scripts. Los zombies surgen destrozados pero amenazantes. La propia comisaría expone algo único.\\n\\nLa segunda entrega de la serie recibe una transformación que, casi 21 años después, la colocan nuevamente en el podio del gaming. Si fuesen películas, la de 1998 representaría formato clásico con planos definidos que van construyendo escenas.

       " \"Resident Evil 2 is one of the best examples on how to properly remake a 20 year old classic bestselling game, by embracing what worked back in the day, see what could be improved and also adding a lot, and I mean really a lot, of new stuff so it still feels interesting and fresh, but also leaving the player with a feeling of familiarity, especially if one has played the original game.\\n\\nThe RE Engine has proven to be very well performing on its previous game, RE 7, and this time around in RE 2 it really shines. We have a very nice Physically Based Rendered assortment of materials and shaders, with a lot of wet surfaces that look amazing, and performance is really, really good on a wide array of PC configurations, with a decent level of scalability, especially on the GPU side of things. The engine seems to make decent usage of 4-6 core CPUs, but it’s usually GPU limited, which normally is the ideal situation when it comes to good looking PC games.\\n\\nThe amount of customizable settings we have in this PC version of the game is also immense, from FOV adjustments to nice mouse sensitivity sliders for camera and aim modes (although there is a slight amount of negative acceleration, very little), and keybinds are mostly fully customizable with the exception of a couple of hardcoded keys like ENTER or DEL; I am left handed, so I use the right side of the keyboard a lot, around the arrow keys (used for movement), so I was able to play with no issues with my usual left handed binds, minus DEL and ENTER but the game doesn’t really need so many keys, so I managed. Gamepad works fine in the game, you can walk slower with it than with the keyboard, in case you need a little more immersion, but it’s not mandatory. There’s this bug I guess that makes it impossible to open doors when in aiming mode, walking with the keyboard, while you can when using the gamepad, but it’s not game breaking and you can still walk normally without aiming, open it a little, then switch to aim mode and It’ll get pushed slowly if you want, so no big deal there either.\\n\\nAn important thing to note about settings is Brightness calibration, you must abolutely do the steps to calibrate this, if you want the game to look as the developers intended, otherwise it'll have this grey'ish haze all over the screen, and dark zones won't look good enough. If you cannot complete the third step on the calibration menu (make the left typewriter disappear), that means you either didn't select the proper MIn/Max levels earlier, or your screen needs some serious tuning and adjusting of brightness and gamma, so better get on that then too.\\n\\nAnd then we have the new gameplay mechanics, like knives and other sub-weapons, the new puzzles and the revamp of old classic ones, which will certainly make you smile, and of course the new way of doing the classic A/B runs, in this case called “2nd run”, which like the original game, it will tell us the story from the other character’s perspective, around the same time the other character did his/her stuff, more or less, with some clever variations added so the gameplay feels balanced but still challenging enough. In summary, to fully complete the story, we still need to do both scenarios, whether Leon first / Claire second, or vice versa…that’s your choice. Completionists will want to do all four of them, and the game records all these different combinations so yeah, it’s nice that the feature is still there, albeit a bit different.\\n\\nOf course, the main change from the original, is the camera and I have to say it really fits this new imagining of the game, it simply works well, really well actually and in a fully rendered 3D world with lots of cool materials and very detailed enemies to mutilate and shoot, it would've been bad if the old fixed camera was used, or the tank controls too, which usually work well together but not so much when separated like it was the case in RE 4.\\n\\nOverall this game feels like a very solid GOTY candidate so early in the year, which is amazing. This game has become one of my favorite RE games of all time, because it demonstrates that the survival horror genre, which the original games were paragon of, can still be brought to modern platforms, with improved techniques, amazing sound design (and boy, is the sound design great here, it even has Dolby Atmos and Binaural…really great), and new ways of solving old puzzles or see them reimagined.\\n\\nI am ready for more Resident Games like this, Capcom, thank you for the great job on this game, made for the fans of survival horror, and for the gamers in general. Capcom, you did it, this is how you remake a game, period, and that means a well earned 10/10.\",\n",

The content itself pulls out emotions of joy and sadness that captivate you through the amazing story, enchanting scenery/zone designs, and character development.\\n\\nAside from the story and zones the additional content added to the game such as job changes bring a refreshing improvement to the job actions that makes them more fluid and enjoyable to play. The new jobs Reaper and Sage are not only creative but engaging jobs that excel expectations in gameplay and design. They lie amongst the most interesting and fun jobs to play not only for their respective roles but in the entire game and MMO genre.\\n\\nThe servers have been facing minor issues (such as queues and login errors) as any new MMO expansion faces but Square Enix has provided daily updates on the status of server improvements and has been attempting to combat the issues as best as they can. Users have even been provided with free game time as compensation for the few issues. Considering the semi-conductor shortage that has made it near impossible for them to acquire the proper server technology to rid users of the server issues completely their active communication and determination convinces me that the minor server issues will be resolved quickly.\\n\\nAll in all Final Fantasy XIV's Endwalker expansion is arguably their best work to date and any fan of the game will appreciate the thrilling and emotionally impactful end of the Hydaelyn and Zodiark saga.

All the characters have their due end, all the villains and everything that we have learned since we joined the Scions of the Seventh Dawn has concluded. Personally, the villain of this expansion was a bit of my duty, but that's mostly because I adored Emeth-Selch as a well-written antagonist in ShadowBringers. From then on, this expansion does not introduce many new things to the lore of the franchise, but rather tries to close the ends of all the subplots that we have lived through. Yes there are new things or rather things that we did not know to date, but everything is an expansion of what was already presented before. The dungeons and trials are the best in the game, with an incredible soundtrack that adds new songs and remixes of what you've heard before that leaves you tied to the chair. All the classes of the game are very well balanced and all are fun to play, there is no one that is above the other, it depends on the tastes of the player and how they decide their experience to be.

For much of the 8 hours I've put into it, I had a giant smile on my face. Many times I would break out in excited laughter, for just how clever many of the levels are and the secrets hidden throughout.\\nWith a $40 price tag, I wouldn't blame you for hesitating to buy it and wanting to wait for a sale.

Yes, there are other good VR games, but they are short. Or long games, but these are ugly with low resolution.

And for this reasons it is such a blast. It is not such because you are playing awesome game. But you are experiencing and exploring someting new that you never seen and experienced before.

I can only compare my experience with this game to how i felt when i first played Mario 64. It's so fun and unique, that i find myself playing whole levels with a smile in my face!\\n\\nVR does add most of the magic, but even without it, Astro Bot would be a good game. The visual direction is beautiful, the gameplay is simply perfect and adds tons of new unique ideas. The best part is that both, new and old mechanics, work equally well, and with a surprisingly high level of polish. They also implemented mechanics from older games, but they don't seem forced. The whole gameplay formula reminds of 3D Mario games (but with its own identity), and there are subtle 'easter eggs' everywhere...like the formation of the levels, reminiscent from Kid Chameleon.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is also fantastic. Every single song is memorable.\\n\\nThe only negative aspect i see is the lack of a harder mode. Once we finish the campaign, it would be cool to have the option to play a more challenging version of each level (no checkpoints, faster moving platforms, tougher enemies, etc.).\\n\\nI just hope this game sells as much as it deserves, because after Astro Bot, a sequel would be a day one to me.\",\n",

This game combines many lessons and highlights from other platformers and VR games and yet manages to carve out its own unique identity.  Astro Bot has a ton of ideas of its own also.  It reminds you of a mario game where as the game goes on, you’re introduced to new mechanics and play styles all the way until the end.  Each level is a work of art and quite unique.  I could go on and on about this game, but take my advice (as someone who owns 3 headsets), Astro Bot is a major breakthrough for VR GAMES — not tech demos — actual games that feel like games and are uniquely suited to VR.',\n",

The last time I probably really looked forward to a platformer was during the Sega Saturn days with Sonic the Hedgehog.\\n\\nBut something about the trailers for Astro Bot caught my attention. The trailers showed a game that looks like it was creating new ways to game by using VR. So I bought Astro Bot.\\n\\nI can honestly say that not only did the game live up to the trailers, it has surpassed them. Astro Bot creates worlds that allow you to do things that flat gaming simply can't do. The way you interact with the environment simply isn't possible without the use of VR, and the team that created Astro Bot has done some extremely creative things, surpassing some of the great things that have already been done in VR by other games.\\n\\nAnd the love and attention that went into making this game really shines.

All of the little nuanced flourishes in the interface and environment show that there was a ton of love put into the production of the game.

       " 'I thought I’d be done looking at VR games for a while, but alas, here we are. After completing games like “SUPERHOT VR” and “Blood & Truth,” I expected that my VR time would merely be spent clocking hours in “Beat Saber” and “MLB Home Run Derby VR” (the latter’s actually rather fun, I might say) until Sony decided to bombshell us with some larger VR announcements. That said, my brother decided to buy a copy of “Astro Bot: Rescue Mission” after trying out “THE PLAYROOM VR” (a free, glorified tech demo for the game) and he very highly recommended that I give it a whirl. I tried one level in it, but was immersed so much in it that it became a title I absolutely needed to play through. And now that I’ve beaten it, I can say it’s definitely a pretty great VR adventure.\\n“Astro Bot: Rescue Mission” advertises itself as a 3D mascot platformer with a VR spin to it, and I can certainly say it looks the part. The visuals are colorful and very sharp (even though the VR can often downgrade those a good bit), the sound design is very strong, with clever sound effects and catchy music, and the game plays as well as your standard 3D platformer would play. What gives the game an edge over said standard 3D platformers, though, is how well it integrates the VR into its play. I worried about how necessary the VR would be to a 3D platformer, especially one that used a regular control, but I can assure you that “Astro Bot: Rescue Mission” feels like it couldn’t have been done without the VR. Having the VR serve as your in-game camera provides a fantastic new twist on the 3D platformer, and the way that the VR plays with things like depth perception is so fantastic and clever (it also doesn’t hurt that there are a ton of “wow factor” moments coming from things like having your head under water, birds randomly flying by you, etc.). And fortunately, while you will be moving around a bit, the movement is minimal enough that this won’t make you as dizzy as, say, “Blood & Truth” will (it also helps that “Astro Bot: Rescue Mission” is easier to play when sitting down, too). There were several points while playing where I felt like “Astro Bot: Rescue Mission” could be to the VR what games like “Super Mario Bros.” was to the platformer genre, and what “Super Mario 64” was to 3D gaming.\\nFor much of the early game, I had a feeling this could’ve been my first 10/10 rating for a PSVR game, and I felt all ready to crown the game as the best title available on VR. However, I started to find a few problems with the game. To be completely honest, I felt the game honestly could’ve been a bit shorter. I know that might seem bizarre, given that some VR games need to be short so that you don’t make yourself sick wearing the headset, but in the case of “Astro Bot: Rescue Mission,” while the game starts excellently, around the last few worlds, the game sort of crawls its way to the finish. By the end of World 3, the game seemed to have exhausted a good deal of those “wow” moments I mentioned earlier, to the point where the last few worlds just feel a bit lackluster by comparison. Not only that, but by that point, you do start to notice that the level design gets a bit repetitive, and while the levels are beautifully-crafted, they start to feel too same-y by that point.\\nEven so, while the last few worlds do take away from the game a tiny bit, “Astro Bot: Rescue Mission” is still a pretty great VR title. It might not be my personal favorite game on the VR (“Beat Saber” and “SUPERHOT VR” are still a good deal ahead of it), but the game definitely expands wonderfully on a tried-and-true formula, providing a game that serves as a pleasant introduction to VR for younger audiences, while a charming and clever enough one for older audiences. As one of the leading exclusive titles for the PlayStation VR, I can see this being a system-seller, and it’s a definitely a game to try if you own Sony’s virtual reality headset.\\nFinal rating: 8 out of 10 “Great”',\n",
       " \"Charming is the word that best describes astro bot. When I saw the design for the first time it looked extremely generic but they managed to convey a lovability personality through this design. The game is a linear 3d platformer in vr and it nails what all 3d platformers must nail control. Astrobot handles like a dream as he jumps hovers and punches enemies. At times your controller is given abilities like spraying water and ninja stars, which reminds me a bit of nintendo land and other early wiiu games. These give the game the variation it needs to keep from going stale. The levels are fun and varied with level themes changing level making no level look or feel the samw as the last. The soundtrack while not having many tracks is realy enjoyable listen to adn you don't get sick of any of the tracks even if you hear them every couple levels. The game also has fun bosses that while being quite easy are a lot of fun to take down. For the completionists there are 8 bots and a chameleon to find in each level. The chameleons unlock challenge levels that will moderately test you but platformer veterans will have no issue. The use of VR in a 3D platformer is inspired and the developers ring most of the potential out of the concept with having you look around corners and from a birds eye view. It's the game I have played VR and is a must play for PSVR owners.\",\n",

The play is fun, clever, always a joy, however, the environments, the immersion of this game in VR, is where this title shines the brightest.  I loved this game so much I gave it two standing ovations during the credits sequence (and, post credits, there is over 10 hours additional content to do!)\\n\\nAstro-bot is platforming genius.

That's it. No block, no dash/evade, no way to avoid getting hit and as I've mentioned getting touched means getting hit. The enemies are very agile and have a long reach, you yourself are very small and cover a short area, which leads to a lot of cases where you are being hit while trying to hit.\\n\\nIn short, the combat is abhorrent!\\n\\nThere is no learning curve like what you had in the Souls games, where if you could overcome a difficult enemies/sequence you could get past it by learning from mistakes, learning new moves and strategies. There's none of the here, as the game is very straight forward.\\n\\nThe platforming is probably the worst offender, it has this this awful downward attack that you have to use to get through some parts which is a pain to archive on the Joy-con. Add to that tight jumping sequences where you are harassed by enemies you cant avoid...\\n\\nSome enemies respawn while you rest at a bench, others respawn if you exit an area, making making it feel very inconsistent. The area maps that you have to purchase, which is incomplete when you buy it, also updates new areas you've been through while resting at a bench.\\n\\nYou have to grind your ass off to buy basic game mechanics, like maps, map pins, etc.\\n\\nOverall I think this game tries so hard to be a 2D souls but falls flat due to all of the above, instead being nothing more than an over hyped poor attempt with pretty aesthetics.\\n\\nAs it is, the game is unplayable and enjoyable without a scale back on the difficulty, maybe with a easy mode added.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Souls like, you won't find it in Hollow Knight.

Highly recommended.\",\n",
       " \"I'm at one of the final bosses and about at about 88% completion. This game is fantastic. If you like platformers and Metroidvania-style games, this is one of the very best to be released in recent memory. I waited to pick it up for the Switch, as I like many other folks are drawn to sinking in the time on the switch version because of the portability. If you haven't played metroidvania-types before, the games are founded on a progression system that slowly but dramatically improves your mobility and combat skills while allowing access to areas - most of which are interconnected - as you obtain new skills.\\n\\nThe combat and platforming is incredibly tight. The variety in skills and customization afforded by the crest system is deep and satisfying to experiment with. Boss battles are varied and intense; difficult but fair. Enemy and area variety are exemplary.\\n\\nWhat makes this metroidvania so special, besides the excellent execution of the fundamentals, is the art style, world development, and Darksouls inspired story-telling and emphasis on pattern-learning to progress past certain enemies and bosses.\\n\\nThe game has some difficult bosses and platforming sequences especially with optional bosses and collectible items like the Grubs that are scattered across the enormous map. But nothing feels cheap and the game never gates progression behind particularly difficult content.\\n\\nAlso cheers to Team Cherry for their persistent support of the game with meaningful patches and free DLC. True mark of an earnest and well-intentioned developer.\\n\\nThe game, unlike other ports, seems to run just as well on Switch as on PC. I guess the resolution could be higher (I'm playing on a 1440p monitor) but I believe it is constant 1080p and 60fps as I haven't noticed any slowdown. Loading times are also negligible.\\n\\nThere isn't a ton to criticize here. I wish the player-map-icon functionality wasn't necessarily tied to the charm system. I have over 30 hours in the game and probably another 5 or so to go before 100%. I did find myself wandering around and backtracking a good deal. You get map icons later in the game that help in locating items and essence sources but without a map from the web and/or a solid plan on what you want to do, it's easy to get a little lost and 'waste' time not getting anything done. It can be frustrating but it's a small price to pay for a cunning and expansive map rife with secret passages, whole areas, short-cuts, hidden items, and bosses.\\n\\nThe combat again is impressive. It starts out so simple but by the end of the game you have an impressive tool-belt and loads of customization options. Adding to the satisfying combat is the sound effects and music. I remember when I first started the game being impressed with the muffling of sound that occurs when the knight takes a hit; kinda like have your bell rung. It added a weight to the combat that persisted and grew throughout the game. The music is similarly well-composed and the voice effects of the NPCs are downright infectious ('ba-pa-nada').\\n\\nI can't believe how cheap this game is too. $60 would not be absurd for how much quality time one can spend with this game. They are charging $15.\\n\\nIf this game even piques your curiosity, buy it. One of my favorite Switch titles and second only to BotW in terms of hours logged. Team Cherry puts Australia on the map for game development and I'm looking forward to what those folks have in store for us in the coming years.\",\n",

       " \"Hollow Knight tries to be a modern Metroidvania and exceeds greatly at it. Simple but very fun gameplay, extremely expansive lore, and amazing boss fights, huge areas that are intriguing to explore, and many different enemies to fight. One thing I don't like much however is the lack of many weapons and ways to attack. Unlike Casltlevania: Symphony of the Night or even Metroid. You got a standard sword that goes in many directions that's length you can extend and that's about it. No sub-weapons or entirely new weapons. Other than that it's an excellent experience.\",\n",
       " \"You know what I never wished that I could be? A bug. But I played Hollow Knight. And I loved every second of it. If you're looking for a negative review of this game, look elsewhere. However, I will be attempting to be fair in my assessment, so let's dig in.\\n\\nLet's start with the thing that will hit you immediately when you pick up the game- presentation. The opening cutscene sets the dark yet loveable tone that haunts you throughout. Once your character (who has no name, but I will refer to as ‘the Knight’) drops into the opening area, you get to see the game’s art style, and it’s fantastic. The game looks like a cartoon. Every NPC, enemy and boss you’ll encounter (and you’ll encounter a lot) stands out well from the background, but still feels like part of the same cohesive whole. You’ll never find something that feels out of place; the spiders in Deepnest match the grim and dark caverns they reside in, for example. Those backgrounds are beautiful as well; the lighting is subtle but effective and the backdrops give the world and areas a sense of scale and wonder. Almost all of the areas feel very distinct (except from Greenpath and Queen’s Gardens, which feel rather similar) and some are simply breathtaking. The monotonous rain in City of Tears, the falling corpses of Kingdom’s Edge and the intense darkness of the Abyss (to name a few) are simply astonishing. Ari Gibson’s illustrations really were something to behold but they hardly hold a candle to the brilliance of Christopher Larkin’s soundtrack. Some tracks are beautiful but with a hidden menace to them, while others are exhilarating. The world is brought alive through the combination of these factors.\\n\\nAnd what a world it is! By my count, there are 19 areas containing over 150 enemies and 46 bosses. Almost all the areas are visually distinct and the world is huge. Don’t fancy anything too taxing? Just go for a stroll and you’ll probably find something exciting to do or see. The world is at the forefront of this game (in much the same was as it was in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) and it’s the world that provides most of the experience. For example: after reaching the Mantis Village and claiming the Mantis Claw, I challenged the Mantis Lords and died very quickly. I had a base level nail and was definitely not adept at the game yet, so it’s no surprise… Quirrel showed up and told me to try the city, but I ignored him and pressed onwards. In fact, I only found out where you use the city crest after finishing the game! Eventually, I defeated the Mantis Lords and pressed past them into Deepnest, which is easily the most creepy and overwhelming area in the whole game. I couldn’t find Cornifer anywhere and was constantly being ambushed by spiders. It took me at least 3 hours to find my way up to the Forgotten Crossroads and it’s experiences like these that make Hollow Knight special. The game can make you feel like you really are lost in a huge Kingdom. The enemies only reinforce this- there’re so many that the world feels diverse, and they’re so different from one another. Some are similar, and many are just fodder for you to smack through, but every single one feels manufactured to fit the experience.\\n\\nSo how do we take down these enemies? Let’s switch over to talking about the combat system and user interface. At the start of the game, the Knight can only jump, swing his nail and move. You gain the heal ability and learn about the importance of soul within the first couple of minutes of playing the game (which makes me wonder why it wasn’t just implemented into your base move set). Over the course of the game, you’ll gain a dash ability, a wall jump, a double jump, 3 nail arts, 4 nail upgrades, 3 spells (and void upgrades to all 3), a super dash and a dash upgrade that gives you dash invincibility on a short cool down. As the game progresses, the Knight does too, making you feel every empowered. Your charm collection (a system wherein you equip different charms with a variety of effects) also expands rapidly, so that by the end of the game you feel not like a stranger to Hallownest, but rather it’s ruler. My issue, however, is that it takes too long to advance far enough in the game that combat feels awesome. I feel like the base move set could’ve been upgraded and new moves could’ve been placed closer to the start of the game, allowing the player to progress quickly. Then, some more extreme, game-breaking abilities could’ve been placed for the endgame as a final twist.\\n\\nThere are many more things that I could talk about; the bosses are great (though some feel more like fodder), the story is phenomenal, the 3 free DLCs greatly expand the game and everything feels cohesive and whole. Hollow Knight is a must play on Switch. If not for a too slow progression to a complete move set, this gam would be a 10.\",\n",

This is the definitive way to play Hollow Knight and I would recommended to all.',\n",
       " \"Only a madman would look at a group of deadly praying mantis enemies as an opportunity, but after becoming a seasoned hollow knight that's exactly what you'll see.\\n\\nI’m The Flannel Fox Tim Swiernik and I reviewed Hollow Knight on the Nintendo Switch\\n\\nBeginning in Dirtmouth a small village above the Hallownest’s Ruins with nothing but your trusty nail by your side your adventure begins.  With a blind leap into the ruins of an abandoned world.\\n\\nIn the beginning of the game you can only jump, melee attack with your nail, and regain health with your soul.  As you defeat enemies you gain soul, when you hold down the A button Hollow Knight can charge back health.\\n\\nThis simple health recharge mechanic is so potent that it forces you to take risks in order to continue.  Where in a normal game if you are low on health, you would turn around and go looking for some or return to your closest regen point.  However, in Hollow Knight you are drawn to battle, with one hit left in your health if you pull off the perfect attacks you can be back to full health in no time at all.  There are so many moments, where you will assess the situation, pause for a moment, then run into battle knowing that one hit could be your last.\\n\\nHollow Knight is a 2d metroidvania and one of the so called souls-like games, referring to the awesomely brutal gameplay in From Software’s Darksouls, Demonsouls, and Bloodborn.  This shows itself in the many different systems in Hollow Night.  For example while on your journey you are collecting geo, the games’ currency, if you die your geo is gone until you find your Shade, after defeat it to regain all that you have earned.\\n\\nAnother reason this is a souls-like, is the brutally different encounters with npcs among the world.  When exploring this beautifully grim environment, I try to be careful when moving into a new area as death is lurking around every single corner.  When faced with a difficult foe you must learn their attack patterns, which can often take multiple lives doing so, in order to come out on top.  Forcing you to get good and to get good fast, it’s so rewarding defeating a boss that kills you so many times, but even more rewarding to encounter that enemy again later in game, and conquering them with ease.  Not because you’ve leveled up or gotten a new weapon, which you do not do in this game, but because you have gotten better as a player.\\n\\nBeing a 2d metroidvania, as you play through the game you unlock new abilities that grant you access do different parts of the map.  This being my first playthrough of the game, I truly knew nothing about it and did not know which mechanics were going to be introduced.  That being said it took me about five hours to stumble upon the wall slide/wall jump, which was thrilling.  One of my favorite 2d mechanics after playing super meat boy, this turned a game with incredibly challenging combat, into a cleverly difficult 2d platformer.  Dashing and wall jumping through thorn covered areas, gave me a huge grin on my face almost immediately, and waiting this long into the game to introduce it made the reveal all worth the wait.  Travelling back to an area in the beginning of a game that you remember specifically when you saw it the first time, then having that lightbulb moment when you get the perfect ability to now go there, is one of the best feelings in gaming and it will never gets old.\\n\\nEach area of the map is broken up into little sections or worlds, but in order to view them on your map you must purchase that area’s map from Cornifier the Cartographer.  Not knowing where to find him multiple times in new ares was getting quite frustrating until you begin to hear some faint humming, then you see his papers on the ground, letting you know that he’s close and you find him to purchase that areas map.\\n\\nAlong with having to purchase a map, you have to purchase the ability to locate yourself on the map, as well as fast travel points, resting benches, and basically everything that is on a normal map.   Not being a big fan of this as spending my hard earned Geo to be able to see blue cocoons on my map, felt like a waste of my money.\\n\\nHollow Knight is an amazing 2d metroidvania and a challenging platformer, will fantastically brutal combat that certainly scratches that souls like itch.  Just as often as I would stumble into a deadly boss battle, I would be rewarded with amazing moments of discovery, accomplishment, and victory.  I can solidly recommend this game to any Switcher who is up for a great challenge.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this game two days ago on my Switch, I've already played over 16 hours and I have not been able to put it down. This is an awesome game, you constantly keep finding new ways to traverse this wonderful world with the many power-ups you discover, so you never really get bored or tired of it. It's definitely a bit challenging at times, but it is never unfair. The music, the animations, the enemies, the joy of finding something new to play with, and many more aspects are what make Hollow Knight a very entertaining and beautiful game that you will not regret buying, specially not with it being 15 bucks and having several free expansions.\",\n",
       " 'I loved it, just what I expected.It is difficult, long and with many things to discover every time we increase the skills.The only thing that would think it would be to tell at the beginning that character we are, that we do there and where we are going.',\n",
       " 'Hollowknight is a challenging adventure, crammed with content and secrets that will keep the player coming back for more.  Exploration is complemented by tight combat and platforming mechanics.  The game oozes immersive atmosphere through it\\'s charming art style,  vague lore, and ambient music.  Reflecting on my 25 hour experience, any gripes i had were few and far between.  Although my experience was rewarding and memorable, be forewarned, the casual gamer may not find this experience enjoyable.\\n\\nHollowknight\\'s mechanics leave every mistake at the players fault.  The player is put in control of a nameless knight.  From the start, the knight has the ability to run, jump, attack in four directions (left, right, up, and down while airborne), and utilize \"soul\" to heal. Jumping isn\\'t dictated like most platformers.  Rather than having a short jump and a high jump, the height of jumping isn\\'t restricted to binary.  Jump height is totally varied based on how long the button is held, allowing for tight platforming sections to be in complete control of the player.  The knight wields a nail.  Which is a sword for insects.  Attacks are executed near instant and have knock back on contact.  Attacking an enemy downward while airborne, if timed properly, allows the knight to bounce consecutively with each successful hit.  This downward attack also makes for interesting platforming sections where the knight must bounce off of spikes and other hazards to progress.  As mentioned above, the knight could also heal through \"soul\".  Soul is essentially a magic meter that charges when the knight lands attacks on enemies.  To heal, the knight must create a safe distance as healing takes a few seconds and could be interrupted by enemy attacks.  This allows for a satisfying \\'risk-reward\\' system where the player must decide if they will heal or sneak in more damage.  The combination of these mechanics (and mechanics you gain throughout your adventure) makes for excellent exploration and intense boss fights.\\n\\nCheckpoints in this game are benches.  At benches the player has the option to switch up charms, which give bonus abilities such as a longer sword or faster attack execution. Switching charms is restricted to benches, so it is important make sure your load out matches what your next goal may be.  The amount of charms the knight can equip is dictated by notches which are found throughout the adventure.   It is possible to equip more charms than the notches allow, but doing so will put the knight in an over charmed state which causes enemies to deal double damage.  When you (inevitably) die, you are returned  to the last bench you rested at.  Upon returning to a bench after death, the knights max soul is lowered, all geo (currency) is lost, and a \\'shade\\' is left behind.  Max soul and geo can be regained by returning to the death location and defeating the shade but beware, if the shade is not defeated and the knight dies before reaching it, the geo is permanently lost.\\n\\nExploration is at the forefront of this adventure.  Hollowknight starts off a bit linear, but quickly branches off into a perplexing cavern of secrets and danger.  As the player explores and defeats bosses, the knight gains new abilities such as a dash and a wall jump.  These abilities allow progress in exploration and access to areas that at one point were inaccessible.  For example, you may come across an acidic lake that can only be traversed after you obtain a certain ability.  Once you gain the ability, the game doesn\\'t hold your hand on what to do with it.  It\\'s up to the player to remember the acidic lake that is now cross able thanks to the knights new found power.  This aspect of exploration is extremely rewarding. Exploration is also rewarded with a seemingly endless amount of secrets, which are a joy to discover.  Each new area leaves you exploring without a map until you stumble upon the cartographer NPC Cornifer.  Cornifer will sell you a map of the area for a reasonable amount of geo.  It can be frustrating to explore an area without a map, but thankfully Cornifer leaves a trail of feathers and has audio ques notifying the player as to when they are close to his location.\\n\\nThe art style Team Cherry chose is both dark and adorable simultaneously.  The world is populated by insects who at times are aloof and at others arrogant (but are always charming).  The backgrounds are detailed and lovingly crafted, while also doing a wonderful job differentiating the games diverse areas. The ambient music and sound design only adds to the polish and immersion. Though the music while exploring is mostly somber, the music while fighting a boss is triumphant and epic, which at time left me with chills and excitement.\\n\\nHollowknight has little hand holding and the \\'risk-reward\\' based challenge isn\\'t for everyone, but if you are looking for a memorable odyssey, look no further.',\n",
       " \"Clearly my personal GOTY of 2018.\\n\\nThis game is brilliant and makes you want to surpass yourself in every way.\\nIt has a nice base gameplay with and incredible gamedesign that pushes the metroidvania to it's finest.\\n\\nThe art direction is amazing and serve the gameplay by making you curious and by encouraging the exploration.\\n\\nThe only downpoint is that the game is sometimes really brutal and some bosses are quite hard.\\n\\nAbsolutely must-play if you own a Switch !\",\n",

Striking enemies recharges your soul meter that you can use to heal, so even when low on health you are inclined to fight on, which makes for some exciting moments when you are lost and low on health in some uncharted area.

This game is one of the best Indie games I have ever played and with the accessibility provided by the switch, it's perfect for planes or any situation that requires the killing of time, definitely pick this one up if you have £11.00 to spare.\",\n",

       " \"One of the best games I've played in a while. Typically I would like to make two lists of what I liked and what I didn't like about a game but if I'm being honest, there's really nothing I would change about Hollow Knight. DO NOT get discouraged if you get lost or don't know what's going on in the game even after 10-15 hours of gameplay! That's normal, the story is a puzzle that you need to put together by talking to characters and exploring.\\n\\nThe Music:\\nThe soundtrack for the game is phenomenal and really adds to the entire experience. For each section of the dungeon we hear a unique song that just really sets the mood for the user. In some areas I feel relaxed despite having enemies attack me but as I travel deeper into Hallownest the music will feel more intense and I feel my nerves creeping up on me to the point of borderline fear.\\n\\nArtwork:\\nHollow Knight reminds you that simple can be beautiful. it's funny that the main character is very cartoon-ish and so are many of the other characters, but for some odd reason when they place these strange looking cartoony bodies onto the backdrop it becomes beautiful.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nYour character feels about as fluid with his movements as water. There is no such thing as a mis-input in this game, 30 hours in and I have never complained that the character did something that I didn't want him to or that he didn't do something that I wanted him to. Oh and the game balances fun and challenge very well between the puzzles and enemies.\\n\\nFinal Recommendation:\\nHollow Knight is a masterpiece of the genre and almost anyone would love it. Having said that, Hollow Knight is a challenging game and although I would basically recommend it to anyone, I would not recommend it to very inexperienced gamers or people who enjoy Easy Mode gaming. The game has one difficulty but it's the perfect difficulty, it gets harder as you get better and I really like that.\",\n",
       " \"Hollow Knight is the game I've been waiting for since finishing Super Metroid and SotN 20 years ago. It is the true successor to both Metroid and Castlevania; the game I always wanted but the game that neither franchise will ever give me again. That being said, know what it is you are getting.\\n\\nI vividly remember playing Super Metroid for the first time. I remember those dark, unfamiliar corridors around every corner, finding horrifying creatures I was unequipped to initially handle, getting lost while searching for important items everywhere. It was both an adventure and a giant puzzle; that was the appeal. If you enjoy Metroid but like more modern/guided experiences like Prime, this may not be for you. Needless to say, if you don't enjoy Metroidvanias in general, definitely shy away from this.\\nHowever for those who truly want a 'let's get lost in a deep cave and fight horrifying, difficult monsters' experience, this is the game for you! Speaking of which, I love how difficult the fights get, it's very refreshing and exhilarating to walk towards an open area, see a large, detailed, menacing figure and actually feel tension and hesitation. That's a RARE feeling in video games today. So many devs pull punches to not alienate modern audiences. This game doesn't. If you want to win, particularly later in the game, you have to fight for that victory and earn it. The music, while not super catchy like in Super or SotN, is very well done and fitting for each area. The graphics, while simple, are gorgeous, especially in some areas. Hollow Knight uses actual 2D animation, which is both appropriate for this genre and beautiful; truly a lost art in this age where so many other games settle for 2.5D.\\n\\nI gave it a 10, but I have some complaints, all incredibly minor and each only deserving of -0.2 or so off the score, so a 10 feels a little disingenuous, but it's definitely higher than a 9! It feels like a solid 9.5, but the scoring system here doesn't allow for that.\\n\\nI will reiterate again, I love how punishing this game is.. in combat. The flow of exploration however is a bit hit or miss, and sometimes punishing in a way I don't like. Don't misunderstand me, it's very serviceable still, but you can royally screw yourself in some situations simply by going left instead of right. Example, I went through the entire Hive area and encountered the boss at the end before realizing there was a single save bench at the start of this new place. If I had just gone left instead of right when I entered, I would have been good. There was nothing in the 'flow' of the level design that made me want to go that direction though. Save locations are pretty important in a game that isn't shy about killing unprepared players. Many of the first saves are marked on signs to help you, cool, however I think most players would have liked a few subtle hints for later ones as well, especially in areas that immediately start with 4+ different routes off the bat.\\n\\nThe music is also almost 100% ambiance, which is ok and fitting for this game, sure. I would have still liked more than just a handful of catchy tunes though, even if that's just a preference thing. I still can't help but compare this game to Super Metroid and SotN (mostly because it's so well made) but that also makes me feel like something is missing when it comes to BGM. Again, this is a preferential nitpick. The music in it is still good, moody and invokes feelings of wonder and desolation, so it does its job at least!\",\n",
       " 'Stellar metroidvania that pulls off the genre flawlessly, while improving on the formula significantly.\\n\\nEverything from pacing, environments, level design, enemy design, boss design, characters, and music feels finely tuned. It starts off slow and empty, but builds into a deep and dynamic world full of mystery as the player progresses. There are challenges to be had, most of them optional, but none of them meaningless.\\n\\nThe game very much takes a \"git gud\" approach to it\\'s challenges, but the difficulty curve isn\\'t too steep. If you find yourself stuck on a section, you would be wise to put a pin in it and explore other sections (in true metroidvania fashion).',\n",

I though it would just be something to keep me busy until I could buy some other main Nintendo titles like Breath of the Wild or Mario Odyssey. But before I knew it, the game had me sucked in, and I've now spent 55 hours on it and completed the game 105%.\\n\\nThe first couple of hours were a bit rough. You feel weighed down by the fact that you don't have much mobility and don't know where to go. But as soon as you get the compass and start having a sense of direction, the game picks up speed.\\n\\nI really, REALLY enjoyed this game. My only drawbacks are the slow start and the fact that most of the story is very vaguely told.

       " \"It's hard to review Hollow Knight and not repeat everything that everybody else has been saying: it's a fantastic metroidvania game, it's beautiful to look at, it's hard, it's vast... But ultimately, all you can give is a short list of the reasons why it's worth sinking dozens of hours (hundreds, in my case) into this game.\\n\\nYes, Hollow Knight is Dark Souls-hard. Sometimes, it asks you to do things that are way beyond your league as a gamer–no matter how good a gamer you are, this game will eventually push you to your limits. And yet, you'll stretch for those limits and eventually surpass them, because the game makes it feel like every victory is rightfully earned.\\n\\nFor me, the depressingly dark atmosphere of Dark Souls was always a put-off. Hollow Knight is also dark in its own way, but its graphics is also cute and crisp, and the mood verges more towards melancholy and reflective. It's impossible not to be consistently sucked in by the gorgeous art style of this game.\\n\\nAnother thing that kept me playing is the awareness that this amazingly vast game was produced by a tiny team of young indie developers. For me, Hollow Knight redefines what is possible to do in gaming. Not ever since the early '80s and the works of Ultimate I've been staring at a screen and wondering how a team of two or three people could ever produce something this amazingly refined. Hollow Knight challenges most 300-people-team AAA titles on their own ground (the sheer amount of content) and puts them to shame in a way that looks effortless.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Hollow Knight is a game to respect. It sucks you in gently, and then locks you up and asks you to achieve impossible feats–and then keeps a stern eye on you and you struggle to comply. Nobody can guarantee that you won't hate Hollow Knight–but it could also be your favourite game ever. It's worth giving it a chance.\",\n",

It\\'s frustrating, its far too difficult for the rigid movement of the game, and overall, it really ruined the experience for me. The Colosseum of Fools was a fun and difficult challenges, which pushed you to the limit to beat, but the White Palace is just not fun. It ruined the whole game for me.

This intrigued me enough to look it up on Nintendo\\'s eShop on my Switch.  As it turns out, Hollow Knight happened to be on sale for $9.99 at the time, to which I thought \"Eh...what the hell.  Let\\'s give it a shot.  It is only $10\".\\n\\nFast forward to today:\\n\\nI am currently 45 hours into this game, and simply cannot get enough of it.

There has been a few times where I\\'ve fought a boss over-and-over for 1.5 to 2 hours straight, but I always seem to find a combat technique or charm that I was not initially utilizing in order to defeat these foes.

This is where a lot of people stop playing which is really sad, because they never get to know what a great game this is. I put down the game for six months, until a friend told me to play it. I started playing again found the next area, and fell in love with it. I couldn't stop playing for days. There are so many areas and so many items and things to do. The controls are smooth and it just feels good to play. At first, it may seem like there is no story, but as you explore, you find out what happened. The game is hard, but once you beat the bosses and learn there moves, they become easier. So even if you got stuck on a boss, which I did many times, if you keep going you can get through it, and the feeling of beating them is amazing. The game has a mode where if you die, you can't respawn. I think this was a great decision to add because after playing it once, you have already learned the game and the bosses move sets. This mode continues the challenge you may have had on your first time playing. This game starts out calm and slow, but by the end you will have learned and gotten better, doing things you may have never thought that you could do.

       " 'Let me preface this review by saying that I\\'ve easily spent more than 50 hours on hollow knight; I\\'ve finished the core game but still haven\\'t done any content from the two major free expansions. There is a game here for the playing, and at a very palatable price.\\n\\nHollow Knight is truly a masterpiece. It is artwork- every environment drawn by hand in a consistent style that has unique flourishes for each local you visit. The music is subtle but effective, drawing you into the game\\'s atmosphere, ever present, never overbearing- it brings to mind the haunting atmospheric music of \"Super Metroid\". And the game-play: this is a metroidvania to the bone, a refinement of the best entries in the genre, exuding far more personality from it\\'s environments than any other comparable game, motivating me to backtrack and explore every nook and cranny.\\n\\nAnd that leads me into my next point, what hollow knight is not. It is not a souls game, as so many have mistakenly labeled it in a poor attempt to define it\\'s difficulty. It is an exploration-focused metroidvania, and it leans decidedly towards the metroid side of that formula. The bosses are almost all optional, the map is an interconnected maze full of secret doors that lead to new areas and new abilities, many of the challenges come from precise platforming segments and tanky bosses with very learnable attacks.\\n\\nHollow knight is a refinement of the best of the metroidvania genre. But, it still falls in some of the same traps that plauge even the greatest of these games. The controls are notoriously punishing for new players, and while hollow knight is better than the archaic and unintuitive super metroid, it fails it\\'s new players by mysteriously mapping multiple seemingly important abilities to a single button while others are free, only to reveal later that some new ability will slot in there: Also, almost everyone who I have had try this game complains that the jumping feels \"wrong\" for the first while. this is because there is no momentum when you jump- (a classic metroid control feature, if you jump from a standstill) unlike in mario, where if the stick is released in the air, the player will continue to move forward, in hollow knight, the character must be precisely maneuvered while in the air and will stop dead in the horizontal if the stick is released. This is by no means bad, and it is in fact more precise than the \"mario\" style jumping, but will leave you frustrated if you don\\'t realize why you keep falling in the spikes.\\n\\nIronically, that frustration is probably hollow knight\\'s biggest weakness. you might have noticed a few reviews or threads in forums that read something like \"I PLAYED FOR THREE HOURS AND THIS BOSS IS DUMB AND THIS GAME IS DUMB AND IT\\'S NOT FAIR\". This is indeed somewhat childish bellyaching, but it highlights a sentiment that you\\'re likely to feel: frustrated. the beginning of the game sees you with the fewest abilities: you have yet to acquire the token dash, double jump, wall jump, ect. that are the bread and butter of \"metroid\" style games. This leaves the character controlling the worst out of the entire experience during the first two or three hours of gameplay. And while hornet, the first real boss, isn\\'t anything next to some of the others in the game- you, the new player, also don\\'t have any \"charms\" (items you can equip to give you small bonuses), or movement options. This is exacerbated by the \"linear\" early game. you can\\'t progress without beating this particular boss, so it\\'s easy to get frustrated.\\n\\nAfter that short segment, though, the game opens up with many different routes, largely solving that weakness, and you acquire the \"dash\" ability, making the player character much more fun to control. if you can be patient with it\\'s steep early learning curve, there is a world of quirky bugs and menacing bosses waiting to be discovered! The game sucked me in, letting me get lost in the deep, winding caverns of hallownest for hours on end. For me, Hollow Knight was without question my favorite game in 2018. And did i mention it\\'s 15CAD$? That\\'s like, amazing. Take a chance on this one, you won\\'t regret it.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nHollow knight is beautiful and brimming with content, but has a steep learning curve, so be patient and you will be rewarded with a gem of a game that is worth every penny.',\n",

Nothing else even comes close. The story is brutal, challenging, bold, and almost never \"fun\". It is harrowing, forcing the player to confront violence in a way video games never do. In a medium where everything is John Wick, HOLLOW KNIGHT is Schindler\\'s List.\\n\\nAnd just like that film, there were times when I wasn\\'t sure I could keep going. It is a relentless emotional assault that I suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. The game is a work of art - every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. Visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. It is astounding. And frequently beautiful.\\n\\nWith moments you NEVER find in video games.  But I cannot overstate how harrowing it is. It feels like 2 seasons of the darkest TV show you\\'ll ever find, and it frequently better than most TV on the air.  That\\'s saying a lot.  I think it is an IMPORTANT game. It tore me up, and I will never, ever forget HOLLOW KNIGHT is a game that will change you.\\n\\nIn short, HOLLOW KNIGHT put me through hell.  I did not enjoy it.  I wasn\\'t supposed to.  I was affected by it.  Like no game before.  I am in awe of it.  I am recovering from it.',\n",

From a new compelling story about liberation from tyranny and the hardships of war, to completely revamping jobs and adding new mechanics, the game has improved by leaps and bounds.\\n\\nGameplay: Stormblood has made several balance changes to PvE and PvP, not least of which is the abandoning of the Cross Class System in favor of a new Cross Role System. This means you no longer have to level something like Thaumaturge in order to be a good healer with Swiftcast, as that is one of your options in the Cross Role menu. PvP has now been given a normalized stat and skill system, resulting in matches that are more heavily reliant on player skill than before, and thanks to the increased potency on almost all skills, PvP has become less of a stalemate fest.\\n\\nGraphics: FF14 is still a game that is very appealing to look at and the new zones continue to impress with their level of detail and visual fidelity for an MMO. From different textures to show erosion on rock, to the interesting architecture of Ala Mhigo and Othard, the art team continues to deliver.\\n\\nMusic: Masayoshi Soken hasn't let us down as he continues to find ways to take a leitmotif and spin it in several interesting ways throughout the different zones and battles. The Royal Menagerie having one of the most climactic themes of any battle yet was wholly appropriate given the scale of what you are undertaking at the climax of the story. I found myself getting so hyped that I would occasionally sing the small chant from the main theme of the expansion during boss fights.\\n\\nIf you're a fan of MMO's Stormblood is a fantastic expansion that builds upon an already strong foundation, and with amazing raids like Omega and Ivalice coming out soon, there's always more content to keep the game fresh on the way.\",\n",

The changes to every job I've levelled to 70 have been at worst meh to me (I'm not a fan of Bard anymore, but it's fine) to great (Ninja is far less of a **** to play). Most of the new music tracks are amazing.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the zones continued the downward spiral started in HW. Most of them are huge with very little interesting things happening. I blame flying. Also swimming was woefully underused. ARR still has the most interesting and unique zones. I was also not a fan of how parts of some zones were completely walled off by the story. Having high level areas be filled with high level aggressive monsters ala ARR is a much better way to go about it.\\n\\nWorth buying if you're already an active player. I wouldn't say it's good enough to change your mind if you didn't like it already.\\n\\nThere's a lot of people **** about the price change. They are dumbasses.

       " 'I played this garbage for 5 years now (in fact I had a review from 4.0), and the only thing I can think of is \"fall in quality\". The game never - EVER - got better in any possible way, not in gameplay or content - and the story is another thing which I\\'ll gladly talk about very soon.\\n\\nIn fact let me start with the story which is, to say it bluntly, completely garbage: I used to follow it during 2.0 and 2.1 and I could not believe how bad it was, it simply wasn\\'t entertaining nor engaging to follow it to the point that I only followed bits and pieces ever since.\\n\\nI am a HUGE JRPG lover, some of my favorite JRPGs are Trails of Cold Steel, Berseria, Vesperia, and old classics like Legend of Dragoon, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger/Cross, the list goes on, but this game flat out fails to tell an entertaining story and at actually engaging you; if you don\\'t follow from the very start, you\\'re basically unable to follow afterwards and making it very noob unfriendly to anyone who even dares to step in.\\n\\nIf at least each expansion was its own separate story - which is how it should\\'ve been - I could at least compare each story by itself and maybe even enjoy them, but nope: have fun following a bunch of morons with no personality throughout plot lines so forced not even lube would help.\\nOh and of course you cannot skip it as they wanted to make it clearly the focus of the game...until they decided to add a jumping potion that allows you to skip to level 60 and begin the story from the last expansion\\nThe story is truly important, but so is money, now pay up if you actually wanna experience the game or enjoy the 548 unskippable quests!\\n\\nAlright now, let\\'s pretend you actually survived the long ordeal and you FINALLY manage to be able to do all the content: at first it is a lot of stuff, I\\'m not even joking here, but you will soon realize that it\\'s a flash in the pan and you\\'ll soon have nothing to do for the rest of the game.\\n\\nFor example there are 50+ dungeons to unlock and clear, which sounds like you\\'ll have a lot of fun doing them, but once you\\'re done clearing you have no reason to re-run them as they give you no incentives or achievements or anything worth a second run. SE seemed to have realized this too and they started giving crappy glamour items in order to give them some more life, but even then it doesn\\'t hide the fact that dungeons have no lasting power. Even WoW\\'s dungeon are still re-run thanks to the achievements and a better transmog function, which ACTUALLY gives a good reason to do them.\\nFFXIV dungeons are, essentially, rotten data.\\n\\nCrafting and Gathering are probably the only two things that seemed to have some lasting power, if they didn\\'t rely solely on complete RNG, which is there only to make it LOOK harder: the potential was there but they ruined it by giving each action a % that will easily screw your rotation and basically make you quit instantly. Fishing is even worse and all you\\'ll be doing is sitting for hours upon hours, hoping to hook the fish you want, hopefully HQ, and then repeat the process until you get better gear, which will become obsolete in few months...fun?\\n\\nAnd there are a lot of side content - or fluff content - that has no real staying power at all: Gold saucer is the prime example with its crappy card game,  LoL copy, crappy Chocobo racing and other minor stuff that you\\'ll most likely never bother with unless you\\'re into collecting crap. Hunts were potentially progress content until it died out because it never innovated, with people preferring doing weekly stuff rather than jump into the toxic pool. Eureka is currently the worst content I EVER played in my entire life, even worse than Diadem, and I can\\'t even recommend it as a joke! Beast tribes are okay but I wish they gave more than 3 quests per day: this takes less than 20 minutes to clear. There are many but it\\'s the daily lockout that will stop you and make it LOOK like it\\'s longer than it should. PvP is okay, but the combat system is clearly not made for PvP and it turns out clunky and just not fun. A shame.\\n\\nAnd now the community, oh dear Lord the community: we\\'re talking about a group that will relentlessly defend this game and its flaws, even at the cost of harassing people or namecalling you.\\nI mean It\\'s not even hard to seek them out: simply mention your dislike for the main story and you\\'ll be stormed by everyone; say that the game is boring and they\\'ll slap you and shout \"go back to wow\" or something; try to say that you\\'re having no fun with the current content and hopefully they\\'ll just ignore you or say you whine a lot - even if that was your only complain.\\nThere is simply no discussing with these people: I\\'ve been playing for 5 years and I safely say \"there is not a single person who was worth calling a friend\". Not even one. I had better times in LoL - or even WoW - than in this toxic cesspool of a community.\\nAs such, I highly recommend staying away from this game and just save your sub.',\n",
       " \"The story was good even if a bit cliche and tropey though the quests (gameplay wise) still were pretty inferior to what WoW does. Zone design was improved compared to HW but copying of assets is still pretty noticeable in areas like terrain doodads. I understand buildings having only 1 or 2 varieties but I shouldn’t see things like the same rock and tree over and over so easily which can usually be dealt with but just rotating an object. Ruby Sea feels like a huge empty zone given the water doesn’t add much actual gameplay either besides swimming. If you’re going to add a mostly water zone you should at the very least add some type of gimmick rather than having it be nothing more than a barren land of emptiness and copy pasted rocks and kelp that you swim through. In general some zones just didn’t feel like they reached their full potential such as the Lochs and Yanxia while others like Azim Steppe were really well done. The zones still feel dead in general when compared to WoW’s where you’ll see NPC’s actually doing things such as bears hunting fish or predators hunting prey and in general FF14 zone design seems to be nothing more than ‘this is the bear area and over there’s the wolf area and this final area is the bird area and the mobs are just all walking back and forth in their little zone’ and doodads just seem thrown into the game world and rarely are blended in.\\n\\nThe main issue with SB right now is that once you hit 70 the game is the same exact game as HW. You do the same 3 dungeons over and over (with high DPS queues) to grind out tomes and in general are doing nothing at all actually new unlike how Legion added Mythic+, artifact weapons, and the world quest system (an improvement of the old dailies system). And of course with Omega they are continuing the convoluted gearing system from Alexander. Square is once again relegating any new systems to patches and we have to hope these new systems are well developed unlike Lord of Verminion and Diadem and even things like the eventual beast tribes may just be the same ol’ 3 daily quests. I’m iffy on this thing Square does where they release a ‘skeleton’ expansion and how they instead put new systems into patches I’m holding out hope that they surprise me with the upcoming patches though given Square has been nothing but predictable with FF14 so I’m not getting my hopes too high. It doesn't help that the one new system, Eureka, has already been delayed making the first patch pretty barren for a patch coming 4 months after release with some of the content not even being patched in till a month after that. So 5 months for everything while in that time Legion released 2 patches following a 77 day release schedule that added far more content than 4.1 is adding.  Stormblood is a mediocre expansion and the playerbase should honestly expect so much better from a company like Square.\",\n",

       " 'This is a second review with the Expansions \"Heavensward\" and \"Stormblood\" taken into consideration, The game is overall \"good enough\", it definitely does not feel like a 100% premium product in most regards simply because the developer does not seem to take into consideration the western audience\\'s wishes as much as one would have hoped, mainly the community is instead revolved around the appeal of the game, However I failed to see the appeal on the release content of stormblood while could see some appeal on heavensward release content and of course the patches, it felt like the budget fell drastically for some reason on stormblood quality-wise both in the narrative and the story itself, it felt like they could have done much more with it but didnt.\\nI still believe one can enjoy the game, the maps though I find very uninteresting to be at, they are look-alike in many ways, I would even say they reused a lot of assets and it is very obvious, even the music pieces are essentially 1-3 per expansion excluding the boss fights of course and *some* dungeons. If someone is not into text-based story telling, simply do not play this game, the voiced narrative is very limited and seemingly random, this game relies heavily on its story and it is 96% text-based at the very least, I would not recommend therefore this game simply for the reason that globally 1 out of 10 people has trouble reading and basically they do cannot enjoy reading because of effects like the different types of dyslexia, the developer does not seem to contemplate the importance of this fact, the game is developed in Japan and then localized by another group of people in the company, the producer\\'s native language however is mainly pictorial which makes it very easy to read once mastered to a degree, therefore the text-based story becomes a breeze to read however once localized, the western system of reading is much more difficult for the brain to decode and therefore the text-based story becomes unpleasant for most people and certainly unbearable for those 1/10 people world wide, which is still a huge number of people. Consider this before you invest into the game, if you can read fast and you like this type of narrative then you will be very satisfied, otherwise do not commit unless you want to train your reading skills, which is something I did, to put it into perspective the 90% of the game time you will spend on your first 1-2 months will be reading the story, it depends on your speed, it is advised to only skip anything that is not in a cut-scene to save some time if you so choose.\\nThe story and its quests are only unbearable for some due to the above, if you want to do a second playthrough you can simply skip through every narrative content by rapidly clicking on your screen, it can still be a bother of course, the game\\'s store has ways for people to either skip or transfer, the game as of right now has limited cross-server capabilities and the server data-centers feel very fragmented, therefore it is very possible that if you do not communicate with your friends on which servers to settle in, you might not play together and for the most part the game is indeed single-player for the first 1-2 months, consider all the above before you commit.

The sheer vastness and complexity of this game make it almost always interesting to log back in and play for a few hours. And so I have been doing, from the release of this expansion up til the current patch (as of Oct 2018).\\n\\nGraphics are better than they have been before. They ditched ps3 support in an effort to allow for bigger areas and other graphical improvements and it shows. It is still a FFXIV, so the aesthetic is the same, but new areas, new skill effects, and new instances are absolutely great.\\n\\nMusic is great, as it has always been. A bit too militaristic in some places for my taste, but plays into the overall theme of the expansion. And the new themes for new primals and other trials are beautiful, each better than another - and with such variety I haven't heard in not only other MMORPGs, but other games in general.\\n\\nNew jobs (classes) are pretty good too. Even though they only introduced two dps, they differ enough to make for an interesting experiment (my main hasn't changed since ARR). My only complaint about them is that they don't feel complex enough on higher levels, but that's the situation with many other jobs. Speaking of which, the ability rework is not the highest point of the expansion. Removing and reorganizing many of them was necessary b/c there were just so many, but I feel they could have done better. Expansion to core kits for many jobs do not feel like natural progression, instead it often feels like a few new abilities have been plopped on top of a fleshed out class. All in all, most of it works out well and slight corrections since the initial release have improved the situation anyway.\\n\\nThe lowest point of the entire expansion is probably the story. It's not bad - it's just not Heavensward level of epic. Heavensward had me logging in to continue main story with almost religious zeal. Characters were authentic, values rang true and the adventures were immersive (even if they dragged a bit towards the end). Stormblood's story is interesting, fun, the cast is diverse and there are some plot twists here and there but it feels somewhat uninspired. Still good, but not excellent.\\n\\nAdditional content, like raids, trials, and dungeons, are pretty great. They are masterfully done and differ amongst themselves enough to keep you interested. While they follow pretty much the same script as before, they offer aesthetic variety and different mechanics so I was never really bored. To be fair, I think this is the part that has improved the most since ARR and I am happy devs are just getting better and better at it.\\n\\nThe community has always been one of the reasons I kept playing for years. People are just nice and toxicity is limited. That said, with the game becoming a bit more popular, this has changed slightly with SB. It's still miles ahead of WoW though, so if you want to find friends online to do cool stuff with, this is definitely your game.\\n\\nFinally, I'm not a big fan of the most recent additions and changes to the game. Eureka especially feels dull. Luckily, there are so many other things to do this is really not a problem.\\n\\nCan't say much about PvP b/c I never really had time to try it ^^.\",\n",

To all the people who says “it gets better” seriously, what is wrong with you? This constant insincerity is what kept me going. IT DOESN’T GET BETTER (a least to the point it serves as a valid argument).\\n\\nI just finished Shadowbringers 5.5 MSQ, and let me tell you, this is an “interactive Novel” more than it is a video game.\\n\\nSure with each expansion the game (novel) gets a little better, in terms of graphics, animations, storytelling, but the CORE of the game doesn’t change, it is still this outdated mmorpg tab targeting, with its main FOCUS on MSQ, which is basically walls of text.\\n\\nYour quests in order of occurrences is: talk, travel, click objects, kill NPCs, do dungeons/trials/story instances.\\nThey added one different mechanic in Stormblood lol, which is to “click stuff in FPS mode”.\\n\\nI can count the EPIC moments of the story in one hand! 3 of them were in Havensward and 2 in Shadowbringers (forget RR and SB).\\n\\nThe main focus of this game is the MSQ, but the problem is; the MSQ is 90% fluff pointless writing and storytelling, you could cut out 80% of this writing and still get a concise accurate description of the story, albeit just more on point.\\n\\nWhat Square Enix is doing is inflating game time content with more and more text and sloppy animation screens, which I’m not kidding stretches the MSQ than it really needs to be. I’m not even talking about important background build up, I’m talking about content you won’t even remember because it served no purpose in the grand scheme of things. (Anything you wont remember a month from now isn't worth reading about).\\n\\nBecause the MSQ is mainly storytelling, and single player orientated, why not just play better solo video games that are much, much better technically advanced in gameplay, like GTA 5, Witcher 3, red redemption 2, and hundreds of others titles?\\n\\nThere were times I was so desperate to just “play” the game, because there is so few dungeons/trials and killing quests in-between all the walls of text.\\n\\nOne could always pay a story skip potion, but the fact is MSQ is the focus of this game, the endgame is extra stuff. Players and Square have both said that MSQ is the focus of the game, and the more casual player base.\\n\\nWoW = focuses on repeatable endgame content after a short introductory (and often crap) storyline.\\n\\nFF14 = 200 hours of MSQ (at minimum)  at which point you can cycle through some endgame content and get max ilvl gear fairly easily. But levelling others job/crafts, which has its own questlines seems be one of the most popular things to do.\\n\\nI won’t be buying Endwalker. People who enjoy reading fluff for hundreds of hours to see one good cutscene here and there, you do that, enjoy! I’ll watch it in a recap YouTube video and do more productive things with my life than read FLUFF MSQ content, which is intentionally used to extend game play time.\\n\\n“You can always make more money, but you can’t make more time” think about if you’re really enjoying that 200 hours or if you’re only enjoy small amounts of it. Whilst the epic moments were epic, the pain of going through so much unfun content to see it was not worth it. The balance is definitely not there.\\n\\nEven most fans think the post RR quests are so bad, yet square hasnt fixed it by just removing it for new players by using a short narration cutscene to bring players up to date for havensward. (And i heard it was even worse, oh dear God).\",\n",
       " \"Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood was an ambitious tale of freedom, liberation, and what it means to stretch one's self too thin... which was, unfortunately, the major drawback to what could have been a great narrative. Mind, the overall experience was enjoyable, but the pacing and tonal issues hold it back severely. The characters were well written as per usual, but Lyse's development might be a tad rushed and sudden at times. The dungeons in this expansion range from awe-inspiring to rather average for the game's standard, while the trials in this game I must admit were all simply amazing. Not to mention, most of the new zones were fun to traverse and explore due to them taking place in locales only previously mentioned in passing.\\n\\nOverall, Stormblood is a good expansion, just not as great as what came before and what is to come after due to being held back by narrative and character development pacing issues.\",\n",
       " \"A hidden masterpiece that (un)fortunately didn't received all the attention it deserved due to being overshadowed by Undertale (don't get me wrong, UT is a masterpiece too) in it's period, but even today it's still a great game that I highly recommend to play especially if you are into games with a meta narrative like I do, because this game has freaking NAILED this type of narrative.\\nNow, I don't want to go too much in detail because I'm lazy and I don't want to heavily spoiler the game, so I'll sum up with pros and cons (yes, this game has cons, of course).\\n\\nPros:\\n-Niko (The Not Cat), the main protagonist, is one of the most likeable characters I've ever seen in a videogame (and it's really cute, too);\\n-Great soundtracks, maybe a little bit too short especially for some parts of the game, but still really nice to listen while doing puzzles and following the story;\\n-Graphics simple but gorgeous with really good drawn cut-scenes;\\n-Slow pace but since it's an entertaining puzzle-story driven game it's perfectly fine to play;\\n-Game mechanics are fun to play with, especially the item one which you've to combine items in order to progress or equip a specific item to unlock new dialogues and interactions;\\n-Unique and mind-blowing 4th wall breaks I never saw in a videogame before (not even Undertale) that perfectly goes along with the story;\\n-Perfectly done environments that clearly shows you how the world is really decaying, combined with the general melancholic tune the soundtracks have;\\n-Nice looking npcs and main characters in general;\\n-Challenging and interesting puzzles, not too easy and stupid but not too difficult either;\\n-Well designed and big but not dispersive maps. Everything will connect at some point;\\n-Addicting (emotionally too if you're that type of player like me), interesting and detailed story that not only uses the 4th wall break mechanic to it's finest, but it immerse YOU, The Player, to the point you're just the second protagonist alongside with Niko. In the end you'll probably cry.\\n\\nThese are all the pros I can recall now.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Limited and tile by tile only movement, both respectively meaning that you can't walk diagonally if not by doing a zig-zag type of movement (which it could be quite annoying at times because some parts of the game require you to move diagonally) and pressing a movement key even for a split second will result in Niko moving from a whole tile to another one, so no precise movements. All of this can sometimes give the feel that there's input lag;\\n-Even tho it's explained a little bit why later in the game, it's quite sad that we can't get to know more about most of the characters;\\n-A map. A FREAKING MAP PLEASE. Not necessarily a minimap like those in GTA and similar games who tells you everything, but at least one that when you discover a place that you can't interact with yet because you miss an item, it marks that place for you so you can come back easily and not get lost when you obtain that missing item. I managed to loose an hour in The Barrens in my first run because of this. I know there's fast travel but still a map assistant wouldn't hurt the game experience;\\n-The photography puzzle is too subject-specific IMHO, like if you don't know at least the basics of that subject (which is totally possible, I don't know anything about photography) you would end up searching on Internet for a solution.\\n\\nAnd these instead are all the cons I can remember, which even if there are a few, they don't hurt the experience that much and are forgivable.\\n\\nIn the end, should I suggest this game?

Then, it somehow tops that as well.\\n- Practically half of what makes this game amazing, is it's wonderful retro/indie soundtrack.

If you liked Undertale, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try.\\n\\nMy one complaint is about the gameplay. In order to progress, you need to collect items scattered throughout each area, so if you miss one it can be a pain in the butt to repeatedly scour the land to find it.

They definitely have not pushed any boundaries there.\\nNext, the camera. I\\'m tired of fighting it. It\\'s OP. During the first boss battle there were multiple times where the target selected icon came off the boss randomly and the camera lost its bearings. At one point while standing on a scaffolding with a enemy beneath me I started to spin fast. The enemy below me was doing a spin to win attack and here is me above him spinning in place . WTF\\nLastly, the game doesn\\'t feel new enough or different enough to me. Lots of the same weapons and shields from DS2, lots of the same Miracles from DS2. There is just too much of it that feels recycled from  DS2 and Bloodborne. I told my wife about the game and how excited for it that I was and she asked yesterday \"Did you get your new game?\" I said \"Yeah hun, I\\'m playing it right now\".

First off I'm coming directly from Bloodborne, which I beat four times/loved, and haven't played any of the previous Souls games, so I'm going to be biased - for anyone else coming straight from Bloodborne, beware!\\n\\nI just don't like the feel of the combat mechanics in Dark Souls 3. Bloodborne was lightning fast, free-flowing, elegant, extremely responsive, almost Street Fighter level controls, combos and counters. Dark Souls feels like you're moving through molasses, fighting the controls (and camera) every step of the way. In Bloodborne with some finesse and dodging you can take on a room full of enemies, In Dark Souls you have to pull one at a time, even 2-3 guys is generally being cornered/death. Bloodborne encourages lightning-fast reaction times and pushing forward with aggression when you're wounded, Dark Souls rewards a slow, heavy armor, plodding, hiding behind a shield/turtling style.\\n\\nLastly the art style - Bloodborne was an incredibly rich, detailed, nuanced, eerie, Lovecraftian nightmare, while Dark Souls seems to embrace this generic Lord of the Rings/Game of Thrones type fantasy environment with an undead vibe. Crumbling towers, dungeons, dragons, evil forest, swamps, check, check. I'm just not digging the art style, and it feels like a huge step backwards from Bloodborne quality and detail-wise.\\n\\nI gave up and returned the game after about 15 hours and 6-7 bosses. I just can't hack it, it's just not that fun. Every death in Bloodborne felt like it was teaching me patterns and making me improve - every death in this game feels annoying because you were fighting the controls instead of the boss.\\n\\nSorry guys! I know I'm a dissenting opinion in a wall of perfect 10 reviews here and everyone seems to just love it, but I'm not just not feeling it. Here's to hoping Bloodborne 2 is being developed next!\",\n",
       " \"Not worth all of the praise it receives.  Any other game series would be ridiculed for putting out the same exact game over and over I don't see why this game isn't.  It is the SAME EXACT game as all the other Souls games.  Assassin's Creed games are more different from each other than the differences between the Souls games.  Demon Souls and Bloodborne were the only titles that were new and different.  Go play Dark Souls if you want to play all three Dark Souls games because when you have played one you have essentially played all three.\",\n",

The best thing about it, probably, is that it is not Dark Souls 2.  It hearkens back to Dark Souls but maintains series classics like impossible-to-follow \"quests,\" the killing of several primary bosses to advance, poison swamp levels and brutal gameplay.

While it's still pretty good Souls material, it has it's moments and I really enjoyed my playthroughs, I must say, this has been my least favourite entry in the series.\\n\\nIt lacks it's own unique flavor, most places you visit, you feel like you've been there before, most NPC's you meet you feel like you've met before, most items and weapons are straight up copy-paste from previous games, it just feels like playing the same thing all over again, I appreciate the nostalgic tidbits here and there, but this went a little bit too far, whole experience felt too repetitive, like all previous Souls titles mixed together without creating it's own unique identity.\\n\\nIt's still an amazing game that's worth playing through at least once, but the thing is, Demon Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne were true masterpieces, even Dark Souls 2 while it had some problems, I enjoyed it more, mainly for it's amazing multiplayer/pvp/covenants, which is another area where DS3 is seriously lacking. The fact that it's probably the most linear of all Souls games doesn't help either and severely hurts replayability.\\n\\nTo end the review on a praising the sun note, world design is again top notch here, very complex especially in it's verticality, some areas such as Irithyll are just beautiful, gameplay is still fun, bosses that stand out this time for me were Abyss Watchers, Dancer or Nameless King. Some of the lore elements were very interesting, entire questline with Yuria and lord of hollows, mysteries around Londor or children of Gwynevere, very good stuff and it made me go back for some more digging, so as I said, still a great game and a suiting end to the franchise, but...\\n\\nI hope this was truly the last Souls title and I'm looking forward to see something really new from From Soft next time, because the talent is absolutely still there, they just need to focus on new ideas instead of rehashing the old ones. 8/10\",\n",

This allows people to actually get better at the game, but without merely getting better \"weapons and armor\" (Ex. Destiny) Game was good length as well. Soundtrack was extremely well produced and adds a lot of intensity to boss fights. Only negative things I found was that a lot of the locations look the same (have the grey pallet) and can get boring. There are a few exceptions, but the majority are boring and dull, due to the same color pallet, which consists of mostly shades.

If you enjoyed the first one, you will also with this.\\nI loved how they like to tell the stories/lore here, they don't just thorw in your face for you to watch and listen, you need to go for it and put the pieces together. They did put a bunch of explanations about bosses, group of people and npc's stories in the description of their itens, like in armors or spells that when you gather you have a piece of the lore. They also did this with talking with npc's wich are pretty much all optional, so you really need to go after it if you want to understand.\\nThey did added phases and powers for various weapons, very much like bloodborne, they have different abillities that could be with lightining, sorcery and others, you can use those pressing L2 and gonna consume your blue bar, wich was another addiction, that maked sense, then you can't use thoose powers all the time and get to overpower. Another adding was the bosses different phases, when you get their life to the half, most of them does transform or start using different type of powers, that's great, because it gives to the battle more diversity and makes you change your move set.\\nThe places are all formidable, the universe building is fantastic, you can see that they did have fondness to do it, are all pretty different, one place to another, the enemies change, the places still all connected and you will always be finding shortcuts, is beautiful how they did it once again. there is one specific place that if you played the others, i swear that you gonna feel a nostalgia in a great way, how they did reconstructed the place but now destroyed, damn, when you see that coming is just fantastic, it's perfect.\\nAnother thing that we have in here, is that are a bunch of optional places with bosses to go, places that for you to go, is needed to pay attention in what you have and what the place say to you, kind like the doll in the first one.\\nTo not say that i didn't say one bad thing about the movie, they did removed the cut the tail, before you always caught some weapon doing this, in this one, for some reason, the took it off, and personally, i tough that was pretty cool.\\nIt was improved the online even more, now we have the possibility to put keys in our games, and then when the friend put the sign on the ground it will automatically show to the other person, and then you will be able to play, this is great. They did put one place that even after you kill the boss of the area you are still able to be invaded and summon people, for pvp, this is another great idea that they did had, because now you don't have to start a new journey, if you don't want to, to play pvp.\\nThe gameplay is pretty much just like the first one, not fast as bloodborne, but it works, you can get used to easily.\\nThe customization for faces and stuff like that still simple, but inside the world is fantastic, there is a numerous quantity of armours, and here, different than the others, it doesn't make a lot of difference once that you are using something, wich is great, because then when you go online, each person is different, is using some different armour, different than the first one when everybody used that giant stuff, in dark souls 3 you will use the one that is more stylish for you.\\nSo basically the game is insanely great, you will have fun, difficulty and will be entretained for a bunch of hours.

When fans say this is \"the sequel we deserve\", they mostly mean it in this way.\\n- The music. By far my personal favorite soundtrack in the series, and that includes Bloodborne.\\n- The design of the world and the bosses are an improvement over DS2.\\n- The option to return to the game after beating the story instead of automatically starting over. DS2 shared the same feature.\\n- Introduction of \"Ashen Flasks\" for your Focus Points (magic)\\n\\nCONS:\\n- It\\'s very linear, even more than it was in DS2.\\n- Glitches. Poor framerate in some spots are understandable, but since when does a Souls game have bugs?\\n- Enemy AI is often broken, and their tracking of your movements are all over the place.\\n- I can upgrade weapons and shields, but not armor?\\n- Not as long or as deep as the other two Dark Souls games, it will take the average Souls vet no more than 40-45 hours to explore everything and beat every boss. In the other two it took around 60-70.\\n\\nOverall a little disappointed as a fan of the series, but it was still a decent game in general.

As soon as you step into this world you can see the time and effort that the developers had put into this game from just how beautiful all the surroundings are. I have not doubt in giving this game 10/10',\n",
       " \"Just started playing this last night, already clocked 9 hours, the graphics are stunning, combat is fluid and the music and voice acting IS PHENOMENAL. I love dark souls so much and if this truly is the final dark souls game, itll be a sad day for us all. But bittersweet, because we're sent off with a final stunning entry in this amazing series. Thank you FromSoftware.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s a Souls game. That\\'s both it\\'s strength and it\\'s weakness.\\nIt\\'s strength because DkS3 does basically everything better than its predecessors.\\nIt\\'s weakness, because it doesn\\'t really do anything new. Nothing in the game really managed to surprise or amaze me.\\nIt\\' s still a good game, just not \"great\" or \"amazing\".',\n",
       " \"This is not only my game of 2016, but the best game I've played for a long time!\\n\\nI bought the game rather tentatively, having never played a Souls game, the challenging nature tempted me but I perceived the game as a medieval fantasy which would not normally interest me. Having now completed the game, I am so glad I tried it, it was incredible all the way through! I would not define the game as a medieval fantasy but instead as a Gothic Underworld masterpiece.\\n\\nThe Gothic atmosphere and setting is one of the greatest and lasting aspects of the game. I no longer look at a cathedral or church in the same way, I am expecting there to be skeleton dogs and undead creatures around every corner.\\n\\nThe tension in the game is immense, when you get past a tough enemy and enter a new area low on estus with lots of souls you tread very carefully in search of that next glorious bonfire. I loved that tension!\\n\\nThe boss fights are to be feared and embraced! Most of the bosses and incredibly cool and well designed, the battles really reward a patient and calm playstyle, to get past many of the bosses you must first understand the boss before you can pass. Whilst bosses can certainly be frustrating, the reward for defeating them is euphoria!\\n\\nIt is worth saying that the story and the lore of DS3 is never clear. This is far from a negative strangely but one of its strongest aspects of the game! The description with each new item, weapon or boss soul contains an extra piece of the jigsaw into the plot, the history and the myth! The jigsaw feels huge and every piece unravels just a little more, it becomes more of a search to unlock the mysteries of this land!\\n\\nI found myself enjoying this game in unique ways, it is the only game I have ever supplemented with watching a Let's Play on YouTube. When you defeat a tough boss or area, there is nothing more satisfying to re-live it by watching somebody else struggle. I also have watched videos detailing the lore behind the game and still there is so much mystery you can lose yourself in it.\\n\\nWhat makes this game so great is the depth behind the lore, the bosses, the items and the setting. It has created one of the coolest and richest worlds full of myths, mysteries, awe and dread.\\n\\nFrom Software. My Thanks!\",\n",
       " \"Dark Souls 1 would be my favorite out of the 3 but unfortunately because of the horrible frame rate and other minor issues, I cannot give it that spot as my favorite. Dark Souls 3 however is so polished and improved from the 1st game in Music, Graphics, Bosses, Combat and level design that this really is a no brainer why this game is considered one of the best RPGs of all time.\\n\\nThis is one of the reasons why other RPGs need to step up their game to get onto From Software's level in terms of combat. I didn't think anything could even get on par with Bloodborne's combat but Dark Souls 3 does and still to this day there is not a game that has surpassed these 2 games.\\n\\nThe music for me is what has improved from the past games and it shows with the boss music. The Abyss Watchers and Final boss music are up there with my best in the series. The way the music transitions to the original boss music is the best and is a great way to look back at how far From Software has come and how far you have improved since the first.\\n\\nOnce again, there are so many moments and experiences you will only get from playing a Dark Souls game and that's what makes the game so great. Watching videos or playing for a few hours won't be enough, you have to play and experience the whole game for yourself.\\n\\nThis is easily one of my favorite games of all time and I don't see many games topping this from years to come. A must play for fans of the RPG Genre.\",\n",
       " \"This is very much so a high quality game.  Good graphics, great textures, and amazing style.   I love dark souls so much and if this truly is the final dark souls game, itll be a sad day for us all. But bittersweet, because we're sent off with a final stunning entry in this amazing series. Thank you FromSoftware.\",\n",
       " \"Let me start off by saying, I love the Dark Souls series, and I have thoroughly enjoyed Dark Souls 3. However, this game has disappointed me in more ways than I can count, and honestly, I am extremely angry at From Software for their obvious laziness in creating this game. Let's start out with what is absolutely amazing about this game. First off, the weapons skill system. The new skill system that has been implemented in Dark Souls 3 is a ton of fun and a great addition to the game. It gives weapons a whole new purpose and can completely change the way you fight.\\nThe new enemies that have been added to the game are also very interesting with some terrifying or just plain strange enemy design similar to bloodborne. On top of that, each enemy you encounter has a very unique AI and skill set that will definitely test your limits, without feeling unfair.\\nThis game took a lot of points from Dark Souls 1 and made a map that was interconnected in various ways, with plenty of side areas you can go and explore for fun. On top of that each side area has plenty of extra loot for you to find, so it is always worth exploring everywhere you possibly can. Add in that these various areas are extremely well made with beautiful and epic visuals, and you have one of the, if not the, best made maps in all of the Dark Souls series.\\nThe upgrading system has also been updated as well. Now, it is always beneficial for you to infuse your weapons, along with the fact that many new infusions have been added into the game like heavy, sharp, refined, and deep. It is also no longer very hard to find the titanite to upgrade your weapons like the other games in the series. Often, you can farm enemies for almost every single kind of titanite in the game, and can collect more than enough each NG to fully upgrade up to eight weapons.\\nNow..... it is time for me to tell you all why this game is such a HUGE let down. It seems that literally none of the issues that plagued this game series ever since its inception have been fixed. The camera angles are just as bad, if not worse than Dark Souls 1. Especially when you get into any kind of small room, or fight a big boss or monster, you will often find you cannot see a single damn thing because your camera is stuck in some wall or pillar.\\nThey also have not fixed the issue of hitboxes in  this game. You will often find yourself being hit by attacks that are very obviously not even close to your actual character. This is especially prevalent in PVP where this issue is compounded by another huge issue in this series which is PVP lag. You will often find your attacks simply do not hit players, or they will suddenly teleport a couple feet every few seconds, or that you will suddenly be backstabbed by a person who literally seemed to teleport behind you. Mix that with the absolutely atrocious hitboxes in this game, and you are just asking for extreme amounts of rage.\\nTalking about PVP, I seriously want to ask From Software if they have ever heard of the word 'unbalanced'. This game's PVP system is probably the most broken I have seen in the entire series of Souls games. There are a few weapons and build sets that you can get in the game that will make you able to easily 1 hit kill/1 inescapable combo kill literally anyone, whereas other weapons are like pea shooters in comparison. Add in that there are multiple weapons that have a vastly better moveset than other weapons to the point where it is just completely unfair, and you have DS3 PVP. A good example of this would be the Farron Greatsword and dagger combo weapon versus the Dark Sword. The Dark Sword is a small sword, and should therefore be able to hit much faster than the Greatsword and dagger combo correct? Nope, in this game the greatsword has multiple attacks that are light years faster than the Dark Sword, as well as large sweeping attacks that can take away your entire stamina bar by blocking just once. On top of all of that, the Greatsword and dagger combo weapon also has multiple moves that give them unassailable poise even if they are wearing light armor.\\nI am greatly disappointed in this game because of the fact these game breaking issues have still been made into this game and have even been generally accepted by the community. I personally think it is absolutely ridiculous that a big game developer like From Software would release a game with this many glitches and huge issues that have been apparent since the first game. And I assure you, they will never fix any of these issues in any patch so I can rest assured knowing my score on this game won't change. I genuinely enjoy the game and I think it is a great finale to the series, however I cannot get over these huge glaring issues.\",\n",
       " 'Dark Souls 3 is a fitting end to the series with many throwbacks, and superb gameplay systems.\\n\\nGameplay\\n\\nThe Combat mechanics are what you would expect from a Souls game, only slightly refined, and the addition of weapon arts is a fun new wrinkle that adds depth to each of the weapons. The exploration is one of the highlights of any From game, and DS3 is no exception. peaking around a corner only to find a rare piece of equipment, or perhaps a Titanite source is always a reviling moment. Or perhaps fighting through tough enemies to reach a drop that benefits you greatly. The sense of scope is also back, with paths that connect, and being able to look down upon a path you just traveled through hours before is satisfying.\\n\\nStory\\n\\nThe lore is as always obtuse, and cryptic, however it is there if you chose to look, and listen. The game is not to hard to grasp but the further you poke your nose the more engrossed you become with the world. Also for souls veterans such as myself there are many callbacks to the original DS that will make any fan happy, and surprised.\\n\\nPresentation\\n\\nThe Graphics are nice, and while it wont blow you away, the different locales, and the variety of environments makes it so you never get bored. For the most part the game ran smooth on PS4, but there were some moments of frame-rate dips, and slowdowns in certain areas/fights.\\n\\nOverall Dark Souls 3 is an excellent send off to the series, and one that seems like a love letter to fans once the credits roll, and any souls fans will enjoy the ride till the fire fades.',\n",
       " \"Dark Souls 3 encapsulates  the essence of both dark souls  and bloodborne in a way that feels almost seamlessly fluid. The environment in Dark Souls 3 is a blatant mixture of both games in a commonly not so subtle way. The undead settlement and most of the early game locations has a very strong bloodborne feel, while the later locations in the game give off the same tone as the first dark souls game.The combat allows for the use of shields once more, yet shields still hold less power than they did in dark souls and maintains the strategy of dodging first blocking second that bloodborne incorporated. Many early game weapons are versatile enough to be able to be used until very late game content, like the long sword for example. Bosses in dark souls 3 are no less brutal than it's predecessors either. Right off the bat, you are thrust into an intense fight with a large knight, and then when you think you've figured him out, he transforms into another monster entirely and forces the player to change their tactics and rethink their strategy. This is a theme that is held all the way through the game and forces the player to become a quick thinker or be punished. And that is the beauty of the game. A game that forces the player to get better without any handicaps to help you succeed is exactly what the souls series has thrives off of for years and this is no different. Sadly, now that dark souls has successfully made it to the mainstream more and more people are playing, which means there are more casual gamers that will give the game a bad name and call it unfair even though it's just them not understanding the concept of the game, and also drive away many of the experienced souls veterans who partially love the game because of it's exclusivity.\\nIn a completely unbiased review, Dark Souls 3 is near perfect for souls standards but doesn't' deserve a 10 because it doesn't just borrow from it's previous titles, but straight up steals from it by literally recreating areas from previous games and npc's as well, and although this is cool for nostalgia, it is also very uncreative. Along with that, some of the level design is questionable. That being said, besides recreated levels and some questionable level design choices, dark souls 3 has reminded me the scope of the original, while also maintaining some modern flair\",\n",
       " \"This game is entirely about diving at the right times to avoid your opponent’s auto-targeting, or avoiding colossal monsters’ attacks, which penetrate walls somehow. While it has its moments, between incredible settings, and epic boss fights, the combat in general is busted. There is no other way to explain the insane precision of the regular A.I, who can pivot a hundred and eighty degrees in a fraction of a second while still attacking you somehow. In boss fight, or fights against larger monsters especially, and in fights with monsters in general, you will certainly die more than once being struck through a wall. You'll also die falling off of ledges because your character has to leap forward to attack, and half of the fights take place on some tight rope a half-mile above the earth for some reason. Enjoy playing the same 100 meter stretch of gameplay for a whole day, dying in inexplicable ways, and holding in your tears of shame and rage while trying to justify having spent $90 on a rage-induced brain tumour.\",\n",
       " \"What is there to say? - actually there are so many things to say but most importantly this is Dark Souls through and through with the loveliness of the Bloodborne engine.\\n\\nJust to get a few technical details out of the way; there are a few (but VERY few!) minor grumbles such as occasional frame skipping and of course the occasional graphical lag (though this occurs a LOT less than Bloodborne). However, this is offset by the fantastic game play and surprisingly pleasant loading times (similar to Bloodborne post patch). It is also very light with a 19.4 GB install size as of patch 1.03 on the PS4.\\n\\nWeapon arts are great for the most part and add a lot of flavour to the game play (as well as fashion souls in some cases, particularly the long-sword stance) but thankfully aren't essential and as far as I am into the game , I'd say if you are not too keen on the idea you can play without them.. but they are fun!\\n\\nOne thing that has struck me is the difference between the starting classes, you really do feel like you play your class, more so than the other Dark Souls games, however this may be as I am coming from hours upon hours of Bloodborne where each starting story was just that - a back story for your character.\\n\\nSo be you on the PS4, Xbox One or PC, if you love Dark Souls or Bloodborne - get it!\\n\\nIf you are unsure if you should buy it or not - get it!\\n\\n11 out of 10 :D\",\n",

This was the one of the most linear games i have ever played.. i feel like i shouldn't always know where to go, especially in Dark Souls. Early game was kinda boring but it picked up.

       " 'Let me start off by saying Ive been a souls fan from the beginning and have put hundreds of hours into the series. Ive loved it all from.the beginning, but this is the first game in the series Ive been reluctant towards playing to the end. 20 hours in and I am just completely bored of it, I dont know if its because  theres been 3 souls games over 3 years, Im including Bloodborne. To me this feels lile the most rushed and lazily designed of the batch with the biggest marketing campaign. I feel most of the hype surrounding is how accessible this one is, souls games are known to be challenging but fair where you learn from errors, learn placement and new.strategies constantly. Dks3 features none of this, at least for a series vet, everything is rehashed. Ive run through 20 hours hardly ever dying or being stumped, bloodborne at least challenged me every step of the way. Then theres the level design, its the same huge disappointment as dks2 being very linear with very little aside for exploration. Although Um being quite negative the game isnt bad, its ok. I actually enjoy the amped up speed of combat. The art direction is phenomenal and imposing as well as the soundtrack. Aesthetically its the best in the series in my opinion. I just really hate seeing one of my favorite series go out with such little flair and follow more of the same from dks2 mainling rather than following what was phenomenal in demon souls and dark souls 1 while adding more new improvements. Im probably going to get down voted for this review also, but it is my honest opinion, Im very disappointed.',\n",
       " 'I tend to agree: Ds3 loadings ARE bad.\\nThough I felt in love with this game, it\\'s undeniable that no \"souls\" game before it had been so hampered by slow load times.\\nSlow loadings ruins replayability; hence they should be fixed.',\n",
       " \"If Metacritic could represent decimals in their scoring system, my review would show as an 8.5/10. This game really does a lot of things right, and it is probably fair to say that it is the penultimate Dark Souls experience.\\n\\nDark Souls 3 succeeds in providing players with the challenging gameplay that Dark Souls fans have come to love. The world of Dark Souls 3 is by far the most immersive and visually impressive world that has come out of the developers of the Souls/Bloodborne games. The cliché praise of graphics (matched only by the cliché claim that graphics don't matter) in this case truly alters the gaming experience. With the winning combination of perfected world design and demanding gameplay, you will not be in want of escapism with this game.\\n\\nThat being said, there are several things holding this game back from a 10/10, or even a 9/10. Among these drawbacks includes the somewhat underwhelming bosses. Some bosses in this game are really underperforming.\\n\\nAnother criticism: with all the new mechanics available to the developers, it would have been nice to see them try something new. To be sure, the Dark Souls series operates on a very successful and gratifying-to-play formula. But it is, undoubtedly, the same formula put on display in all three Dark Souls games. This can bring with it an additional annoyance, considering especially the sometimes cheap deaths that seem to be more of an easy-way-out-design than a genuine challenge.\\n\\nNonetheless, at the end of the day this game is definitely one of the more worthwhile experiences that can be found on the new console.\",\n",
       " \"Dark Souls 3 is a game that ranges from epic and impressive to a bit disappointing.  Most of the time the experience is positive.  But the Souls formula is starting to show its age, and as the series finale DS3 is stymied by the familiarity of many aspects.  Writing as a hardcore fan of the series, I found the flaws were not enough to hold the game back, but they are often right upfront and center.\\n\\nFor brevity's sake, I'll list the main factors: the framerate is often deplorable, glitches are occasional and sometimes frustrating.  If you've played the other games, you may not like how many things in this game you've seen before.  The level design is not the series' peak but sometimes approaches it.

       " \"I have never player a dark souls game before this one, i just saw some videos and heard that it was onde of the hardest games in market. I always loved RPG's/action adventure games, but there was something in dark souls games that didn't attracted me but i didn't know what. But still i tried to give this game a shot, and know what? I have 0 regrets, because it is a great game that we have here.\\n\\nNow in this review i will not compare this game with previous ones, but i will give a genuine review for someone that is new to the series. I must also say that i played the game completely offline since i have no ps plus subscription. I will divide this review based on what i liked and didn't like in this game.\\nSo what parts of dark souls 3 i really liked??\\n\\n-Difficulty: Before starting the game i thought that people exagerated regarding the difficulty in this game, for someone who beated witcher 3 in max difficulty this game will be a piece of cake i thought..........how wrong i was xD. The first 10 hours were sooooo hard for me, the first boss in the tutorial area i think that i died at least 10 times, in the wall of lothric i really suffered at the hand of those bastard knights. I died...again...and again, until the 3rd or 4th boss the game was being really frustrating for me. BUT as soon as i started getting used to the enemies and the game mechanics is started really enjoying this game, i still died a lot of times in boss battles but now instead of getting frustrated i tried to learn the enemies mechanics...and the feeling that i had when i finaly won a boss fight is nothing that i ever experienced in another game. If this game was easy i am sure that the score would at least fall to 7.\\n\\n-Combat: skill matters in this game, you can have the best armour and weapons in this game but the trashiest enemies can still **** you up. You can never underestimate an enemy in dark souls 3, and i always fight in maximum against 2/3 enemies at a time. The weapon skills were pretty nice too. And the boss design was outstanding, i had so much fun (and headaches xD) fighting them.\\n\\n-Lore: the lore in this game is hidden in every item that you find in dark souls 3, and how great it is, it was something that i was not expecting in this kind of game. By paying attention of the world that surrounded me i could learn a lot about each location, that was covered in mystery.\\n\\n-Character creation: I know that in most of times your character is hidden behind a helmet, but still the character creator sure impressed me, especially the tattoos!\\n\\n-Leveling system: The idea of becoming stronger has you obtain more souls from your dead enemies is pretty nice. There are also a lot of different attributes regarding your character so you can make a lot of builds! In my playthrough i played as a mercenary, wielding a curved swords and a medium shield, but in my next playthrough i am thinking in playing as a herald, who uses various miracles (a type of magic in this game) and has a nice spear!\\n\\n-Art/Graphics: the representation of a world after the apocalypse is very cool, the churches, the castles, the views, everything is very good looking. The graphics are outstanding too.\\n\\nNow what i did not like so much in this game:\\n\\nStory: Now don't get me wrong, the lore is amazing but i think that there is a really waste of potencial in this game regarding the story. I believe that if the game had more cutscenes, with more interesting characters, i believe that the experience would be better. I would like to see more npc's with different and depth backstories, the ones you find i think that they are very bland.\\n\\nDepressing ending:(SPOILERS) In my ending i linked the first flame, but the flame was already very weak so all my fights during the game were futile, so much sacrifice for in the end the world fall in the age of the dark (which is not necessarily bad, it depends on each person interpretation), you completed your mission that was to link the flame....but in the end it was all in vain. Now don't get me wrong, there is beauty in this ending, but i would like a more shining ending after all the battles that we had. And basically this ending is a 30 second cutscene which is a bit of a letdown.\\n\\nOverall:  A great experience, i have never played a game of this kind, it is very different from normal action-rpg's. Before starting my next playthrough i am viewing youtube videos about the lore in this game, because there were quite some things that i missed and didn't understand in my 1st playthrough.\\nSo i am really excited to do again a new journey with a different character/build and this time i will be more alerted to the world that surrounds me in dark sous 3 :).\\n\\nEDIT: I am updating my review to give it a 8.5~9. My second playthrough was even more rewarding, i learned more secrets about this world that escape me the first time. The best thing of this game is that you are never bored while playing it.\",\n",
       " \"Having played the first two games and their respective DLC's, I come here with some scepticism as to how this story would fit in.  The standard's were very high, expectations to the roof.\\nWhere the first, I personally felt, lacked a bit in combat, this game give it to the fullest. Where the second lacked in meaningful NPC's and stories, this one has a plenty. From the most common merchant, to the secret boss, everything is thought out and planned in classical Dark Souls fashion. The gameplay is familiar enough to scare you exploring, but inviting just a bit, to make you want to test different play styles.\\nIt's an adventure that packs 60 hours of gameplay in your first try, maybe even more if you dare go far off the beaten path. And speaking of such a path, maybe it's only downfall is the linear story towards the end. For Souls fans who always sough the mystery of where to go next (I myself have spent hours on youtube figuring that out) It is a bit of a disappointment.\\n\\nThe bosses in this game are the most diverse in the entire Souls franchise. Big, scary, fast, unforgiving, there is a favourite boss for everybody. I might go as far as to say that there is one boss that gives Artorias, and OnS a run for their gold coin.\\n\\nIn the end, Dark Souls III answers many lore questions, but raises quite a few knew ones.

       " \"Pros: Amazing graphics, Immersive experience, Beautifully crafted weapons and armor. Great integrated pvp and pve system, Bosses that won’t let you give up until you slaughter them.\\n\\nCons: Will be VERY difficult for beginners new to the Dark Souls franchise, endgame is PVP, a few bugs and glitches every here and there.\\n\\nDark souls 3 is hands down FromSofts  best creation in the souls series stretching all the way from 2009’s Demon Souls. So first things first this game is $60 and I think this is a fair price because of all the content that comes with the game and that will be coming for the DLC (Downloadable Content) . As soon as you step into the world of this game you’ll be able to make a character of your choosing such as attributes,what class,starting items, and what you look like. After that the tale begins of the Ashen One's journey to link the flame. You start off very simply until you journey to the next area where all the detail and hard work from the last 2 years has shone into this game. You can see the sun shining through the broken rocks and reflecting off the water.  After over 1000 hours of playing this game I still can’t get enough of how beautiful each and every area of this game is. And if people find this game is too difficult they can always play with their friends which has been a traditional feature in all the soul games, or if their feeling evil they can go invade someone else’s world and show them what dark souls really means.\\n\\nIf you're still not interested I have a lot left to convince you why this game is worth your time. The tutorial of this game in not easy and it’s not meant to be either, the game wants you to keep dying to the boss and the mobs to prepare you for what lies ahead in the world. Unfortunately this makes a lot of players quit the game and make them feel like they’ve been scammed only after they’ve been a few times. This game has so much value that people don’t discover because they just give up. When you do get past the first boss you start to tie into the main plot of the game and why you were chosen to link the first flame. Lotric which is the main city in the game has dungeons and enemies everywhere to make it a challenge. For the game, mechanics are very simple the game has messages lying around telling you what every button does. Now the cherry on the top of the game revolves around the bosses I’m not gonna spoil anything because I want people to experience it for themselves.\\n\\nThe game also runs very well at a constant 60 frames per second everywhere you go.\\nI don’t have much else to say about this game without spoiling it. If you do decide to get this game you should keep going until the very end and try not to summon other players unless it get’s very difficult. Overall if you do keep keep this game in get discouraged because you keep failing you’ll never get the true value of this game which is the shining star.\",\n",

The other astounding game is of course Bloodborne.

I don\\'t suck and have plenty of videos to support my claims. With that out of the way (which shouldn\\'t be necessary, but you all know how the Souls community operates by now):\\n\\nI was initially head-over-heels in love with DS3. I found the world design, level design, and graphics to be breathtaking. However, by about my 4th play through on, after the initial glitz and glamor of the spectacular world had worn off, I found the combat/game play to be incredibly clunky and the pvp to be absolutely atrocious. It plays just like DS1, which is really not a good thing in 2016. It feels outdated and out of place in an otherwise gorgeous world and I\\'m willing to bet that the combat went retro because of all the DS1 whiners who failed to adapt to the new mechanics of DS2 and did nothing but **** about it. In DS3, they ruined the smooth and fluid step back, which was my bread and butter move in DS2 pvp, and all thrust attacks now have the same herky jerky, hiccuping, fishing pole cast type of animations that DS1 thrust attacks did. I loved DS1 once upon a time, but after 2000+ hours in DS2, over half of which was in pvp, it genuinely feels like **** to play. DS3 feels the same way DS1 did when I went back to it from time to time to take a break from DS2.\\n\\nDS3 is also ridiculously easy. I was already no damaging just under half the boss fights by my second play through, and with the challenge just about gone already, the subpar, clunky combat wasn\\'t enough to keep me interested. So what did I do? I spent some time with pvp and co-op and, my God, they are absolutely awful. Pvp sucks, first and foremost, because of the aforementioned clunky combat, but also because it is the laggiest pvp experience to date (and Souls games have always suffered from latency issues, but nothing like this). Co-op is even worse. In co-op, you can have 3 summons so that a grand total of 4 people beat on a boss like a freaking pinata with very little risk of dying to anyone in the party. It\\'s a joke. As an above average gamer, I love lending my expertise and mastery of a fight to people, but when I\\'m joined by three others it becomes a boring gank squad simulator where the only challenge comes from getting in each other\\'s way. At the same time, these 4 man teams are a nightmare for invaders, making that aspect of the pvp awful as well.\\n\\nAs of now, I\\'m already back to DS2 and loving it. It\\'s like being reacquainted with an old friend. I bought the SOTFS version for PS4 since I originally had the PS3 version (unfortunately my PS3 died on me back in January) and all feels right with the universe again. Smooth and fluid combat, much better looking female characters, co-op that\\'s actually fun, pvp that\\'s actually fun, and even better weapons (they ruined my Majestic GS in DS3). Nearly everyone I\\'ve talked to has agreed with me on most of these things, if not all, and I\\'m so disappointed with DS3 at the moment that I had to post this somewhere and figured it would be better received here than on the DS3 board. The one thing DS3 has going for it is the best world and level design in the series along with the best graphics. That\\'s it. 7/10 game, sadly, and this is coming from a Souls vet whose all time favorite games are the Souls games.\\n\\nPlease let me know if this contains any unacceptable spoilers and I\\'ll be happy to edit asap.

       " 'I\\'m not sure what to think about this game.  They copy the first Dark Souls boss by making him incredibly difficult.  That\\'s basically the hardest boss in the game since you can now level up, equip a decent weapon and team up with 2 more players to fight them.  This game is really good, but it suffers some pacing issues with boss difficulty.  Some of the bosses are pretty good, while others really go down with some simple movement.  One thing that\\'s great about this game is the major differences it has with previous games, but that could also be its major downfall.  I didn\\'t quite find a dungeon as satisfying as Sen\\'s fortress.  There also wasn\\'t a boss as amazing as  the wolf in the forest or Smaugh and the other guy.  Recycling the same gear game after game is not acceptable.  The majority of the armor and weapons are completely recycled.  Some of the new ones are really great, but I can\\'t help but notice they don\\'t have many new offerings to the world.  Some items are totally ruined by redesign like the ring of sacrifice.  Not being able to upgrade armor makes the armor pointless and even with the strongest armor in the game I was getting hit with ridiculous amounts of damage as I progressed.  I beat the final boss on the first try but took 5 tries to beat the first.  That first boss wasn\\'t very fun to fight either.  He also had more interesting phases so it felt like the game ran out of gas.  If you played Dark Souls 2 you\\'ll be dissapointed that there isn\\'t a treasure dragon cove like there is with that game.  There are many disturbing zombie areas with gross explosions out of bodies and just sickening horror, which wasn\\'t what I was looking for in this.  I always liked Mayasaki\\'s art style and surprisingly awesome fantasy world.  There are sections where this was done well though, however.  The dragons are much better designed and fit with the art style of the world in this than Dark Souls 2.  There are some pretty cool areas but it can be almost too city focused and not enough mountains and foresty areas like with the other games.  The dungeon here dungeon there gets old and repetitive.  The biggest letdown is the covenants are quite boring and don\\'t offer you any real good gear.  They nerfed weapons in the middle of the release which made some weapons completely suck right when the patch hit.  I\\'m thinking estoc, but I noticed I couldn\\'t get any real damage out of certain weapons and I couldn\\'t see why they weren\\'t doing much against some bosses even if I had it fully upgraded with 40 strength.  So the balanced rule has kind of killed the funfactor of the game and I didn\\'t feel as powerful as I usually do at the end of other Dark Souls games.  Utlimately the new engine is great, but the framerates at moments really slow you down but not the boss.  Delayed responses in dives and doubling your strike because the game lagged can be frustrating especially when this causes you to die or get hit really hard even though you posted your shield.  If you\\'re looking for a significantly better game, better buy a 3ds and stick to Monster Hunter 4.  When I dive, my guy dives, when I swing my weapon my weapon swings, no more no less.  Thanks Mayasaki, but kind of dissapointed and expected a little more.  The \"attempts\" to fix the game only killed the enjoyment of many items, depth of upgrading gear & the feeling of being powerful at the end, so overall I give this a 7.  Thanks for reading',\n",

       " 'Another fine example of human pettiness and stupidity...while Konami is busy bringing back \"legendary\" horse armor DLC and Warner Bros selling previously free Batgirl content for ten times it\\'s real value, CDPR releases something that blows away majority of other titles in amount AND quality of it\\'s content, while charging it on a DLC price scale...and a cheap one at that.\\nAnd people STILL complain.\\nIf you enjoyed the stories of the Wild Hunt, you\\'ll fall in love with this...excellent characterization with great dialogue, strong, compelling themes, more humor and horror, funny Geralt\\'s 11 heist, fun and challenging boss battles with enemies, game play enhancements and more.\\nThis is a purchase you won\\'t regret.',\n",
       " \"The moment I installed this I knew it’s a masterpiece. Freakin awesome DLC. That should be the example to follow. A full fledged game offered in a DLC. Witcher 3 is turning out to be a game of the century. Long Live CDPROJEKTRED. Engrossing story line and new memorable character from the first witcher. In this era of deceptive and disappointing tactics of micro transactions used by other companies to screw gamers outta their wallets CDPROJEKTRED's Witcher 3 is a treat  to all gamers across the globe.. Rockstar, Ubi, EA are u guying watching??\",\n",
       " \"A great example of what DLC should be. It adds a new crafting system to the game and expands the world a bit. The real treat, however, is the story. Without spoiling anything, I'll say that the antagonist is one of the most interesting I've encountered in a video game, ever. I really enjoyed the 10 hours I put into and I think it's well worth the $15 it cost.\",\n",
       " 'This much better than original game. 10/10\\nWhat can i say else? Main story very interesting, not a lot of quests, but they realy interesting. I can recommend this expansion to everyone',\n",
       " 'The story is simply amazing, especially the parts about the new antagonist which is a very interesting character by himself.  Be warned though, the fights are much harder than in the original game and you have to adjust your tactics to the bosses as well as you can.',\n",
       " 'Epic story with tons of extra hours of gameplay. Devs advertised it as ~10hrs and i got about ~30hrs going slow. Very good value. Adds tons of new areas and the story of it is top-tier. Get this dlc already.',\n",
       " '\"Hearts of Stone\" is even better than \"The Witcher 3\" itself. It improves the game in every way (e. g. boss battles), especially the main story line of the dlc is better than the one of \"Wild Hunt\". \"Hearts of Stone\" is the best dlc I have ever played!',\n",
       " \"It is not a simple DLC but a complex, rich parallel storyline!\\nGreat music.\\nStory well told.\\n\\nI played it before the end of the main quest, and the intrigue is partially linked with some events in the game. Maybe if it wasn't detached into a separate DLC the integration could be better. However, it's 10/10 because is the best DLC I've seen so far.\",\n",
       " \"Probably one of the best games I ever played in my life (and i'm 37). The story and  flow is amazing. This is an amazing piece of art . I recommend it to everyone.\",\n",

       " 'Hollowknight is a challenging adventure crammed with content and secrets that will keep the player coming back for more  Exploration is complemented by tight combat and platforming mechanics  The game oozes immersive atmosphere through its charming art style  vague lore and ambient music  Reflecting on my  hour experience any gripes i had were few and far between  Although my experience was rewarding and memorable be forewarned the casual gamer may not find this experience enjoyableHollowknights mechanics leave every mistake at the players fault  The player is put in control of a nameless knight  From the start the knight has the ability to run jump attack in four directions left right up and down while airborne and utilize soul to heal Jumping isnt dictated like most platformers  Rather than having a short jump and a high jump the height of jumping isnt restricted to binary  Jump height is totally varied based on how long the button is held allowing for tight platforming sections to be in complete control of the player  The knight wields a nail  Which is a sword for insects  Attacks are executed near instant and have knock back on contact  Attacking an enemy downward while airborne if timed properly allows the knight to bounce consecutively with each successful hit  This downward attack also makes for interesting platforming sections where the knight must bounce off of spikes and other hazards to progress  As mentioned above the knight could also heal through soul  Soul is essentially a magic meter that charges when the knight lands attacks on enemies  To heal the knight must create a safe distance as healing takes a few seconds and could be interrupted by enemy attacks  This allows for a satisfying riskreward system where the player must decide if they will heal or sneak in more damage  The combination of these mechanics and mechanics you gain throughout your adventure makes for excellent exploration and intense boss fightsCheckpoints in this game are benches  At benches the player has the option to switch up charms which give bonus abilities such as a longer sword or faster attack execution Switching charms is restricted to benches so it is important make sure your load out matches what your next goal may be  The amount of charms the knight can equip is dictated by notches which are found throughout the adventure   It is possible to equip more charms than the notches allow but doing so will put the knight in an over charmed state which causes enemies to deal double damage  When you inevitably die you are returned  to the last bench you rested at  Upon returning to a bench after death the knights max soul is lowered all geo currency is lost and a shade is left behind  Max soul and geo can be regained by returning to the death location and defeating the shade but beware if the shade is not defeated and the knight dies before reaching it the geo is permanently lostExploration is at the forefront of this adventure  Hollowknight starts off a bit linear but quickly branches off into a perplexing cavern of secrets and danger  As the player explores and defeats bosses the knight gains new abilities such as a dash and a wall jump  These abilities allow progress in exploration and access to areas that at one point were inaccessible  For example you may come across an acidic lake that can only be traversed after you obtain a certain ability  Once you gain the ability the game doesnt hold your hand on what to do with it  Its up to the player to remember the acidic lake that is now cross able thanks to the knights new found power  This aspect of exploration is extremely rewarding Exploration is also rewarded with a seemingly endless amount of secrets which are a joy to discover  Each new area leaves you exploring without a map until you stumble upon the cartographer NPC Cornifer  Cornifer will sell you a map of the area for a reasonable amount of geo  It can be frustrating to explore an area without a map but thankfully Cornifer leaves a trail of feathers and has audio ques notifying the player as to when they are close to his locationThe art style Team Cherry chose is both dark and adorable simultaneously  The world is populated by insects who at times are aloof and at others arrogant but are always charming  The backgrounds are detailed and lovingly crafted while also doing a wonderful job differentiating the games diverse areas The ambient music and sound design only adds to the polish and immersion Though the music while exploring is mostly somber the music while fighting a boss is triumphant and epic which at time left me with chills and excitementHollowknight has little hand holding and the riskreward based challenge isnt for everyone but if you are looking for a memorable odyssey look no further',\n",

       " 'This game really surprised me At first it sends you into the woods or actually caves a bit directionless but the smooth combat and beautiful levels really impressed me after a while I actually like the fact that you dont have minimaps of new areas so it really feels like you are exploring Striking enemies recharges your soul meter that you can use to heal so even when low on health you are inclined to fight on which makes for some exciting moments when you are lost and low on health in some uncharted area For a metriodvania game it is also surprisingly nonlinear and big I would definitely recommend Hollow Knight if you like platformermetroidvania games',\n",

       " 'Let me preface this review by saying that Ive easily spent more than  hours on hollow knight Ive finished the core game but still havent done any content from the two major free expansions There is a game here for the playing and at a very palatable priceHollow Knight is truly a masterpiece It is artwork every environment drawn by hand in a consistent style that has unique flourishes for each local you visit The music is subtle but effective drawing you into the games atmosphere ever present never overbearing it brings to mind the haunting atmospheric music of Super Metroid And the gameplay this is a metroidvania to the bone a refinement of the best entries in the genre exuding far more personality from its environments than any other comparable game motivating me to backtrack and explore every nook and crannyAnd that leads me into my next point what hollow knight is not It is not a souls game as so many have mistakenly labeled it in a poor attempt to define its difficulty It is an explorationfocused metroidvania and it leans decidedly towards the metroid side of that formula The bosses are almost all optional the map is an interconnected maze full of secret doors that lead to new areas and new abilities many of the challenges come from precise platforming segments and tanky bosses with very learnable attacksHollow knight is a refinement of the best of the metroidvania genre But it still falls in some of the same traps that plauge even the greatest of these games The controls are notoriously punishing for new players and while hollow knight is better than the archaic and unintuitive super metroid it fails its new players by mysteriously mapping multiple seemingly important abilities to a single button while others are free only to reveal later that some new ability will slot in there Also almost everyone who I have had try this game complains that the jumping feels wrong for the first while this is because there is no momentum when you jump a classic metroid control feature if you jump from a standstill unlike in mario where if the stick is released in the air the player will continue to move forward in hollow knight the character must be precisely maneuvered while in the air and will stop dead in the horizontal if the stick is released This is by no means bad and it is in fact more precise than the mario style jumping but will leave you frustrated if you dont realize why you keep falling in the spikesIronically that frustration is probably hollow knights biggest weakness you might have noticed a few reviews or threads in forums that read something like I PLAYED FOR THREE HOURS AND THIS BOSS IS DUMB AND THIS GAME IS DUMB AND ITS NOT FAIR This is indeed somewhat childish bellyaching but it highlights a sentiment that youre likely to feel frustrated the beginning of the game sees you with the fewest abilities you have yet to acquire the token dash double jump wall jump ect that are the bread and butter of metroid style games This leaves the character controlling the worst out of the entire experience during the first two or three hours of gameplay And while hornet the first real boss isnt anything next to some of the others in the game you the new player also dont have any charms items you can equip to give you small bonuses or movement options This is exacerbated by the linear early game you cant progress without beating this particular boss so its easy to get frustratedAfter that short segment though the game opens up with many different routes largely solving that weakness and you acquire the dash ability making the player character much more fun to control if you can be patient with its steep early learning curve there is a world of quirky bugs and menacing bosses waiting to be discovered The game sucked me in letting me get lost in the deep winding caverns of hallownest for hours on end For me Hollow Knight was without question my favorite game in  And did i mention its CAD Thats like amazing Take a chance on this one you wont regret itTLDRHollow knight is beautiful and brimming with content but has a steep learning curve so be patient and you will be rewarded with a gem of a game that is worth every penny',\n",

       " 'Let me start off by saying I love the Dark Souls series and I have thoroughly enjoyed Dark Souls  However this game has disappointed me in more ways than I can count and honestly I am extremely angry at From Software for their obvious laziness in creating this game Lets start out with what is absolutely amazing about this game First off the weapons skill system The new skill system that has been implemented in Dark Souls  is a ton of fun and a great addition to the game It gives weapons a whole new purpose and can completely change the way you fightThe new enemies that have been added to the game are also very interesting with some terrifying or just plain strange enemy design similar to bloodborne On top of that each enemy you encounter has a very unique AI and skill set that will definitely test your limits without feeling unfairThis game took a lot of points from Dark Souls  and made a map that was interconnected in various ways with plenty of side areas you can go and explore for fun On top of that each side area has plenty of extra loot for you to find so it is always worth exploring everywhere you possibly can Add in that these various areas are extremely well made with beautiful and epic visuals and you have one of the if not the best made maps in all of the Dark Souls seriesThe upgrading system has also been updated as well Now it is always beneficial for you to infuse your weapons along with the fact that many new infusions have been added into the game like heavy sharp refined and deep It is also no longer very hard to find the titanite to upgrade your weapons like the other games in the series Often you can farm enemies for almost every single kind of titanite in the game and can collect more than enough each NG to fully upgrade up to eight weaponsNow it is time for me to tell you all why this game is such a HUGE let down It seems that literally none of the issues that plagued this game series ever since its inception have been fixed The camera angles are just as bad if not worse than Dark Souls  Especially when you get into any kind of small room or fight a big boss or monster you will often find you cannot see a single damn thing because your camera is stuck in some wall or pillarThey also have not fixed the issue of hitboxes in  this game You will often find yourself being hit by attacks that are very obviously not even close to your actual character This is especially prevalent in PVP where this issue is compounded by another huge issue in this series which is PVP lag You will often find your attacks simply do not hit players or they will suddenly teleport a couple feet every few seconds or that you will suddenly be backstabbed by a person who literally seemed to teleport behind you Mix that with the absolutely atrocious hitboxes in this game and you are just asking for extreme amounts of rageTalking about PVP I seriously want to ask From Software if they have ever heard of the word unbalanced This games PVP system is probably the most broken I have seen in the entire series of Souls games There are a few weapons and build sets that you can get in the game that will make you able to easily  hit kill inescapable combo kill literally anyone whereas other weapons are like pea shooters in comparison Add in that there are multiple weapons that have a vastly better moveset than other weapons to the point where it is just completely unfair and you have DS PVP A good example of this would be the Farron Greatsword and dagger combo weapon versus the Dark Sword The Dark Sword is a small sword and should therefore be able to hit much faster than the Greatsword and dagger combo correct Nope in this game the greatsword has multiple attacks that are light years faster than the Dark Sword as well as large sweeping attacks that can take away your entire stamina bar by blocking just once On top of all of that the Greatsword and dagger combo weapon also has multiple moves that give them unassailable poise even if they are wearing light armorI am greatly disappointed in this game because of the fact these game breaking issues have still been made into this game and have even been generally accepted by the community I personally think it is absolutely ridiculous that a big game developer like From Software would release a game with this many glitches and huge issues that have been apparent since the first game And I assure you they will never fix any of these issues in any patch so I can rest assured knowing my score on this game wont change I genuinely enjoy the game and I think it is a great finale to the series however I cannot get over these huge glaring issues',\n",
       " 'Dark Souls  is a fitting end to the series with many throwbacks and superb gameplay systemsGameplayThe Combat mechanics are what you would expect from a Souls game only slightly refined and the addition of weapon arts is a fun new wrinkle that adds depth to each of the weapons The exploration is one of the highlights of any From game and DS is no exception peaking around a corner only to find a rare piece of equipment or perhaps a Titanite source is always a reviling moment Or perhaps fighting through tough enemies to reach a drop that benefits you greatly The sense of scope is also back with paths that connect and being able to look down upon a path you just traveled through hours before is satisfyingStoryThe lore is as always obtuse and cryptic however it is there if you chose to look and listen The game is not to hard to grasp but the further you poke your nose the more engrossed you become with the world Also for souls veterans such as myself there are many callbacks to the original DS that will make any fan happy and surprisedPresentationThe Graphics are nice and while it wont blow you away the different locales and the variety of environments makes it so you never get bored For the most part the game ran smooth on PS but there were some moments of framerate dips and slowdowns in certain areasfightsOverall Dark Souls  is an excellent send off to the series and one that seems like a love letter to fans once the credits roll and any souls fans will enjoy the ride till the fire fades',\n",
       " 'Dark Souls  encapsulates  the essence of both dark souls  and bloodborne in a way that feels almost seamlessly fluid The environment in Dark Souls  is a blatant mixture of both games in a commonly not so subtle way The undead settlement and most of the early game locations has a very strong bloodborne feel while the later locations in the game give off the same tone as the first dark souls gameThe combat allows for the use of shields once more yet shields still hold less power than they did in dark souls and maintains the strategy of dodging first blocking second that bloodborne incorporated Many early game weapons are versatile enough to be able to be used until very late game content like the long sword for example Bosses in dark souls  are no less brutal than its predecessors either Right off the bat you are thrust into an intense fight with a large knight and then when you think youve figured him out he transforms into another monster entirely and forces the player to change their tactics and rethink their strategy This is a theme that is held all the way through the game and forces the player to become a quick thinker or be punished And that is the beauty of the game A game that forces the player to get better without any handicaps to help you succeed is exactly what the souls series has thrives off of for years and this is no different Sadly now that dark souls has successfully made it to the mainstream more and more people are playing which means there are more casual gamers that will give the game a bad name and call it unfair even though its just them not understanding the concept of the game and also drive away many of the experienced souls veterans who partially love the game because of its exclusivityIn a completely unbiased review Dark Souls  is near perfect for souls standards but doesnt deserve a  because it doesnt just borrow from its previous titles but straight up steals from it by literally recreating areas from previous games and npcs as well and although this is cool for nostalgia it is also very uncreative Along with that some of the level design is questionable That being said besides recreated levels and some questionable level design choices dark souls  has reminded me the scope of the original while also maintaining some modern flair',\n",
       " 'This game is entirely about diving at the right times to avoid your opponents autotargeting or avoiding colossal monsters attacks which penetrate walls somehow While it has its moments between incredible settings and epic boss fights the combat in general is busted There is no other way to explain the insane precision of the regular AI who can pivot a hundred and eighty degrees in a fraction of a second while still attacking you somehow In boss fight or fights against larger monsters especially and in fights with monsters in general you will certainly die more than once being struck through a wall Youll also die falling off of ledges because your character has to leap forward to attack and half of the fights take place on some tight rope a halfmile above the earth for some reason Enjoy playing the same  meter stretch of gameplay for a whole day dying in inexplicable ways and holding in your tears of shame and rage while trying to justify having spent  on a rageinduced brain tumour',\n",

       " 'This third and final entry in the Dark Souls series takes quite some inspiration from its cousin Bloodborne and that may be a very good or bad thing depending on how much you enjoyed the Sony exclusive For me it was definitely a plus for I always preferred fastpaced and sleek combat over an overdefensive one and thats a good thing because DSs fun combat system is the only thing that makes me want to come back despite the uninspired design of some areas and overall lack of interesting bossesThe main game experience is expanded by two separate DLCs Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City that shouldve been released as one in the first place considering how small and lackong in content AOA is that add new weapons and armor pieces that will make PVP enthusiasts happy but do little to really impress the PVE crowd offering a mediocre story conclusion full of plotholes and yet another swampy area nobody asked for',\n",

       " 'Im not sure what to think about this game  They copy the first Dark Souls boss by making him incredibly difficult  Thats basically the hardest boss in the game since you can now level up equip a decent weapon and team up with  more players to fight them  This game is really good but it suffers some pacing issues with boss difficulty  Some of the bosses are pretty good while others really go down with some simple movement  One thing thats great about this game is the major differences it has with previous games but that could also be its major downfall  I didnt quite find a dungeon as satisfying as Sens fortress  There also wasnt a boss as amazing as  the wolf in the forest or Smaugh and the other guy  Recycling the same gear game after game is not acceptable  The majority of the armor and weapons are completely recycled  Some of the new ones are really great but I cant help but notice they dont have many new offerings to the world  Some items are totally ruined by redesign like the ring of sacrifice  Not being able to upgrade armor makes the armor pointless and even with the strongest armor in the game I was getting hit with ridiculous amounts of damage as I progressed  I beat the final boss on the first try but took  tries to beat the first  That first boss wasnt very fun to fight either  He also had more interesting phases so it felt like the game ran out of gas  If you played Dark Souls  youll be dissapointed that there isnt a treasure dragon cove like there is with that game  There are many disturbing zombie areas with gross explosions out of bodies and just sickening horror which wasnt what I was looking for in this  I always liked Mayasakis art style and surprisingly awesome fantasy world  There are sections where this was done well though however  The dragons are much better designed and fit with the art style of the world in this than Dark Souls   There are some pretty cool areas but it can be almost too city focused and not enough mountains and foresty areas like with the other games  The dungeon here dungeon there gets old and repetitive  The biggest letdown is the covenants are quite boring and dont offer you any real good gear  They nerfed weapons in the middle of the release which made some weapons completely suck right when the patch hit  Im thinking estoc but I noticed I couldnt get any real damage out of certain weapons and I couldnt see why they werent doing much against some bosses even if I had it fully upgraded with  strength  So the balanced rule has kind of killed the funfactor of the game and I didnt feel as powerful as I usually do at the end of other Dark Souls games  Utlimately the new engine is great but the framerates at moments really slow you down but not the boss  Delayed responses in dives and doubling your strike because the game lagged can be frustrating especially when this causes you to die or get hit really hard even though you posted your shield  If youre looking for a significantly better game better buy a ds and stick to Monster Hunter   When I dive my guy dives when I swing my weapon my weapon swings no more no less  Thanks Mayasaki but kind of dissapointed and expected a little more  The attempts to fix the game only killed the enjoyment of many items depth of upgrading gear  the feeling of being powerful at the end so overall I give this a   Thanks for reading',\n",

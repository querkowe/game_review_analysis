       "['Easily one of the best, if not the most well known, DS releases of the year. Includes beautiful plot with hints throughout, challenging enough to keep you interested without becoming a game of random clicking, and an OST which is incredible. Shu Takumi has done an excellent job on this game, both in aesthetics and in concept. I\\'m hoping to see a sequel in some form1Hands down, one of the best games on DS. Ghost Trick is completely brilliant from start to finish- with great puzzles, fantastic characters, an engaging story and a truly awesome ending. Each character is fully realised, and everyone has a part to play in this stellar tale. The puzzles can be a bit hit and miss occassionally, but you\\'ll forgive it, if only because it\\'s so utterly likeable.Innovative and addictive style of gameplay, engaging story rich in creativity without being cliche,  catchy music that fits the situation in the game, and a cast of unforgettable characters and their eccentric personalities. Ghost Trick is truly a heartfelt and magical experience that proves how amazing a handheld video game can make someone feel and shows that the Nintendo DS is still a worthy console.Phenomenal. This game is the perfect blend of puzzle solving, mystery, and creative gameplay. The characters are charming, the story is captivating, and the puzzles are generally well done, with only a few strange ones here and there. If you love a good mystery game this is something you must play!I picked up this game expecting good things from the people who brought us Phoenix Wright, but Ghost Trick has exceeded my every expectation. The gameplay is so innovative, yet at the heart of this game is some truly fanciful storytelling. Contrast this with the Professor Layton series, which for all the praise it gets, does not make any attempt to integrate the puzzles into the actual story. With Ghost Trick, the puzzling is so seamlessly interwoven that you really feel you have a direct hand in the characters\\' actions. The character design is like a super stylized comic book, and the character movements are so graceful that I have to believe that animators, not programmers, designed the sequences. I hope that Ghost Trick becomes a series on the new 3DS platform, as there are a lot of possibilities when you factor dimensionality. But even if it doesn\\'t, Ghost Trick stands on its own as a very complete, deeply enjoyable piece of art.This game is perfection in it\\'s genre.\\nGreat concept, gorgeous art, fun gameplay, deep story with gazillion plot twists and rewarding ending.\\nOne of the best games for DS.Sadly, I didn\\'t enjoy this game, mostly for reasons that probably only apply to me. Although I\\'m a massive fan of the Phoenix Wright games, Ghost Trick, even with its similarities to the Ace Attorney trilogy, failed to impress me.\\nThe game looks good; it\\'s stylized and colorful, but the soundtrack didn\\'t quite click with me. I also didn\\'t really enjoy the gameplay; I solved the earlier puzzles with ease or by trial and error that immediately paid off, but a later puzzle had me absolutely stumped and brought my playthrough to a screeching halt. I\\'m sorry, but I didn\\'t even like the puzzle-solving itself simply because it didn\\'t feel satisfying enough for the most part.\\nThe thing that annoys me the most about this title is its odd sense of humor. A character getting killed by ending up squashed underneath of a giant roast chicken struck me as embarrassingly bizarre, and I found many of the characters to be off-putting as well. I\\'m fully aware that this is just a personal issue and that many people will enjoy Ghost Trick\\'s style of humor and mystifying plot, but I\\'m afraid I simply didn\\'t.\\nI\\'m sorry! I want to like Ghost Trick.  Ghost Trick fans, please don\\'t take this as an insult; this is simply my unfortunate opinion.The worst part about playing Ghost Trick is that you\\'ll spend the rest of your life telling people to play Ghost Trick.It\\'s innovative, the characters are entertaining and rememberable, the animation is absolutely fantastic, the music is catchy, and the puzzles are intelligent. Sure, usually the same method of ghost and tricking works for most puzzles,ï»¿ but that\\'s not the point. It\\'s a genuinely fun game to play. It is a one-shot wonder however, once you complete it chances are you won\\'t want to return to it.One of the, if not, THE best DS game of all time. With a stellar plot, lovable characters and charming gameplay, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Capcom.... RELEASE THIS ON THE IOS IN NORTH AMERICA!!!!!... Please?While the puzzles can get a little repetitive, it\\'s more than made up for with everything else. The plot is great, the humor is exactly what you might expect from the creators of Phoenix Wright, and it\\'s all held up by a fantastic cast of characters. It\\'s not an exaggeration to say this is one of the best, if not the best game on the DS.The game is beautiful in almost every way, and if you have the money, buy it. It is not the longest game in history, but it makes you feel so many emotions. I\\'m not gonna say anything else.Mediocre thrash metal that doesn\\'t deserve such high ratings. I don\\'t know how such a large number of players, in principle, can like such a talentless and negligent project.How was this shit in the ranking?The Witcher documents the last Sigu from AhuyaShu Takumi might have topped Phoenix Wright. The writing is sheer perfection, seemingly simple at first until it starts revealing the tricks up its sleeve.  The gameplay is quite clever and adds more elements both without ever running out of ideas before introducing them and building the story tremendously. The last several hours feature so many twists that the story and puzzles mesh, putting emotion into rotating a piston or opening a trashcan so that you aren\\'t merely completing a level but saving the lives of characters you actually care about.The only possible way for Takumi to improve the experiences he\\'s created is to somehow expand the gameplay elements while keeping the size and sweep of the story intact. Until then, the next iterations of Ace Attorney and Ghost Trick will be warmly welcomed.This game is brilliant, very pretty and I must mention that the Animation is almost perfect. It makes the characters very charismatic and the story even more believable.  The design is well done and there is a good balance of difficulty. With many puzzles they throw at you small hints, not obvious enough to spoil the fun and obvious enough to push your thinking-machine. The humor also surprised me in this game, it made me smile and giggle a lot. I recommend this game to anyone who like puzzle games and/or liked the Phoenix Wright serie. Yes it\\'s a 10 point, 9 wouldn\\'t be enough. Enjoy!One of the best games on the DS. IGN summed it up perfectly by saying that Ghost Trick brings innovation to an ageing genre. The game draws your total attention for the full 12 hours of game play. I was fixated for the duration and near tears come the end. Whilst there is a lot of text and sometimes you would just like to get on with the game, the storyline is gripping and the characters memorable and heart warming. Don\\'t miss this game!There is thousands of puzzlers on the ds, but none of them are as unique as this brilliant title. Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective starts with your character, Sissel, lying dead on the floor. When you are dead you discover that you have special powers. You can possess items and trick them, causing the item to do a action. It may sound strange, but it is very easy to use and feels very fresh. You then find out that you cant remember anything about who you were and why you were killed, and that you only have till sunrise before you go to the afterlife. Sissel decides that he is going to use his last hours on earth wisely and try and find out his identity. Its a great story and it gets better and better as you progress. Another brilliant thing about this game is the spectacular graphics. It is very detailed and when people and items move it looks amazing and is very smooth. If you are looking for a new puzzler on the ds which is a fresh and thrilling experience this is the game you need.Fun and well animated. An adventure that no one should miss, and a must buy for every DS owner. If you don\\'t have one, borrow it. This game may be one of the best DS games of the year and even the best.Fatherless mobile parachaus with an assessment A 9.7, as they say, somewhere we turned the wrong wayI LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!! A genius idea, with a great story, fantastic twist, amazingness!!! A MUST BUY!Pretty good until the last few chapters, where all the interesting plot points were explained in the worst, most cliche way possible. Level design was okay, but there wasn\\'t much worth mentioning.I was really disappointed with this game given its quite high user reviews. The flow is terrible you are constantly having to click on dialog boxes. The story line is really bad, which would be less of a problem if you could skip the story. The puzzles are not worth the wait to get to them. Don\\'t waste your money.\"Infinite waiting for a plot twist that doesn\\'t deliver\" is how I would describe this game in one sentence. The gameplay seems interesting at first but quickly falls off as it is extremely tedious, repetitive and most of all  incredibly easy. I would estimate there are about two 10 second segments that offer any challenge at all for a person of average intelligence.\\n\\nThe animation is excellent and story has great potential that sadly gets wasted in the second half of the game. Even the pacing is really poor since the animation and dialogue is slow and cannot really be fast forwarded.Single Player/Multi Player (2/2)\\n\\n(If the single player is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no multplayer) (If the multiplayer is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no single player)\\n\\nGameplay (2/2)\\n\\nVisuals/Story (2/2)\\n\\n(If the visuals are better than the story, review this section as if it had no story) (If the story is better than the visuals, review this section as if the visuals didn’t matter)\\n\\nAccessibility/Longevity (2/2)\\n\\n(Review this section only on Accessibility if the game has no longevity) (Review this section only on longevity if the game isn’t accessible)\\n\\nPricing (1/2)\\n\\nWildcard (+1)\\n\\nThis is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.\\n\\nThe review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.\\n\\nThe scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.\\n\\nNotice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section\\n\\nThe final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.This game was well done, but unfortunately the ending was unsatisfying. It\\'s like they didn\\'t know what to do with the story. Pretty disappointed. If the ending was good the game would\\'ve been at least an 8 in my books.\\n\\n[Spoiler Alert]\\n\\nSo, about the ending. It\\'s revealed that you\\'re a cat at the end. The problem with this is they never properly set it up. This ending would have been fine, if they made it legitimate throughout the course of the game. But they didn\\'t. They gave very few clues about your identity, and at times the clues were contradicted, so that made it confusing.\\n\\nThey did this whole nonsense about you not having memory of who you were because your body was obscured, and that you are a cat. But this does not fall in line with what they established about animals. The dog Missile had the personality of a dog, and he could remember himself for the most part. So, they gave us observations about animals, but did not follow it for your character the cat. They made double standards.\\n\\nSo, you\\'re a cat, but you act 100% like a human? Not like an animal? They threw you off from figuring it out on your own. They never gave any good hints. Just small things here, and there that weren\\'re really substantive.\\n\\nIf they wanted to fix this they should have shown the cat more, first of all, and made your character behave more like a cat. They could\\'ve done this in numerous ways. Let\\'s say that scene where Sissel goes to the chicken restaurant. Maybe he\\'d say he doesn\\'t like chicken as much as fish. Or make Sissel have a good sense of smell, and only he could see in the night, but no one else can.\\n\\nPerhaps be a little cheeky, and he says, \"Oh, how did I survive? It\\'s like I have 9 lives.\" Things like that. Just make it obvious but not too obvious. When the ending is revealed the player should say, \"Of course!\" Instead of \"wtf?\"\\n\\nYou know, they just didn\\'t use the stereotypes of cats to the benefit of the player. Why not make Missile a little more hostile to Sissel? Because you know they say cats, and dogs don\\'t get along. How about Sissel taking the form of the man in red, and poking fun at his appearance going, \"Hmm, so this is how I look? I thought I\\'d be more handsome.\"\\n\\nEtc. These are just suggestions, but the whole surprise was not set up very well.… ExpandHmn, so this is what the spirit realm is like?\\n\\nFrom the same devs as Phoenix Wright, comes this little charmer.  GHOST TRICK!\\nYou play as a spirit who has a lost memory, and you work through the game to find out who you are.  Such a story based game may put a few people off, but it IS a good one.\\n\\nGameplay is much like Phoenix Wright, as in you solve simple puzzles.  Much like said game, there is  usually only one solution, so you repeat until that has been solved.  Puzzles are solved by \"possessing\" things, but your power is not strong, so you can mostly just slightly move things.  Another character you come across can \"swap\" objects around with the same shape.\\n\\nThe game plays more like an interactive story book, so if mad action is what you\\'re searching for, you won\\'t find it.  Zip.\\nYou could finish it very quickly if you skipped story and knew all the puzzles, but it took me around 25-30 hours to complete.\\n\\nWhere the game EXCELS in is its story.  You follow a spirit trying to regain its memory, but you only have until midnight- or you die!  Following the story, you develop an attachment to the other characters, who are all incredibly well thought out.  Each has their own style, noone is generic.\\n\\nGraphics are also beautiful.  So pleasurable to the eye.  The way that the cop in white dances around whilst walking.  Animation and graphics style works so well on a system as old as the NDS.\\n\\nLets put all the people who like action movies like \"Terminator 4\", or \"AVP\" onto one side,  then put something like \"Bladerunner\" on the other.\\nThem who like story driven narrative (Bladerunner) will love this.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the game mechanics were clever. Just when the gameplay starts to get a little too familiar, they add a welcome change. The characters are fantastic, if a bit ridiculous, but endearing and charming. The animations are superb. I\\'ll never forget Detective Cabalena\\'s \"walk\" (if you can even call it \\'walking\\'). It\\'s a nice touch when EVERYTHING they present to you becomes important later on. I\\'m looking at you, [spoiler]    and [spoiler]    . The ending didn\\'t tie up every loose end, but it\\'s more than satisfactory regardless. Although there\\'s not really a reason to play it again, as there is only one linear story-arc, it\\'s worth at least a rent to play through it once. You shouldn\\'t regret it.fun gameplay, quirky over-the-top animation, fantastic story, this game is just great however it has a lot of text though dialog is top-notch, solutions however only have one answer and one solution, trial and error come with fun results but with the concept of a game that lets you take and manipulate tons of things, it feels quite restrictingGhost Trick has to be one of my favourite DS games. The story telling is on par with Phoenix Wright, a game I thought couldn\\'t be topped. You take control of Sissel, a ghost who\\'s been murdered but can\\'t remember who killed him or why. After death he recieved powers to posess and manipulate objects, and travel back in time to before a death. The puzzles in this game consist of saving a character before they\\'re murdered or die by moving around objects to change the situation. The graphics are unique and the character animations are really fluent. The characters in this game are all full of life and the story is one of the most engaging things on the DS. My only gripes with this game would have to be the inconsistant difficulty (the final puzzle is very easy to solve yet ones earlier on in the game are brain scratchers) and that the story takes a short while to get going. But once it did, I literally couldn\\'t put the game down to find out what happened next. This is essential to Phoenix Wright fans and gamers alike and if you haven\\'t bought it yet, why?Great game. A interesting mystery story. A good system to resolve enigmas. Good visuals and very charismatic characters. I recommend to everyone this game.This game is so good it surprised me, even if I already knew it had to be good I didn\\'t expect it to be SO good. The game is entertaining from start to end, with so many twists and turns it will let you wanting for more and more as the chapters flow by and the mystery unravels. Animation-wise it is simply splendid, the pixel graphics are gorgeous and the music incredibly fitting. The game also makes great use of chromostereopsis, especially in the ghost world, to give a sense of depth that those who perceive the effect to a great extent (like myself) will double their enjoyment of the title. Gameplay stays fresh and satisfying for the whole duration. If I had to find a defect, if we want to call it so, it\\'s its strict linearity; you are rarely given an opportunity to explore and look for clues on yourself, instead the characters themselves give so many hints you will want to cover your eyes to leave the surprise unspoiled. Anyway this is a minor flaw and it leaves the game a true gem.Incredible story, mechanics, animations.  The tale is harrowing, chilling and simply brilliant.  Buy this game, you will not be disappointed.  This game deserves the attention of the entire industry for its uniqueness.A fantastic story, with a great plot. The influence from Ace Attorney is great (and is a good thing). The game is not very long (about 10 hours), but it is very funny. There aren\\'t impossible \"trick\". Music is great, so the game engine. 9 of 10 only because for me is short.Underrated joy of the DS. 10/10 Story 10/10 Art 10/10 Character 10/10 MusicSuch an awesome story, artstyle and cool idea. And the cute doggie! I wish it was remastered or at least ported on PC/Consoles. This is the definition of genre perfection.This is one of my favourite DS games of all time\\n\\nGreat story, it\\'s intriguing and it kept me on edge, it\\'s something you have to experience yourself.\\nThe characters is the reason why I love this game so much, each character has a distinctive and likable personality, I ended up caring for them near the end.\\n\\nReally innovative gameplay, since you are a ghost, you have to reach different objects to control them, the concept alone is awesome and the execution is just as incredible.\\nThe graphics won\\'t blow you away but for a DS game, it\\'s pretty good.\\n\\nThe only problem with the game is that it\\'s not for everyone, if you don\\'t like games with a lot of text then you will hate this game.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you have a DS (or a 3DS) BUY IT NOW!!!The Ace Attorney series were a great example of a story-focused game that featured a story that would benefit from being told through it\\'s particular medium. Ghost Trick is another great example. It features a compelling narrative which somehow manages to come together well at the end, memorable characters, a soundtrack which enhances atmosphere at crucial moments and beautiful animation. It also features unique gameplay, which greatly makes use of the DS as well. In some ways, this gameplay gives it another layer on top of the Ace Attorney games, which were pretty much visual novels. Fantastic game.The game has aged incredibly well. The humor, graphics and music is on point after all these years and this game has one of the best game intros of all time. Personally it\\'s my favorite of all time, too. It\\'s incredible and definitely worth a buy. Best suited for NDS but also for iOSIt is a shame this game does not have the reputation it deserves. Superb story-telling, told in its own unique game design, with lovable characters. Mechanics with good development pace, stunning art and BEAUTIFUL animations, brilliant OST... with the only, tiny downside of sometime hit-and-miss puzzle solving.\\n\\nI can\\'t help but find this game the best title from the author - Shu Takumi - and, by far, one of the bests on the DS.\\n\\nCapcom, get this series rolling again. You are missing a great opportunity. The Switch would be the perfect place for this gem.The most impressive games since I play Ace Attorney, Shu Takumi well work the execution is here too in this game but that\\'s all that\\'s not AA that\\'s Ghost Trick and my new favorite game.Absolutely incredible game.\\nDirected by Shu Takumi and OST by Masakazu Sugimori, the creator and composer for the original AA trilogy, and it shows. I would argue this is even better.\\nOne of a kind gameplay, and when I booted up the game a decade ago, I mistook the game animations for a cutscene before realizing that was the actual game.\\nEverything about this game is stellar.Ghost Trick is hands down the best game I\\'ve ever played and possibly the best game ever made. There are absolutely 0 areas where Ghost Trick does not excel at. It\\'s charming cast of characters, it\\'s soundtrack, it\\'s visuals, it\\'s story; everything in Ghost Trick is perfect. Every animation is lovingly crafted and look absolutely fantastic considering its a DS game. It\\'s by far the prettiest game on the system and it\\'s beautiful style hasn\\'t aged a single day. Every character design is perfect and tells you everything you need to know about them, which is even more satisfying as the game\\'s plot moves along. The soundtrack is perfect, every song in it is memorable and every character theme gives you an instant idea of exactly what their character is.\\nThe story is probably the best in any video game ever. Like any good mystery, it foreshadows its twists while still leaving you surprised at them. I think Ghost Trick has left me the most surprised out of any game I\\'ve ever played, and it\\'s worth doing a replay to see how genius the writers were. I cannot praise its story enough. It is just that good.\\nIf you have not played Ghost Trick, there is absolutely no reason you should not be playing it right now. It\\'s simple and easy controls make it immediately accessible to anyone, and it is overall one of the finest crafted games ever made. You owe it to yourself to play this game.[spoiler]    A cat that i controlled from the beginning :v. That was an outstanding oneAt first, i thought that the soul i had controlled was the *player* (means who play this game), i put a lots of theory for that *thought* beacause that was the only explaination for the wild soul appeared at the junkyard, i made a mistake - that i didn\\'t see cat cageWell, i had played all games of ace attorney series before i played this game and i was confident that i get used to the way Shu Takumi write story. BUT NO, this masterpiece is diffirent (even more outplay than Prof Layton vs AA) and i got outplayed (worse than being rickrolled)Anyway this game deserve 9 point but for outplayed me. 10… ExpandAn amazingly written story, told with a very fast pace(the entire game is set in one single night), with funny characters who get deeper and deeper as you go on. Gameplay is original and quirky, it makes you use your brain without feeling heavy at all.\\nThe game is a pleasure to look at with it\\'s astonishing 2D, detailed and well animated and the soundtrack isn\\'t bad either, probably not at masterpiece level like everything else in the game but still good.One of my 3 most favourite video games... I absolutely love and cherish this game!This game, like many other players, totally surprised me in so many good ways. This is one of the best games on the DS.Finally, got third place, this game deserves it as the best storyline I\\'ve ever played. Not to mention the animation and music. The well-executed and the best game on Nintendo DS platform. Hands down.The game is divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The game is **** because the plot taking place in the game is complete nonsense, the music, and indeed the whole soundtrack itself, does not cling. It feels like the game was created for consoles after the next generation of video game consoles. Since the game has realistic motion animations. But why for after the next generation of consoles, the answer is simple, PIXELS! From the Nintendo DS hardware, the game pulls out all the juices, which makes the game look like some kind of unfinished.It turns out quite interestingly that I did not perceive Nintendo DS before, as a normal console, since I believed that there were no normal games. BUT! At first I played ACE Attorney, then in Professor Layton, Hotel Dusk ... The last straw was Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. After that, I radically changed my point of view about this console. Grafing, perhaps with graphics. She is lovely! Like the visual style itself. The game perfectly combines 3D models of characters with 2D environment. This cannot but rejoice! The musitis is all the same as well as with graphics. The melodies are remembered, and some I liked it so much that I am listening to them now, while I am writing this view. Hyampleheimple is quite interesting here. You must save the lives of people, being a ghost. There are separate mechanics that allow you to do this. They will be supplemented as the plot develops. The plot is twisted here, but it will be difficult to get confused in it. Our main character is killed for unknown reasons. We must find out everything before dawn. Evaluation in principle, this is all I wanted to express about this game. Ghost Trick is an excellent visual short story that I recommend for passing.',\n",
       " 'Probably the best roguelikes on console this gen, even more addicting than the already awesome Shiren titles. NiS obviously put a lot of effort into this title, and it definitely shows thanks to the plentiful options for customization.If you aren\\'t familiar with roguelikes, there is something you need to know from the beginning: roguelike games, like this one, remove all of your items and revert you to level 1 every time you die.  Before you click back on your browser though, know that this isn\\'t a bad thing.  Items in the game are easy to come by and really aren\\'t that great anyways.  Dying though increased your max level and helps you gain skills and powers.  So in a way, dying = surviving...in some odd way.  When you die, or complete a level, all the levels you accumulated on your current romp through the dungeon level will increase your overall level and your strength and other stats increase.  The basic gameplay is dungeon crawling with similarities to Shiren the Wandered and the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series.  Just know that every move moves everyone else in the dungeon.  It\\'s turn based, but pretty fast turned based.If challenge scares you, you might shy away from the title, but you\\'d be missing a pretty good romp through a very good game.NIS has always written excellent dialogue, and NIS America has always localized beautifully. Great humor, smooth gameplay, lots of things to customize, and doesn\\'t take itself too seriously. If you think \"Prinny dood!!\" is an awesome thing to shout, then this game is for you.It is really amazing to me that a game like this is getting as good of reviews as it is.  Typically, the roguelike genre tends to be fairly polarized, and has a hard time getting higher than a 70%.  I think the scores really reflect the quality of the game.  Having played several mystery dungeon roguelikes, I find this game a real pleasant surprise as far as gameplay.  The formula is shaken up by the line of sight of the enemies, and the \"total level\" you earn as you proceed.  Even if you don\\'t generally like roguelike gameplay, this game may change your mind.\\nThe story is entertaining, in line with Disgaea in satire, but for me doesn\\'t provide the main draw.  The solid, consistently entertaining gameplay really makes this a must buy in my book.Truly a unique experience, Zettai Hero Project bring great humor, loads of customization, and unique gameplay that no PSP owner should overlook, especially those who are fans of NIS\\'s other works such as Disgaea and Soul Nomad.This game\\'s name. \\'Nuff said.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000It\\'s one thing to make a game where dying means you have to start a piece of the game over. It\\'s another thing to make a game that actively punishes the player by effectively erasing their file. This game takes away your equipment, your experience points, your level progress, and your money should you be unfortunate enough to die, and dying is very easy thanks to the broken enemy strength curve. There\\'s no point in playing this game, because at some point you\\'re going to die, and when you do, it will be as if you had never started playing, since you\\'ll lose all the things you earned up to that point.Mediocre thrash metal that doesn\\'t deserve such high ratings. I don\\'t know how such a large number of players, in principle, can like such a talentless and negligent project.The game is overrated and it sucks and the user score is to high ⁰000000000Anime, serious?How did it end up in the name in the name of the Higher Forces?Stop this planet, I will go outAnimeshniki once again showed what shit -eating they are, how can this parach have a higher assessment than that of GTA, witcher and other masterpieces?I think the scores really reflect the quality of the game.  The basic gameplay is dungeon crawling with similarities to Shiren the Wandered and the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series.The game is divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The game is divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this game is so unique it\\'s worth playing an insane hidden gem and a truly underrated masterpiece damm its so good.',\n",

       " 'Endwalker solidifies FF14s Status as the king of the mmo genre - a masterpiece through and through, put together through years of love, crafted with passion and pure magic.Square Enix somehow finds a way to deliver a beautiful ending that ties together the various outlying threads that have been set up over the past 10 years. Endwalker brings together a beautiful soundtrack across the various forms of content that leaves you wanting to hear more even when you\\'re not playing. The content itself pulls out emotions of joy and sadness that captivate you through the amazing story, enchanting scenery/zone designs, and character development.\\n\\nAside from the story and zones the additional content added to the game such as job changes bring a refreshing improvement to the job actions that makes them more fluid and enjoyable to play. The new jobs Reaper and Sage are not only creative but engaging jobs that excel expectations in gameplay and design. They lie amongst the most interesting and fun jobs to play not only for their respective roles but in the entire game and MMO genre.\\n\\nThe servers have been facing minor issues (such as queues and login errors) as any new MMO expansion faces but Square Enix has provided daily updates on the status of server improvements and has been attempting to combat the issues as best as they can. Users have even been provided with free game time as compensation for the few issues. Considering the semi-conductor shortage that has made it near impossible for them to acquire the proper server technology to rid users of the server issues completely their active communication and determination convinces me that the minor server issues will be resolved quickly.\\n\\nAll in all Final Fantasy XIV\\'s Endwalker expansion is arguably their best work to date and any fan of the game will appreciate the thrilling and emotionally impactful end of the Hydaelyn and Zodiark saga. The expansion excels expectations in every aspect and leads me to believe that Endwalker is not only amongst if not the best expansion to date within any MMO, but that Final Fantasy XIV is the definitive best MMO to play right now.The best story, full of love and hope.\\nIt is extremely heavy and shocking, yet it is extremely warm and passionate.\\nEach dungeon is very impressive and amazing, and the trails are even more astonishing.\\nEndwalker is undoubtedly the most perfect ending chapter of this great tale.Issa masterpiece. For real though Endwalker acts as the perfect end to the first saga of ffxiv. The new zones are amazing, the music is phenomenal and the story is on par, if not better than shadowbringers. So far ive only played Gunbreaker but the changes to it feel really good. TLDR Issa masterpiece.It seemed impossible, but they surprised us again. So many good references to Final Fantasy IV.What are temporary server issues in the face of a pretty much perfect expansion?\\n\\nThough slightly slow at the start, everything past the midpoint is astonishingly amazing, and it wraps up in what I feel pretty confident in calling a splendid ending.The story is even better than Shb. Staging was better and we get almost no filler story arcs.\\nClass updates are nice, even small quality of life changes like the timing of the scholar shield. Summoner maybe a little too dumb, but feels good.\\nZone-wise, Old Sharlayan is the best city in the game, calm music with a layout around the teleporter. Radz-at-Han is not my favorite, the outdoor zones and the city and you can\\'t mount in the stones in the transition area (I was hoping we could mount again after little Eulmore).\\nOverall, the variety of zones with many changing themes is brilliant.\\nThe only question I\\'m a bit scared of is whether this expansion will be a first single-player first and a multiplayer second expansion again. Story-wise, Shb was brilliant, but when it comes to gameplay, Stoormblood is unbeatable.\\nI hope we can achieve a better balance with this expansion, but that can only show the future.\\nFor the story and the first 20-30 hours 10/10.Brilliant and ever-beautiful storytelling complimented with great visuals and cinematography even if the cutscenes can get a  bit verbose at times. Gameplay is as good as It\\'s always been, super well-done dungeons and duties. Honestly, if you\\'ve played though XIV far enough to reach this expansion you\\'re all but guaranteed an incredible experience. If Shadowbringers brought the feels, Endwalker walks all around in them.Barring the standard server login issues, once you get in there’s little to no input lag at all and I was never kicked from the game once.\\n\\nWhen looking at the story how they handled the entire arc from the last 11 years to come up with what they did is just awe inspiring.\\n\\nThe music in every new zone and dungeon is fantastic and though some dungeon weren’t as good as others all looked great and helped move the story forward in a good way. The level 90 dungeons being extra special in both sound and art design.\\n\\nAs for the jobs I have 1 of dps, healer and tank already at 90 and I’m in the process of getting tomes for my healer to raid. Most jobs are super solid though.\\n\\nSome could’ve gotten a bit more love and attention sure but we have to understand that not every job can be reworked at once. The ones that did get a rework seem great. SMN is my 1 dps to 90 it’s never felt better then now to be a SMN. SCH though could use some love. But I digress.\\n\\nAs for crafting and gathering I’ve only dabbled a little bit so far but with the changes and improvements they made in shadowbringers I’m sure that whatever entails being a lvl 90 crafter/gather is going to be just fine.\\n\\nI hope that everyone enjoys story and that the queue times get better. For me Endwalker was everything I could’ve hope for and more.This is the best expansion, MSQ (main scenario quest) is literally a masterpiece. New jobs fells very awesome.\\n\\n10/10The best expansion so far, closing the the era of Hydaelyn and Zodiark.\\n\\nI could not imagine how Final Fantasy XIV could top their game after the release of Shadowbringers and somehow they did it. Having unexpected twists and turns later on the story.\\n\\nWith the new raid tier \"Pandæmonium\" coming up, I just can\\'t wait to try it out in Savage.I created an account on metacritic just to rate 10 to this expansion, that\\'s how good it is.\\n\\nYes, it\\'s better than Shadowbringers.Now with the conclusion to the decade long arc, i can say, this is by far the best Final Fantasy story.\\nLoved the new locations, the enhancements to the jobs(+additions of the 2 new job classes).\\nThe little features they\\'ve added which made it even more immersive.\\nI can only praise this game!\\nI\\'d recommend this game to each and any FF and jrpg fan out there, even if you don\\'t like mmorpg\\'s, the game is simply worth it.This Expansion is everything I ever wanted. When I came from wow I was left without conclusions to the stories I loved but this game told me the best story I experienced in a very long time over the course of six years. I had my doubts if they could surpase the work they did in ShB. But after the Story starts a little bit witha  Slow-Burn they managed to finish this arc of with a Banger. It is amazing. The queue times could be handled better but I really can\\'t minus point them for.it as I log in before work and just adapt.Barring the initial server issues expected of any major MMO expansion launch, Endwalker serves as the magnum opus of FFXIV and Yoshi-P. The music, art, and writing are better than they\\'ve ever been, and I can\\'t wait to see what else the team has in store.This may be the only game whose story has made me cry repeatedly with it\\'s well-developed characters, intricate story and the genuinely emotional moments it takes the players through. Endwalker provides the game\\'s hundreds of hours long story with an extremely satisfying ending. The new dungeons and trials are very fun to play, with most of the combat mechanics having been given quality of life improvements without lowering the skill required to play them. I would highly recommend this over anything else to anyone wanting to dive into an MMORPG.There are minor drawbacks, but there is a greatness that overwhelms them all.And so ends the final chapter in the tale of the star.\\n\\nWhat a beautiful adventure, excellent ending for a story that\\'s been in the making for so many years. Everything pays off in the end, my satisfaction is immeasurable and I cannot wait for what Yoshi-P and the team have in store. The music is as always on point, a pleasure to listen every second of it. Fight encounters were really enjoyable and I\\'m looking forward to experiencing them again both in their regular and harder variants.\\n\\nWhat few flaws I found, seemed minuscule compared to all the great aspects of this expansion. I do not believe queues should in any way affect score of an expansion, as the reviews will affect decisions of people in the future where those issues will be no more and as it stands there was little they could have done to prevent them anyway.I didn\\'t think it was possible, but they topped Shadowbringers. After 60+ hours already at the time of writing (1000+ overall in FFXIV)  EW has turned out to be my favorite FF story in the whole franchise!An 8-year saga coming to an end. My only hope for EW was that they land the ending. And I can wholeheartedly say they did.\\n\\nEvery piece of your journey meant something. That sentence alone already says how much care they put into this.\\n\\nWhat a finale.Great MSQ, great music, great ending. Amazing experience, All the waiting is worth itAbsolutely amazing. This expansion leaves me quite speechless...\\n\\nNot sure how its possible, since Shadowbringers was ingenious and amazing and raised the bar very high. Yet, this expansion hits even harder,\\nEvoking depth of emotion, introspection and contemplation. Compassionate, humane, touching deeply and all the while remaining entertaining and humorous at all times. Masterfully paced. A brilliant conclusion of a 10 year saga. Satisfying and mesmerizing.\\nMusic is a joy to behold. Every place, scene and battle is brought to great heights by Soken\\'s incredible vision and talent.\\nWriting and characters are probably among the best of any game I\\'ve played.\\n\\nAfter the journey here you will be left with feelings and contemplation as to your own. Something only great art can achieve.\\n\\nI can not praise the dev team enough. It is a true joy that such marvels are brought to existence.\\n\\n***\\n\\nIf you are a new player and considering playing the game, I can not recommend this enough. It is a gem mastered carefully with abundance of love, care and talent. It is a slow burner but absolutely worth your time and attention.The best expansion in a mmo with shadowbringers, I can not lower points for people who can not login is something that is solved with the passing of daysSplendid Game! Impressive characters. Philosophical plot design. Thank you SE!Absolute failure of a launch being excused by rabid fanboys who have nothing else to do but to argue and defend a six-billion-dollar corporation because they can\\'t get in the game.\\nQueues even a week later are long, errors remain. Even the worst WoW launch was sorted out 2-3 days later.\\nRating this 0 as I cannot get into a game that I pay MONTHLY FEE for.A truly magnificent game!\\nI really love the story and there are so many great characters in this game.\\nI really hope though that we will see more of Zenos in the future. There still could be so much to discover about him.\\nIf Square Enix ends his story here, some players might think of him as a bit one-dimensional, so I truly hope they will continue using this characer.\\nMaybe he could even get his own redemption arc.\\nAfter all, he just needs to learn how to feel. He probably never made that many positive experiences in his life, so he focused on this one positive feeling he had during the fight with the wol.\\nThere is just so much potential left for Zenos. So I really hope to see more of him.To think, all this time thinking MMOs could only be built as chorelike grinds with horrid story and an even worse community- not every game does it like WoW.\\n\\nInitially, I avoided getting into FFXIV because it looked like \\'just WoW with an FF skin, and I\\'m already invested in WoW and have all this cosmetic stuff\\'- the game is nothing like WoW.\\n\\nThe best part of this game is- the content comes first, and then the grinds come after. They\\'ve flipped the entire genre, you don\\'t grind a dozen things for months just to get the gear and systems needed to be competent enough to do the only fun things in the game- everything in the game is fun, and anything grindy is off to the side that you can do if you like it and want its cosmetics.\\n\\nI hope, after almost two decades of mmos trying to be wow clones and dying because the wow formula is awful unless someone is already addicted- mmos start to look at this \\'content is meant to be fun, not addicting\\' mindset behind FFXIV.\\n\\nThis game restored my faith in a genre that\\'s been decaying under the disgusting team of molesters and criminals running Blizzard.I\\'ve played more MMOs than I can count. FFXIV wins the prize for story, especially the parts authored by  Natsuko Ishikawa. Unlike many JRPGs, these characters are adults with Western facial features and body language confronting complex issues with an uplifting overall theme. Highly recommended for all ages.Shadowbringers was SO good i coudn\\'t hope to see a better FFXIV expansion. They did it. Endwalker is a masterpiece everybody should enjoy and cry withEpic conclusion! Loved it. They made this expansion with love. Can\\'t wait for the next set of story. Added classes is great too. Combat still needs to be faster though.\\n\\nWould like to see another level of graphics (as optional) for higher end PCs.You are the main character of unbelievable story. The game hit me right in the heart.\\nLive through all trials and years to the ultimate finale!\\n- Music connects to the screen perfectly.\\n- Amazing cutscenes, more like full movie experience.\\n- Cute kind community and clubs as part of MMO!I don\\'t know where to start ... this Expansion is such a masterpiece, the Story is so well written, it connects everything together, and it fits so well. In my opinion, the whole story is one of the best I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nThe Dungeons are good designed it fits perfect to the Story, the fights are epic and exciting, the music is so great and fits perfect in every moment. The Areas are beautiful, such as like some Dungeons.\\n\\nI love every aspect of this expansion so much, I can\\'t wait to see what\\'s coming up in the future.Incredible jrpg first, addicting mmo second.\\nEndwalker ends the saga like noone can in current media.\\nMmo part isnt grindy at all, you just play the way you want to, and it is very refreshing to come back every one\\'s in a while and find new things to do)\\nRecomended for every story enjoyer and mmo veteranSince 1997, FFVII has been my favourite Final Fantasy. No longer. Endwalker is a heartwarming, heartrending, sublime cap to the 8-10 year Zodiark/Hydaelyn story and an all-round amazing experience. This game is simply one of the best in the business.Amazing series and the ending of an era.\\nFFXIV makes me so emotional and the story is so touching.\\nI cried out of joy and emotion.\\nEven more, the content of the story rises to the level of philosophy in this expansion.\\nIt\\'s a story that is definitely a miraculous tribute to the life of a man who strives to live.\\nIt\\'s so far the best game/ novel I\\'ve ever seen in my life.This is a great game to play with friends!\\nI\\'d recommend playing this game.I had loft expectations for this game from the masterpiece that was Shadowbringers. Some of the new characters are some of my very favorite ever in this game. The twists and turns you get into, the incredible places you\\'ll visit, the god-tier soundtrack, and a satisfying ending to a 10 year story. There were some gut punches in Shadowbringers, but I think Endwalker delivers some KOs in spades. The new jobs are great and most jobs got some really solid QoL, with more on the way in a month or so.\\n\\nI think if you have been a long time fan of FF and haven\\'t gotten your toes wet with an MMO, now is a good time to start. You\\'ll wish you tried this game sooner.This story is probably the best way Square Enix could have concluded everything that has been set up this decade. Endwalker manages to somehow make a story even more captivating and emotional than Shadowbringers, which I doubted that it\\'d be possible. Gameplay is same-old mostly, with more ease-of-access changes to help clarify some things for new players. Masayoshi Soken is a freaking legend and you can tell by the top-quality soundtrack  you\\'ll be listening as you explore  the beautiful areas it has to offer. Overall masterpiece level content!One of the greatest games I\\'ve had the pleasure of playing. By far the greatest MMO ever, and I can\\'t wait to see where the story goes from hereOne of the best stories ever told in a video game. Surpasses shadowbringers by miles. Easily recommendAmazing dlc. FF14 is by far the best MMO out there and it\\'s not even close. This Dlc was excellent in most aspects and its made me even more exited for FF16.There is nothing more I can say than; this was easily the best expansion I have ever played, be it story-wise or design-wise. Let us embark on the new saga that begins after the conclusion of this epic saga.Just stick with it, the slow burn at start gives for the biggest pay off the rest of the way through right up to the big end.An amazing conclusion to an amazing story in an amazing JRPG game. From music to art and the various theme, it was exceptional, and i even learned life lessons along the way =D\\n\\n10/10A wonderful and satisfying conclusion for this long lasting adventure. Touching and filled with many details and references. Starting slow this expansions story speeds up after a short time and delivers a high quality game with beautiful visuals, music and storytelling.I really like how the game knew how to keep me so far without ever getting tired.4,000 hours of play!\"Shadowbringers\" was highly evaluated, so  I was worried that this work could be connected well and that the foreshadowing could be completed and the finale could be reached.\\nAfter finishing to the end, the BGM and the story were all better than expected and it was the best.\\nWe thank all the staff of FF14 for their efforts.  thank you.Best Game of the Year!Endwalker is a culmination of 10 years of ffxiv!\\nBest game of the year!Endwalker is the outcome of 10 years!Absolutely amazing finish to an amazing game. Thank you Yoshi-P for everything, and here\\'s for more adventures beyond the horizon!perfect storytelling,great graphics,best balanced battles.Definitely,this is the best FF.… ExpandThey set the bar so high up with every expansion that surpasing it for the grand finale would seem impossible, however, they did it, and its a glorious piece of story telling and solid gameplay.There\\'s plenty of laughter and tears along the way, and Endwalker manages to send off the Zodiark and Hydaelyn saga on an incredibly high note. Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is a real crowdpleaser, and it should also leave everyone hopeful for what the future has in store for the MMORPG, even if this expansion is going to be incredibly difficult to top.Hands down the best story of any game I\\'ve ever played. I did not think they could match the quality of Shadowbringers, but they actually somehow blew it away. The new jobs are super fun and the changes to current ones are excellent as well.The expansion came together in a really nice way so far.\\nThe gameplay feels way more fluid, can\\'t tell if it\\'s because of the gcd changes or not.\\nGraphics wise they really improved since Shadowlands, which can be felt on my fps.\\n\\n| SPOILER |\\nFeels like the story of some characters just either got the cut, or the devs were not really sure what to do with them anymore. To mention one, Zenos. I love that character since the first time. They gave him like 10 minutes of screen time in the whole journey? He was supposed to be one of the mayor points of the expansion..\\n| /SPOILER |\\n\\nSo far if Heavensward story is 11/10 then Endwalker is 10/10;\\nSubject to change once we get to 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 etc. etc, hope no one forgot it\\'s far from the end.… ExpandA best ending could possibly think of for the hydaelyn-zodiark story arc. The ups and downs, the high points and no low points, every thing is planned perfectly and gets me without fail. An emotion roller coaster and topped shadowbringers without doubt in terms of story. The ending part starting from hydaelyn, with Emet, Hythlodaeus and the scions coming next, hurts so deep it is incomparable by any other game i played before.\\nIn terms of maps and scenery, Ultima Thule is amazing, literally \"the end of the universe\". The main city for players, old sharleyan is amazing too. Razadhan is good enough, but just doesnt catch me enough.\\nMusic wise, Soken topped himself from Shadowbringers. Almost every single song hits me hard enough when the story goes on, while the ambience songs are perfectly fitted with the map itself.\\nAnd finally, in terms of gameplay, lots of tedious work had been deleted, and most jobs are cleaner then ever. Best FFXIV expansion ever up to date.… ExpandA true masterpiece of videogame story telling with engaging gameplay that builds on 10 years of experience.While the engine may now be dated and the start of the game remains slow, FFXIV is not simply the MMO to play right now but possibly the RPG most worth playing too.This is my best RPG game from my perspective. I have played this game over 8 years, without any doubt, this game is part of my life. although I\\'m very busy sometimes, I often log in this game and visit my house and my company. Yoshida could just end the MSQ in a more ordinary way, but he didn\\'tEndwalker is a phenomenal finale to the big overarching arc building up since ARR.Just wow. Better than Shadowbringers? yes. The best Expansion? yes. Can\\'t wait for the future of this game.Epic, just epic. Endwalker MSQ is all about fan service. Thank you Yoshi and your team, your passion and love towards \\'game\\' and its player base is really there. I cried many times during story line but final cry was because everything just got too overwhelming..Final Fantasy XIV is one of the most important franchise games in Square\\'s history, not only in terms of income, but also because of the value that the Final Fantasy saga itself brings. EndWalker is the culmination of 11 years of hard work, of experimenting with all kinds of mechanics, all kinds of stories and characters, which ultimately deliver the best work the company has put out in the last 20 years. All the characters have their due end, all the villains and everything that we have learned since we joined the Scions of the Seventh Dawn has concluded. Personally, the villain of this expansion was a bit of my duty, but that\\'s mostly because I adored Emeth-Selch as a well-written antagonist in ShadowBringers. From then on, this expansion does not introduce many new things to the lore of the franchise, but rather tries to close the ends of all the subplots that we have lived through. Yes there are new things or rather things that we did not know to date, but everything is an expansion of what was already presented before. The dungeons and trials are the best in the game, with an incredible soundtrack that adds new songs and remixes of what you\\'ve heard before that leaves you tied to the chair. All the classes of the game are very well balanced and all are fun to play, there is no one that is above the other, it depends on the tastes of the player and how they decide their experience to be. The cutscenes have improved a lot compared to those static scenes with emotes that we had in A Realm Reborn. Final Fantasy XIV on a 10/10 as a J-RPG and as an MMORPG. Congratulations and I hope you enjoy the ending as much as I did.The perfect way to end the Hydaelyn and Zodiark story. Somehow they managed to top Shadowbringers.The way they deal with political issues still left me some disappointments. Nevertheless, it was the most perfect finale I\\'ve ever seen.Though there are some minor drawbacks, the MSQ is awesome.\\nI think ENDWALKER is the best expansion with amazing story about love and hope, excellent music and so on.\\nHope to see more!I could tell you the whole story,  and you wouldn\\'t believe me. I mean that in the best way possible.  The writing is creative,  refreshing takes on concepts we\\'ve visited.  Do not story skip and then do this expansion.  It can stand on its own just fine,  but atleast 2 of the 10 points im giving are for the way it makes use of both main story and side content and brings it\\'s world,  and characters,  to a very neat and tidy,  glorious conclusion.  I highly recommend doing side content  from the previous expansions *before* you do this expansion,  job quests too.Shadowbringers expansion was a gaming masterpiece.\\nEndwalker is even better.\\nDev team have added new mechanics, refined some old ones. You can see that they pay close attention to community feedback in all forms, including jokes and memes. They know exactly who you love and why you love them.\\nGenerally Endwalker gives you a huge payoff for nearly 10 years (yes, 10, cause it references some points from 1.0) of existing content.\\nIt might be hard to score it as a separate game, but whole saga has one of the best stories in video games I\\'ve played.One of the best experiences I ever had, full of the exaggerated swagger of a grand Saga Conclusion. Makes you feel like the Warrior of Light. Has a little something for everyone 10/10.Really great game. A true RPG and a complete MMO! Currently a victim of its success but the devs are doing a good job of keeping the quality of play at a high level.Easily the best game I have played, a good finale to a well rounded and incredibly thought out experience. Cannot wait to see where it goes next, the Dev team deserves the world and more.Masterpiece. Plain and simple. Play it, you won\\'t regret it. Didn\\'t think that they can surpass Shadowbringers, but they did it.After completing Shadowbringers, of course I was looking forward to Endwolker.  I was afraid that they would not be able to make the game at the same level, but they were able to stay at the same level.  The script is wonderful, it is a pleasure to play, the graphics and design of the locations are pleasing to the eye.  But at the start of the game there are too few dungeons, I think after a while Endwolker will be overgrown with content, this is inevitable.  But if you play from the start, then there is a very lack of dungeons.  Music: 10 Graphic Design: 10, Scenario: 10, Gameplay 10. Everything is great in this game, but the special admiration is the lighting in the game makes it just incredible, this is the most beautiful lighting, the most beautiful weather conditions that I have ever seen, the lights in  darkness is simply incomparable, and super graphics optimization allows you to play on weak PCs, with such a low polygonality, the game looks like a real Diamond.Best FF14 expansion so far , Yoshida and his team really did it again ! The story is easily one of the best FF story in decade , and the MUSIC !! 11/10Story:\\nSimply a masterpiece, the accumulation and lead up of the story was so carefully thought out. It explored concepts and made me feel stuff I have never experienced in another game. Characters felt real as if I have known then for so long, been through thick and thin with them and formed REAL bonds…I cant make this game justice with just words. However, it is a complete saga, so without the other expansions being experienced the story would definitely not bare the same weight. So i highly recommend you experience the whole game as this is the final arc to this saga. Music:\\nMusic enhances the story in all aspects. It gives weight, value, emotion to pivotal as well as more relaxed moments. It is carefully used and it is clear that a lot of consideration took place for timing story moments to be even more impactful.  I found myself singing all the songs through my day. Also I’ve spent countless hours listening them on repeat. More than once I have found myself saying “damn they paired this song with this moment perfectly”. Music is another aspect that I consider a masterpiece.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nTrials and dungeons were so spectacular, challenging and fun at the same time.\\nGameplay (for Reaper and Paladin at least) felt smooth, fluid and interesting.\\nGame systems dont waste your time and feel rewarding.\\nFun side activities for every type of player.\\nPolished content, bug free.\\n\\nCriticisms:\\nIf I had to nit-pick I would say some quests may be found repetitive at times, however, that doesn’t take away from the experience. At the time of this review the game is suffering from some queue times but as more time passes it get better. Admittedly, I dont blame people for wanting to play this amazing game.\\n\\nTLDR:\\nThis game is a masterpiece, I am glad I was able to experience it and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you don\\'t play it as well!\\nThank you YoshiP and Square Enix dev team! Looking forward to more adventures in Eorzea for years to come.Absolutely Astonishing. Even with the login congestion, once you get in the game, you are treated to a masterpiece of a story. Never knew a game\\'s story can be this great particularly in an MMO genre.Arguably the best expansion yet. The story is pretty straightforward, it\\'s very easy to understand. A massive improvement in terms of gameplay mechanics in dungeons and boss fights. Some roles/jobs have also been improved.… ExpandStory 5/5, I don\\'t know how they just topped Shadowbringers. Every zone just has a story of its own, and they all just tie together the journeys that the Warrior of Light had.\\n\\nMusic & Sounds 5/5. I thought that \"To the Edge\" of Shadowbringers (5.3) would be the only song to give me goosebumps. The music in the story, dungeons, and trials are all so excellent. Final trial battle boss sounds are just so epic. I wish they had introduced original songs in the optional dungeons however.\\n\\nBecause of how good this game is, I made a metacritic account just for this.This is the endgame of mmorpgs. Would be difficult to find something better than this as an MMORPG.Wonderful Game for now and mmo.No bugs in the plot.All the ambush stories form a closed loop,make 么 so exciting.I think story is better than ever.So, after a long-ass time, we finally get the ending to this main arc of a story, a story that many seem to consider the staple of jrpg and one of the best stories ever written, on par with the classics. Or so they say.\\n\\nNow I won\\'t really go much into details for obvious reasons, but all I can say about the game itself is that \"if you played all the previous expansions, you played this one as well\", which is the following\\n\\n- You level up\\n- You do the daily\\n- Gather 450  weekly tomestomes that everyone loves to be gatekept on\\n- Do it again next week until your gear becomes obsolete.\\n\\nSounds fun? Well, apparently it is considering it\\'s been like this since Heavensward but people seem to not notice that the game has been doing the same thing since then. I literally could say a lot of things that they recycled and I would still be denied. What a great community!\\nAlthough in their defense they did try some new things, like POTD 1 and 2 (called Heaven on High) or Eureka 1 and 2 (called Bosia...bozhia....bozja? Eureka 2). And guess what? THEY ALL FREAKING SUCKED!\\n\\nAnyway, I would love to rant more about the game itself but honestly, I\\'d love to talk about the story, mainly because it\\'s always considered the biggest quality and apparently it\\'s considered so good that it\\'s creating an example. And frankly, I don\\'t get why considering it\\'s once again one of the most average stories ever created, and after playing the main story I\\'m also kind of unsure why, especially when the final boss of the game is literally an enemy you meet for a tenth of the game\\'s running time vs another famous enemy that\\'s been teased for A DECADE.\\n\\nBut really, I just don\\'t understand what\\'s so good about it: it\\'s the generic power fantasy where you beat the bad guys, with a roster of characters that you either care or don\\'t, and get through the end. I don\\'t see the greatness when other jrpgs been doing this before and much better. If people like it I guess good, but a staple of jrpg stories? I mean yeah, some scenes were impressive, but considering that the cutscenes are made cheaply it\\'s hard to get invested. Some cutscenes were good but good isn\\'t enough for a game that\\'s considered \"The best story was ever written\" or something. I enjoyed it but once I finished it I completely forgot about it, it\\'s that generic.\\n\\nBottom line, it\\'s an OKAY story, but it\\'s the same exact expansion as the previous one when it comes to gameplay, and as of this review 6.2 is coming this late august which I already know what\\'s gonna bring, which is more gear that will make your old gear obsolete, one single dungeon that\\'ll become repetitive after the first time, and other minor additions that might get forgotten soon. Although maybe we might get harder dungeons so that\\'s a positive but I\\'m holding my hype.\\n\\nIt\\'s an okay ending at least, but definitely not one of the best stories ever. Just no.… ExpandA masterpiece. I didn\\'t think that the Shadowbringers expansion could be beat but I was clearly wrong. Incredible story that took me through twists and turns.I adored ShB. EW did not feel like the spiritual successor to it, in fact, if I didn\\'t know better I would\\'ve thought it was a different MSQ writer due not only to inconsistencies, contradictions, and outright retcons, but undermining the elements I loved about the ShB story.\\n\\nI came away from EW feeling like I\\'m not ethically on the same page as the writers. The narrative thematically was like an interactive self help book full of \\'how to deal with despair\\' platitudes. Overall, if I had to sum up EW it\\'d be r/im14andthisisdeep: the expansion. It makes the brilliance of ShB appear to be a fluke.One of the greatest tales ever told gets its perfect ending. Creative Business Unit 3 somehow exceeded their lofty expectations, a feat impressive by any standards, but especially so considering it’s predecessor, Shadowbringers, was considered one of the greatest video game expansions ever. That crown now goes to Endwalker. From an exceptional soundtrack, tight cinematography, masterful writing, immersive voice acting, and white-knuckle boss encounters, Endwalker is at the top of its class. The dungeons and boss fights are filled with spectacular set pieces, only made even more grandiose by the high stakes the story sets and the masterful musical orchestration. It’s no small feat to wrap up a story almost a decade in the making, but they somehow do so in a cathartic way. Endwalker is packed full of satisfying plot conclusions, moments of tranquility and despair, heartwarming and tasteful call backs, and story written with the purest of heart. With well over 60 hours of story telling and content, Endwalker leaves nothing undone, nothing unsaid, and misses no beats. It starts slow and builds up to a deafening crescendo, unfolding and revealing its mysteries 10 years in the making.Endwalker and the FFXIV saga is simply a masterpiece that is almost mandatory for those who love MMO’s, RPGs, and world class story telling.This is a fantastic capstone from the story and franchise that they have labored to nurture these last 8 years.  They have a wonderful and well balanced selection of previous story characters and have helped the Main Story Quest so that it is more cutscene focused than fetch quest.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of negativity about the queue times but the game has really exploded in popularity in the last couple years especially in the last 6 months.  They mentioned that they knew the queue times would be an issue but with the supply chain issues we have had for the last two years its hard to get access to additional hardware.  When queues die down and everyone is playing casually again it will be an amazing story and adventure for all.One of the best stories of the entire Final Fantasy franchise. The internet is gushing about this game for a reason.\\n\\nWhere some other games can get weaker as time goes on, FFXIV has only grown stronger into an absolute juggernaut. The writing, area design, encounters, music, everything - I can hardly put into words how wonderful it is.Deeply emotional story.\\nEvery music track kicks in at the right moment.\\nI can only hope that someday the developers will be able to completely untie it from online, so that the game will forever remain in history and everyone can enjoy it.In my opinion this expansion surpassed Shadowbringers. Best expansion so far.\\nStory, music, duties, maps. Everything is just so good.\\nBest Final Fantasy game ever.Compared to ShB it is definitely more flawed, but at the same time it also reaches far higher peaks. Giving it a perfect score because in the end it really sticks the landing. And that is not something i can take for granted, for i can\\'t even remember the last time i saw this happen with a story of this size. A fantastic end to an epic tale.This expansion exceeded all my expectations. no wonder this is one of the best MMOs ever made, you can feel the love and passion the team behind this have for the game.\"Shadowbringers was amazing, but there\\'s no way they could top it.\" - You, me, and every other fan of the game.\\n\\nThank goodness we were absolutely wrong. THIS is how you wrap up a 10 year long story. All the pieces of the puzzle, even all the way back in ARR, finally come together to tell the finale in a legendary ending. This isn\\'t just the best story to ever be told in a MMO, it\\'s one of my favorite RPG\\'s of all time. From the music, the cut scenes, the gameplay, and the community, FFXIV has managed to make what feels like an impossible dream come to life.\\n\\n\"We too are miracles, each and every one of us. Born of the warm breath of life that traverses the heavens, swirling through eternity. When I fully grasped the improbability of our existence, nothing felt impossible any more. If it could be imagined, it could be done.\"… ExpandThis is easily the greatest game I\\'ve ever played. It made me feel and experience things that I didn\\'t think possible. Two words perfectly describe this: Masterpiece & GloriousThe queue are long, but once you are in everything is smooth. 0 bugs, 0 crashes, 0 lag. They really nailed it as usualA great finale to the Hydaelyn and Zodiark gran saga. Definitely worth it if you invest a lot of the time on the msq and also the side content stories like the raid and alliance. Progression of the story feels so much smoother aside from some \" follow someone \" quest. Music wise is SUPERB as expected and the dungeon design is so much colorful and detail compare to previous expansion. Overall a solid 10/10.This is the best expansion of all time, i \\'d say of all games. Honestly...they overcome themselves.\\nFinal Fantasy XIV its not just a game...its a philosophical journey.  The best community ever, the best  MMORPG ever made. The best time to play is now! :)\\nCongratulations Yoshi Team!This game, this game expansion was such a lifelong experience, I can\\'t even put into words. Everything, the music, the cutscenes, the interactions with characters, the duties, the dungeons, the trials, the zones feel carefully crafted with love and passion. I can\\'t recommend it enough. Yes the queues are long but if you have the patience to wait for it, you will be not disappointed.\\nSimply put: I just love this game.Moving scenes, nice animation, perfect characters, and exciting music. I like everything about this. Thank you Yoshida and Ishikawa. My tears will tell you everythingI like the story of this game, which brings me a lot of joy and tears.\\nThere are also many details and small ideas in the game.They did what many of us thought was a difficult task, they exceeded all expectations they went farther than Shadowbringers, it\\'s a beautiful and emotional history that is worth experiencing, from the music, the environments the dungeons, and trials. Yes, they had issues with the servers due to a huge amount of players, but I don\\'t think that single thing can eclipse this masterpiece.For me, Endwalker is the greatest video game story ever told. I really didn’t think they could top Shadowbringers, but they did. Literally my favourite video game ever.I... was afraid when I began this expansion. Afraid that it couldn\\'t live up to it\\'s predecessor.\\nBut, it did. It\\'s an wonderful capstone to a journey which has spanned nearly a decade of my life. Fighting through the queues of people who so desperately wanted to play, nudging aside the unease of certain moments and pushing through my rather bad habit of putting off endings, it was worth it. Endwalker is..really good. The music, yes, which is guaranteed to be good because Soken created it. But the story is wonderful. It feels like giving it anything less than a ten would be disrespectful.One of the best JRPG/RPG/MMORPG and Final Fantasy ever made, Endwalker was crafted by a talented team able to make incredible stories, music, and animations with Yoshi-P at the helm.\\n\\nThe story was so amazing that I teared up several times and was able to making me feel several strong emotions. Emotions that blew up thanks to the sublime conclusion of a story arc that has been going since 2010.\\n\\nOn the wings of Final Fantasy games, FFXIV not only is able to please long time fans of the series playing FF games since 1987, making this game a theme park mmorpg, it moves the series forward as a standalone rpg/jrpg, making the rpg part in \"mmo\" a reality.\\n\\nEndwalker can be considered the culmination of a masterpiece. And as many masterpieces in art, be music, story, painting, drawings and so on once you reach the end it leaves you in shambles crying, and a feeling of emptiness. But in my heart I know that this is just the beginning for FFXIV, the story will move forward and I\\'m eager and excited to see what this amazing team will be able to let us embark on.\\n\\nFFXIV is a love relationship between players and devs, players and creators, devs and creators, I want to say thank you to Yoshi-P, the ffxiv team and the community (most of it at least) for this amazing experience from the bottom of my heart. It gives me hope for the future of Final Fantasy but even more so for the real world, thanks to the messages that the story delivers to the players. A message of hope, bonds, friendship and strength.',\n",
       " 'The controls are great, the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is relentlessly fun. Vanquish is a great game for those looking for an adrenaline rush; a rush it is coming in at just over 5 hours long on Normal difficulty. The story is pretty poor; Russian evil dude wants to destroy USA etc... it\\'s been done a million times before. Most male characters have a rough accent and at times annoying and over the top dramatic. Nonetheless, it\\'s a decent game and I had fun playing and I\\'m glad I rented it.  The graphics are good in the sense of large environments and the particle effects are good as are the characters models. The let downs are the length and the story, the best bits are the gameplay and levels. 3/5.Vanquish is a game that doesn\\'t focus on trying to tell a story. It doesn\\'t focus on trying to create an immersive world. It doesn\\'t even concentrate on making good characters. What Vanquish strives to accomplish is to create an absolutely high octane adrenaline fueled shooting fest using fast paced gameplay, awesome bosses, and constant gameplay change ups to keep the game fresh and fun. Ultimately, it accomplishes this goal, but when you look at Vanquish outside of the core game mechanics, it\\'s revealed to be a very hollow experience.\\n\\nVanquish, despite it\\'s flaws, gets one thing right for the most part, and that\\'s the gameplay, which centers around your character, Sam, who has been fitted with an Augmented Reaction suit, which enhances his abilities and gives him new ones. With the AR suit, Sam is more durable, can boost and slide at fast speeds, has more strength, and increased agility. He even has an ability called AR mode, which allows Sam to slow time around him, allowing you to line up shots while boosting, dodging, or save yourself when you\\'re in danger. The controls for this game are perfect. Despite all the room for error with the control scheme, you\\'re always in perfect control of Sam, what he\\'s doing, and how he\\'s doing it. It\\'s really impressive that Vanquish lets you have so much control over such a fast character.\\n\\nMore impressive is the amount of effort put in to make sure the game doesn\\'t become stale. Throughout the game, there are multiple change-ups, including things like Anti-gravity segments, sniping sections, turret gameplay, and many more variations that keep the gameplay fresh. The bosses and mini bosses are epic and are designed to center around the AR mode gameplay, where you have to slow down time to line up the perfect shot on specific weak points. Even the quick time event finishers used on recycled bosses are different in an attempt to make every battle with one feel unique in it\\'s own way.\\n\\nThe gameplay is the one thing Vanquish got right, which is why it\\'s all the more surprising to see just how much less effort is invested into the rest of the game. For starters, the story is a complete joke. Set in a futuristic Earth setting centering around Russia trying to dominate the world through technical warfare, Sam is sent in along with the military as a mercenary to help the American marines, which is a simple premise that works but falls apart when the story tries to be more complicated than it needs to. The whole conspiracy revealed near the end of the game feels shoe horned in, trying to create a more complicated narrative in a title that just has no real place for one. The subplot centering on Sam and his relationship with a high ranking Marine named Burns is somewhat interesting and tries to touch on some morality issues, but it ultimately doesn\\'t amount to anything. Even the final interaction between Sam and Burns feels strange and out of place and feels like an attempt to make your care about a character that you really have no reason to.\\n\\nThe story is just the start for a few problems. There are plenty of cheap attacks from enemies that one shot you or send you into a near death state, which become way more frequent as the game progresses. This also highlights a flaw in the AR mode, where every action centering around the suit - melee, boosting, and AR mode - uses fuel cells. They recharge fast but need to cool down if completely used. The main problem with this method is that there\\'s no manual button to turn AR mode on or off, so when you take cover after going into a near death state, AR mode continues to deplete your fuel cells all the way to the end, causing a cool-down, and as the game becomes more cheap and difficult, it makes all the abilities provided by fuel cells less ideal in areas where you need them the most. You\\'ll just end up shooting a few bullets at a time from cover instead of boosting everywhere like the game is meant to on the later levels.\\n\\nThe last thing this game gets wrong is the sheer lack of any replay value. There are upgrades to be picked up in the field, but they only increase the max capacity of your currently selected weapon. There\\'s no upgrade to increase your health, fuel cells, or the max amount of melee attacks you can do. The abilities you start the game with are the ones you\\'ll end the game with, meaning there\\'s no real new game plus. There are challenges and extras, but there\\'s no real reason to play the game a second time after your first playthrough.\\n\\nDespite the solid gameplay mechanics, Vanquish\\'s lack of anything else substantial is what sets it back. In all honesty, I recommend that you borrow this game from a friend, rent it, or buy it for cheap, and that\\'s because you\\'ll have an awesome playthrough on the first go, and have no reason to return to it afterword.Repetitive and over the top, some interesting mechanics but overall a mindless linear shooter. It\\'s like Gears of War combined with Devil May Cry - which might be a good thing if you\\'re into such games.This game has a slightly embarrassing, overly-macho plot. It\\'s pretty short. It\\'s a good thing every second of gameplay is sheer adrenaline and fun.Basically,  Vanquish is a second-person cover shooter, where you can dash at incredible speeds to find new cover (which is constantly being destroyed), and enter bullet-time to dodge the ridiculous hail of gunfire. There is no padding, just lots of amazing gameplay. Don\\'t listen to the haters here. I much preferred this game to Gears of War, and I liked Gears of War. If you\\'ve ever liked a shooter, pick up Vanquish. It\\'s available for a good price, and every set-piece is memorable.I don\\'t understand why the reviews for this game are so low. Yes, the game is on the short side but so are many more games. To me the only problem with the game is that it was so good it left me wanting more. This is seen as the only major issue the game has, but still during the 6-7 hours the game takes to complete you will be in pure shooter nirvana. The great graphics, the welcomed difficulty and the overall sense of mayhem makes this game one of the years best games on the PS3.I\\'m in love with Vanquish. It mashes together everything a hardcore gamer could want: intuitive controls, mobility, balance, a competitive scoring system, and stylized action. ItâIt may not have had the hype of some of the forthcoming big name games but, make no mistake Vanquish one of the most exciting PS3 action games this year. Challenging, innovative and when it\\'s at it\\'s best genuinely thrilling.Vanquish reminds me of what it felt like as a kid to play the newest and coolest arcade games in the late 80\\'s and early 90\\'s that SEGA made.  I\\'m talking about those big cabinet games that moved around like After Burner and cost $1 to play.  Every second of this game is fun fun fun.  The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay addicting because the control mechanics are TOP NOTCH.   I suggest going through the last couple tutorials before starting but after that, it\\'s all second nature.   The story behind the game is simple, but a lot of fun..again it\\'s a throw back of the corny but cool characters in arcade games back in it\\'s golden era before the home market caught up and became superior over the coin-ops.    There are 2 demos on the PSN right now..  I played them for about an hour before grabbing my jacket to go to the store to pick this game up.   Nowadays games have to be at least 10 hours of gameplay for some to bother but there is a lot more to offer here.  The game makes you want to improve on all your stats because it\\'s so addicting.  Playing through it you start thinking, I bet I could get through this faster next time if I throw my grenades here first, wait to blow up the exploding barrel here, and take cover here.   One of the demos is a timed challenge, this is what did it for me, besides the amazingly awesome WOW moments that\\'s in the campaign.  Think God of War with kick-ass guns, only you\\'re not Kratos, you\\'re a regular average good guy in an awesome accelerator suit from a bad movie. (GI JOE)  Also if there are any Bayonetta fans out there, as I was, Vanquish is better.Vanquish is a stylish game with endless fun potential. Its a great change of pace from the everyday shooter clones on the market. It has none stop action and amazing graphics that never make the frame rate drop even with everything exploding all around you. I highly recommend this to anyone that just wants a fun none stop action shooter.This game is simply amazing.  It takes all the standards of cover based TPS and turns them on their head to create a new experience in a genre that is rapidly becoming driven into the ground.  Sure, there is cover in this game but you will only spend mere seconds at a time in it to restore your power-suit\\'s energy.  The rest of the time will be spent using said energy to perform maneuvers that elevate Vanquish\\'s \"standard gameplay\" to something that looks like a meticulously choreographed cut-scene of your own design.  The two techniques that use suit energy are rocket sliding and slowing time (triggered primarily by dodge rolling into an aiming position), and the rapid juxtaposition of the two is highly encouraged.  Both of these techniques are actually far more effective in preventing damage than cover is, and both are highly aggressive maneuvers.  However, the suit doesn\\'t carry much energy with a stiff penalty for ever exhausting it completely--but on the upside it does recharge very rapidly.  Thus Vanquish\\'s perfect **** of insane speeds, dodge rolls with jaw dropping head shots attached, and cover mechanics is born.  Not to mention there are many maneuvers the game never tells you about that are guaranteed to raise a smile (IE the melee during a dash allows you to kick off an enemy\\'s chest into an aerial slow-mo aim to head shot his friends, or that you can trigger slow-mo during a slide/vaulting over cover/flipkicking enemies into the air) that the player must discover through experimentation to keep you learning all the great things you can do with suit energy.  Levels won\\'t cease to amaze you until the game is over, with new set pieces that crop up everywhere.  The game is short, but the replay value will come from the gameplay--like a Devil May Cry game this game is begging to be played harder, faster, and more stylishly as your skills increase.  For anyone who is a fan of TPS or Japanese-style action gaming this is about as good as it gets.  I will say the story is a wreck of B-movie self-indulgent dialogue and sometimes appears as self-parody, but I don\\'t think that should stop any gamer from experiencing the amazing game play to be found in this title.Vanquish is a one of a kind, its unique and is totally different from other third person shooting games. It never gets boring as the gameplay is fun because you feel so powerful and fast, and the game throws something big at you out of the blue which makes your heart pump. In the game, you take contol of Sam Gideon in the futuristic world, who wears a special suit called A.R.S, which has the ability to boost with amazing ecceleration and speed, slow mo to help you destory your robots enemies to pieces and you can also melee, but make sure not to over use these ability as your suit will overheat meaning you have to wait for it to recharge. You can hide behind objects to cover and shoot but thats not the fun way to play the game, JUST BOOOOOST!!! The game takes around 7 hours to complete.The game doesn\\'t have multiplayer, but that doesn\\'t mean it doesn\\'t have replay value, after each act you unlock challenge mode which is one of the most addicting mode I have ever played, challenge mode will take you a while to complete as it is bloody hard!I have been playing Vanquish for a little over two years.  Such is the appeal of Shinji Mikami masterpiece, I just keep coming back to it.\\n\\nVanquish is a polished gem of a game.  Everything is rock solid, no glitches, no bugs no crashes.  The game inspires confidence as soon as you see these beautiful graphics.  And they are beautiful.   Real care and attention has been  placed on all aspects bun none more so than the Battle Suit.  There are so many moving parts and flashing lights, it is a treat to look at and often worth a camera spin to see just how good it looks.  Weapons morph into existence as extensions of the suit and are generated so beautifully they deserve a special mention.\\n\\nThe gameplay is solid. It feels very retro, in the style of Mega Man.  You feel overpowered with the control you have over the character as the controls are that good, but it\\'s not long before your control is tested to the max.  Once you get past the learning curve it really does become second nature  to operate the suit in a heartbeat.\\n\\nThe difficulty of Vanquish is fantastic.  Choose casual and it really is just that.  The suit will look after you and the enemies go down like flies.  Hard is the path to choose.  Trophies are rewarded for completing each level and eventually the game by choosing hard mode.  Each Boss has a trick to it just like great retro games of old one you uncover the trick it is a matter of execution.  Like I said the difficulty if perfect.\\n\\nScoring is done in the old Sega arcade style over Stages and Acts and scores are posted to an online leaderboard   This constitutes the only online aspect of the game and Vanquish is better off for it.\\n\\nAs you beat the game Tactical Challenges game mode will become unlocked.  These are by far the most challenging aspects of the game.  The sixth and final challenge is by far one of the most difficult aspects of any game I have played.  Based on this challenge only, PS3trophies.org ramped the difficulty level for the Platinum to 9.5 out of 10.  So again worth a special mention for those looking for a challenge.\\n\\nVanquish is a truly sensational game and one that you will keep coming back to.  Most people I know are put off by the frantic nature of it but believe me it is so smooth and solid that once you get used to the overload it is a thing of beauty.  The best game from developers Platinum Games in this reviewers opinion.  And it features the single best credits screen of any game.yes its a tad short but this game is seriously good fun the action is fast and frantic the weapons are interesting.the boss fights are pretty cool too if you like third person shooters this will stave off the hunger for gears 3.one complaint no multiplayer.Love this game easily one I the best 3rd person Shooters on the ps3, with shinJi Mikamo you cannot go wrong. Stunning, fast paced graphics, coupled with high octane gun fights, this game didn\\'t sell well, shocks really as people should bite the bullet and pick it up.The only thing that knocks this game down from a ten was the first couple of hours of the story.  A bit too cheesy and derivative, but I did warm up to it as I played.  As for the action, level design, and enemy design...  Just wow.  I played this game through on Hard and died over and over and over again.  But I kept coming back to it.  Because when you die, you feel like, if I just did that instead, maybe I wouldn\\'t have.  It makes Gears of War and Halo seem down right sluggish.  This game is available for free right now on Playstation Plus, a great way to play this game if you haven\\'t.Bought this game along time ago. I will just say that this game is underrated, I think this game sold under a million copies in which I doubt they will make another one. It\\'s  a shame because this game was unique and it seems that people just want mor of the same crap and then complain afterwards. If you guys want different games that are unique you will have to go out and buy games like this, if not we will be forced to play Call of Duty style games forever. That is another thing I don\\'t understand, How can Call of Duty get a good score and how to people get manipulated into buying the most generic shooter ever created? Pretty soon you will buy a different game and Call of Duty will be in the box... you can\\'t escape it. And you just know that the \"pro\" reviews are dirty because it\\'s funny how they can give some games a bad review for being the same thing as the previous, but every year Call of Duty seems to get an awesome mark from them, and that game never changes and it sucks. I guess this is more of a rant on Call of Duty...lol\\nBuy this gameVanquish is a mediocre game overall. Sure it feels amazing in its first hour or so, but after that the novelty of the fast gameplay fades away, the game runs out of ideas and becomes repetitive and cliche\\' as hell. Plot, setting and characters are far worse than the myriad macho movies from the 80s/90s. And let\\'s not forget the subpar performance of this game on PS3/Xbox 360, with the 30 fps target being dropped quite constantly. The low resolution of 1024X720 hides many of the game\\'s artefacts (low quality shadows and such), so I don\\'t consider this as an issue.Amazing gameplay, good graphics, believable character models and expressions, extra challenges for those who want more ... Where is my goddamn sequel?!Vanquish\\ndon’t believe the hype\\nVanquish is a 7 hour long 3rd person shooter where you play as agent Sam with a sick augmented reaction suit.\\nRussia destroys San Francisco with a solar beam and demands the United States surrenders before they do the same to New York and you set out to stop this.\\nBefore you do play this game, I need to bring you back down to reality, because this is not some hidden gem classic that everyone on the internet makes it out to be…\\nDon’t get me wrong… Vanquish is a really fun game...\\nThe shooting feels great, you can slide around on the ground for slow motion shots or just move around maps faster…\\nAnd when you take too much damage the game will go into slow motion allowing you to find cover or have a better shot at taking out the enemy before you die\\nWhich makes for some pretty epic feeling gun play…\\nAnd the best part of this game is the guns and their upgrades…\\nThere’s a huge variety of weapons here to find what you like best...\\nYou can carry up to 3 weapons at a time plus grenades, and enemies will randomly drop upgrades that you can assigned to your favorite weapon to increase its stats instantly..\\nThe game doesn’t slow you down my making you go into some skill tree, no...

I am a big fan of mecha/gundam/guyver and robotech. I was skeptical thinking that this is another mediocre game but I am very surprised with the presentation of Vanquish. Nonstop shootin\\' guns blazin\\' challengin\\' enemies is what makes this game memorable.Second transformation of boss mechas after a hideous battle really pushed my overdrive mode  to \"rape that big boss in the a**!\" I am out of words.lol.Vanquish 10/10Buy this game and make sure to bring extra sodas cuz u r in for a thrill ride. Bring sum weed too. Peace out!amazing graphics and visuals, great characters and a nice story. but the real great thing about vanquish is the game play everything about it is good, one of the best shooters out there. the story might be short but with the scoring system and god hard mode unlocked after you beat the game it has more than enough replayability to be totally worth it.Really good fun. Awesome shooting mechanics, slow motion works really well and the animation for changing guns is the coolest I\\'ve ever seen. The only problem is that it gets a bit repetitive. However, don\\'t let that put you off buying this amazing game.Its only fault is being so much on the short side... Game is just so much fun! The action is really engaging, the weapons are satisfying to shoot, it\\'s a joy to simply move around the scenery making use of the crazy amour. The voice acting is quite good as well, it\\'s a shame that the lines itself are pure cheese. The story is generic and somewhat substandard, but it\\'s not intrusive to game-play: cut-scenes are pretty short and can be skipped. Overall, excellent game where its only drawback is that there is not more of it. But there comes the replay value, I guess. You will want to play it more.My favourite game of 2010, hands down. After first dismissing early vague screenshots, I quickly realised the error of my ways. Shinji Mikami. Platinum Games. This game wasn\\'t just a Dark Void-esque Gears throwback, it was a cleverly packaged homage to Probotector, Space Harrier et al; merciless shooters of yesteryear. The game BLEEDS style. The Guyver crossed with Iron Man tearing up some anime surplus mech warehouse in space. Presentation is slick, with bold sharp graphics and an eye for detail. A great soundtrack accompanies the tightest 3rd-person shooter controls available, providing intense skilful gameplay. The story is short and uninspired, but that\\'s ok; you only came for the fireworks anyway.Ecstatic action made by Shinji Mikami of Resident Evil, Dino Crisis and Devil May Cry fame, shining with the quality and atmosphere one could expect from such a talented developer as Platinum Games. It comes with most of the clichés you\\'d expect from a shooter: turrets, on-rail vehicles, epic bosses etc. The levels have just enough variety to keep me interested, and some characters have the cool overstated features of animé badasses. It ends suddenly after five \"acts\" which has me feeling they cut out the finale. But Vanquish is still a bit like pizza: it\\'s short but well rounded, every bite is equally tasteful, and it has much flavor despite the familiar graphical presentation. Vanquish offers a fair challenge, and is mostly well balanced without frustrating difficulty spikes. Sure, I died more than 30 times during the campaign on \\'normal\\', but save points are spread fairly throughout the game, so it\\'s easy to jump back in and give it another go. The very fluid and fast controls reminds me of Dark Souls, and the game also reminds me of Metal Gear Solid and animé action in the way it all seems so imaginative and potent, brimming with playfulness underneath the Gears of War imitation. The plot feels pointless and I don\\'t feel enriched or amazed after playing it. But it\\'s outstanding action gameplay. The added online rankings (both global and friend list) add a touch of arcade machine. The SEGA logo made me think of Sonic and the effortless fun of early arcade games. I\\'m glad to say the gameplay fully lives up to both that logo and to the nostalgia I connect it with. It could get a better score, but I\\'ll reserve the high marks for totally unique, thoughtful games.\\n\\n(I gave it a 7 but kept playing for the fun trophies and challenges which improved play-time with more than a few hours. The only other game I have so gladly stayed with for achievements was Rayman Legends. The optional Japanese voice-track helps keep the game fresh on replays, and the open design of the arenas make for different strategies and scenarios so each time has variety.)This game doesn\\'t have the best story or the best graphics but it achieves something way better. It is just plainly fun and you\\'ll keep wanting for more. Also, the controls and the weapons are great. The game isn\\'t that long (maybe around 7-8 hours, don\\'t remember exactly) but you\\'ll have no problem starting another game and doing it again.It\\'s Gears of War with Robots, Bullet Time, and Metal Gear Rising QTE\\'s\\n\\nFeels a bit like Warhammer 40K Space Marine too, whereas you\\'re walking around some giant area waiting for another horde of bots to show up or be airdropped in for you to shoot\\n\\nAnd of course, there\\'s the pop up shooting gallery that makes up most of the game, where either you glue yourself beneath some barricade while the other guy shoots at you, and then you do the exact same thing\\n\\nwhoopeeVanquish is the definition of a great video game--fun, frantic, and challenging. No, it does not have great depth in its exaggerated (and admittedly fun) characters or the story they tell. No, you can\\'t customize your weapons or armor how you like. No, unfortunately it is not very long. It does, however, give you over-the-top action that doesn\\'t cease from start to finish. The levels are diverse in their design and approach. The gameplay is perfected in its tight controls and furious mechanics. You will love it from the first minute to the last. Quality over quantity: Vanquish delivers that.Plenty of pride went into making Vanquish. It\\'s a fast, exciting, 3rd person shooter that doesn\\'t take itself too seriously. It should take 6+ hours to beat. I really enjoyed the game and taking down waves of enemies and bosses.\\n\\nLikes - Smooth, reactive, fast gameplay. Characters and story. Humor. Good Mechanics.\\nDislikes- Weapon upgrade system. Fight plenty of grunts.Players control Sam Gideon, a DARPA agent armed with the Augmented Reaction Suit. If the player takes too much damage, the suit will automatically enter Augmented Reaction (AR) mode. AR mode increases Sam\\'s reflexes tenfold, essentially slowing down time for Sam to evade attacks. The player can also manually enter AR mode by holding down the aim button while evading, sliding, or vaulting over cover, allowing the player to target enemies (and their weak spots) easily.This is a hilariously over the top fast paced action shooter.\\n\\nThe cut scenes are like a cheesy 80s action film or like a poorly translated Manga movie.\\n\\nI loved very second of this game for a variety of reasons. Great stuff.Vanquish is simply amazing. This game is a genuine classic. Its the devil may cry of third person shooters, with fast and stylish gameplay. Although the game is short enough and the plot wont win any awards, it doesn\\'t matter. Platinum games are the best game developers of all time and have cemented that place with this game. Fingers crossed for a sequel.Party like it\\'s 1999! At least that is what you think you may be playing. An old Sega Dreamcast game with Next-Gen graphics. Vanquish is one of those rare games they don\\'t make anymore. It is one of those games that you most likely will either love, or trade in for Call of Duty titles. It is definetly not for weak hearted, short-spanned gamer out there. Trophy hunters need not apply. You\\'re going to have a blast playing Vanquish. It is a great mix of Bayonetta, Lost Planet, and Virtual-On. So, if you did not like any of those, turn away right now. Graphics are fairly solid. Framerate keeps up pretty good 90% of the time, and the gameplay is just as smooth. It has crazy amount of action on screen, and it leaves you no room to breathe. Boss battles are awesome and challenging. The sound is good, but music is your typical ambient arcade music. Typical SEGA. Also this is not a long game. Less than average but on par with Call of Duty playtime of 4-6 hours. I would love to have seen some DLC for this game. It is one of those rare games you actually want to buy DLC for, but do not have it. Also no MP hurts replayability. CO-OP would have been a bug plus. Overall a must buy for hardcore gamers, and fans of Shinji Mikami\\'s titles. Lack of replayability is the only downside to an overall classic that is of the dying breed.This is definitely the best third person cover-shooter I have played. Forget that gears of war crap, it\\'s slow and clunky and the characters have no charisma. Vanquish is incredible.Could have got much better score from me, probably even a GOTY award from me if it wouldn\\'t have some problems. Never saw annoying lags and bugs, great looking graphics, controls are good if not counting, that you can do evade move only in four dircetions. What problems in this game? Well, first of all, I completed this game on hard in 4 hours, giving you \\'\\' What? Did I already completed this game? \\'\\' feeling. Even though completing this game gives you a God Hard difficulty option, it doesn\\'t save you from the feeling. For second problem, the end section of the game. At the final sections of the game, you will face boss battles, repeatedly. Worst of all, boss enemies which you had faced before, you will need to fight againts them, again, again and again. It just gets annoying when almost every fight is againts bosses, making you bored. Buy this only when it gets cheaper.Mmm, i thought it looked a bit grainy??? Re release in HD please. Incredible macho snake talking nonsense but enjoyable in places. Repetitive. Repetitive. Repetitive.I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t enjoy this game one little bit. This is like a really pointless hack n slash game. Going around shooting the same robots, over and over and over and over and over again. And the so called bosses are the same over and over and over and over again it gets very boring, very quickly. There is no customisation to either weapons or suit (increasing mag size is a joke). I\\'ve almost completed it but its taken every ounce of my being to get this far; for me its like going to the dentist to have a tooth taken out but have to endure the pain without local anaesthetic.    I respect that some  people enjoyed it but didn\\'t.This game\\'s shooter mechanics are average or acceptable. The concept of a man in a spacesuit with a gun has been done before. The graphics are very good. I wasn\\'t excited to play this and I had never heard about it before. The game engine felt borrowed from another game. Nothing stood out about this game, and the difficulty was very high. It was more overwhelming than being an addictive or fun experience. I can\\'t really recommend this over Lost Planet or Gears of War which are more interesting, but this game seems just OK.I\\'m not about to argue that Vanquish isn\\'t fun, it is, it is tons of fun and stylish to boot. The story is inconsequential but that\\'s cool, I don\\'t mind if the gameplay is there, which it is. But at the same time, I am absolutely shocked at all the brilliant reviews it has been receiving for one reason. It has the life span of a three course meal at a restaurant, you can hire the game and if you have excellent shooting chops, blow through it in four hours straight on the hardest difficulty. I don\\'t mind the exclusion of multiplayer as it has become rather trendy of late and often feels tacked on instead of properly worked with and wouldn\\'t fit within the element of the title. I do mind that it has next to no re-playability. You\\'d think in a world of 40 hour open world games and engrossing, linear epics like Uncharted the developer could have at least found a way to make the ride last longer, even it it was just to include a stack of challenge modes eg. Timesplitters. In conclusion, it could have been brilliant, but I see a high score as a recommendation to buy, and I wouldn\\'t buy this title, it\\'s a fun rental for a night and that is all.I do not have to say anything more. But i need to write one hundred and fifty characters. i think my score can describe it............................… ExpandVanquish is one of thoose games that gets through on some real fun gameplay but every thing els is pretty much average . the game is just to short . some where around 4-5 hours. the story doesnt do much some thing about russians splintering into a new faction and attacking san francisco with a new wepon from space and the action begins and not much of any story after that. the voice acting is decent and the wepon selection is ok with about 8 differnt guns and 2 types of grenades . where the game shines is in its crazy action with your charicter flying across the floor at what looks like 100 MPH shooting stuff . all in all vanquish has it where it counts its fun . i picked mine up new on sale at Kmart for $27. this game is certainly worth picking up if you can get it for under $30. the short time it takes to beat it keeps it from wanting to pay more then that. otherwise its certainly worth renting.The great forgotten game of 2010, switch the language to Japanese to get rid of the poor voice acting, exercise your trigger finger to avoid frustration then dive into a shooter that is willing to do something a little bit different. I just hope there is a sequel with a multiplayer focus because the way this game was put together and the polish of everything including the visuals is astounding.Seriously, how short can a game be? Its fun in parts, but christ If it wasn\\'t for the large boss health bars the game would be half the length. Rent for a laugh and a few hours of  ADHD enducing action, but dont buy unless you want to feel like a sucker.Excellent gameplay, decent graphics and sound and a weak story. The characters are gross exaggerations of overly simplified western stereotypes which makes everything seem, well, cheesy for lack of a better word. Gameplay is very good which makes the game a lot of fun to play. It\\'s took bad they botched the story,\\'this could have been a 9 plus experience. Oh well, I\\'d give it 8.5/10, no more but have to give 8/10 due to lack of .5 increments.   The game is more 8 than 9.Wow....Ok, I heard this game was short and so I didn\\'t consider it when it first came out...but then I bought it dirt cheap later on after it became a bit stale to the market. There it sat in my hoard of games to get around to eventually....I mean another shooter on the pile to be saved for a rainy day to be played and then quickly sell the sucker for a couple bucks trade in right ? We all know that routine right? Wrong!  Whoa.....did this game ever take me by suprise. Its a keeper and due to its perfect length of 6 or so hours its a game that begs you to take it on again. What you say??? Yep, 6 hrs but those 6 hrs are crack cocaine and adrenaline. The interesting thing about this 6 hours is that you are told at the start of the story the mission time of the story line is 8 hrs so really this adds a real time drama to the game on top of its nature - i guess they expect the game to take most players 8 hrs,and this story tidbit really tricked me to become even more immersed in the story and drama of the games story. Another  fun aspect of this game was you don\\'t just play this game you rack up a score and at the end of the game you have a score just like this was a 6 to 8 hour arcade game but right there in your house. The other thing that peeked my interest in this game was the weapon swaps and depending which you took and which you used you ranked them up so you have a lot of role playing strategy in this shooter. You see you are part of a commando so you choose your role by which weapons you take and how aggresive you go ahead or stay behing you AI allies. If you want to be the sniper who takes out nastys before they arrive you can, you can snipe explosive barrels....or you can go all in with assault rifles and be the frontline hero. There are tons of ways to strategize this game and make each replay different. This is an incredible idea...having just a 6 hour game and to amass as much score as possible. So what in reality is a 6 hour game is more so a 6 hour game that will not bore you to play again, and again and again. I think I will at least try this game 3 or 4 times before it becomes a bit stale and whatever to me. But for now its short and sweet enough to repeat and long enough to savor a story. Its a very reasonable way to minimize player commitment and at the same time provide the same value as a 20 hr plus game without creating a drag on. Definately a game to keep and I don\\'t really do that with shooters, they are so common. Wow again. This was a blast. I highly recommend. So many shooters seem to be linearized tutorials aimed to train you for online action, this one is just a fantastic standalone shooter that you can call your quilty pleasure.The best PlatinumGames project yet. It starts off like a run-of-the-mill space shooter, but then the first boss transforms into a giant mech that fires thousands of missiles at you in one attack, and the game starts to show the Shinji Mikami charm. Combat is fast and intense, and using your suit\\'s booster jets to power slide across battefields never gets dull. The weapons are satisfying for the most part, however others like the LFE gun and Lock-on Laser aren\\'t very useful, and there aren\\'t many weapons in the game altogether so you\\'re likely to stick to the same 3 or 4 weapons for the entire game. The boss battles are a treat, with quick-time events given a wonderful over-the-top execution. There isn\\'t much story and what little characters there are never really get developed. This would be forgiveable if the incredibly fun game play lasted much longer. On the easiest difficulty you\\'ll finish this game within 4-5 hours. While you will very likely want to play through again on a harder difficulty immediately afterwards, it\\'s still disappointing that the campaign is so short, and with no multiplayer and only online leaderboards, there isnt much else to do but to play through on the higher difficulties hunting trophies. Still, while a sadly brief game, Vanquish is one of the most insanely fun games you\\'ll play this year. Even if you don\\'t want to pay full price for it, I highly recommend it when it drops in price, and I\\'m calling it an essential rental. Here\\'s hoping for a bigger, better and funnier sequel.While the game may be over quicker than most like, it takes up slack by revving up the action and crafting an intriguing story that I hope to see continue. The ARS suit brings up fond memories of Casshern and Guyver, and the weapon swapping system is interesting in that the more you pick up the same kind of weapon, the more your suit refines it\\'s model of that weapon, upgrading it\\'s performance.I do not understand people who claim they can play this game on the hardest setting in under four hours. Clearly they haven\\'t tried playing on it. It\\'s mental.In any case, this game is great! It\\'s got excellent graphics, gameplay that doesn\\'t bore even after two playthroughs, lots of references to other games and a killer difficulty (at least on Hard/ God Hard. Damn that ending boss). Though the storyline is pretty mediocre, it doesn\\'t bother too much since you just want to keep playing.The ending scene hints for a sequel? Let\\'s hope.Vanquish is a really good game that suffers from a few problems, the pacing is non-existent, story is corny and predictable, and someother  minor things. But with so many good things, it doesn\\'t matter because no matter how I look at it, Vanquish is a great game with more good than bad.This is a pretty good and interesting action game. The artistic design is kind of nice, graphics are good technically. What is important about this game, what makes it stand out from the rest of the shooters are several mechanics kidn of unique to it, at least in this combination and usage. Three of them are these: (1) Slow-Motion âan extraordinary game, full of frenetic action and speed. JapaneseÂ´s product and the clear signal that they too know how to do shooters up to the top.Shinji Mikami proves to be a genius once more. This is the best 3rd person shooter of all time. It doesn\\'t have a good story and you can finish it in 6 to 8 hours, but the controls are so smooth, the action is simply breathtaking, and it looks very polished. Not worth a full price, but pick this up. This is, or at least should be, the next generation of shooters.Now this is what i call gaming entertainment. It\\'s not a great story i give you that. In fact i din\\'t took the trouble to try to follow it to be honest. But the action, my God, the action. It feels, looks and sounds amazing and every bit it\\'s just exhilarating!!One of the first games I picked up in the bargain bin after I got my PS3.  Absolutely underrated as far as the attention it got when it came out.  It probably made $30.  I don\\'t even know anybody in person that heard of this game. Probably the best 3rd person shooter out there as far as I\\'m concerned, and I\\'m always right about stuff as far as you know.  Fast and furious with a story that won\\'t want to make you go beat a homeless person.  Seriously, though... check it out.  And DON\\'T beat a homeless person.  Not having a home already sucks bad enough.This is a sold shooter! Exactly what I want from this type of game story was perfect length not too long and not too short, with bonus content and online rankings to keep you playing if you loved the combat system. Got it for free with my playstation plus membership very glad I downloaded it! Tight controls, fast paced combat, with what I would call\" Bullet time\" very close to how it worked in Max Payne 3. The only reason its not a 9 is the voice acting scratchy war vet scratchy main character voices seemed to close. The difficulty on normal is great you will most likely die quite a few times.This is definitely a great game for third-person shooter fans. The game is short but there are a good number of challenge missions to keep you occupied. The story is a little predictable but all the flashing lights and gunfire will keep your attention if not make you have a seizure. Great sci-fi action, shooting, game mechanics. Is certainly worth playing and having in your collection. A+!This game literally has one of the most amazing concepts I have seen in a game. The controls are fluid and responsive, the suit looks and is, amazing. The slow-mo moments are perfect and the game deserves to be given more credit where it\\'s due, the game literally does everything right in terms of game-play, in the story however, that\\'s it\\'s weakest point, but the story essentially doesn\\'t matter when the game-play literally drowns it out.Fast-paced third-person action with Sam Gideon. Gameplay is furious and its amazingly fluid even for 2014 standards! the star of the game is Gideon´s suit who gives diferent options when facing the enemy, head on with a dash ? using cover and use your head and tactics ? all there! Story is short ( play on Hard or above!) but you will get so impressed that you wont thinkabout this as a waste of moneytime. Its good on the eyes, insane rythim, fluid and fun, vanquish will make your boredom dissapear!OMG this was awesome! If you have a PS3 this is a must buy! Great visuals, a interesting story, cool enemies and a chain smoking main character in a hyper-awesome combatsuit! Count me in!This game is the meaning of video game. Fast, exciting, responsive, satisfying with bullet time as icing on the cake. The first game I got for my ps3 and still my favourite.Action masterpiece, one of PS3\\'s most fun games.The campaign is short, this is the only reason why I don\\'t give 10.

The story may suck but the combat and camp are too **** perfect to miss out on. I recommend playing this, and it has a remaster.This is the game that convinces me that the platinum games studio is one of the best in recent times. I love the fluidity and style of their games. for me a masterpiece and a game that you must play.\\n\\nSTORY: 8\\nGAMEPLAY: 10\\nMUSIC: 8\\nVISUALS: 10\\n\\nPERSONAL SCORE: 10 ----> A MASTER PIECEA pleasant plot and many interesting mechanics.It was interesting to run and shoot, not like in Call of Duty (there is no linearity and thoughtless shooting range).\\nA Nice Story and A Lot of Interesting Mechanics.IT WAS Intersting to Run and Shoot, Not Like in Call of Duty (There Is No Linearity and Thumbles Shooting Range).A genuinely fun game with a great graphic style & quick run and gun game play. The story is a cliche so don\\'t expect to cry at the end, but for a 5 hour game it\\'s not a boring one.\\n\\nThe main draw is your character has a unique suit that glides across the floor, allowing you to shoot your enemies in slow motion (Platinum games doing what they do best!). With plenty of weapons to play with from a standard machine gun to a saw blade launcher, you will find your favorites and upgrade them to match your play style.\\n\\nMy favorite parts were the boss battles which come around quick and plenty of them. You can still pick this up for cheap on the PS3 or now pick up the 4K edition that is boxed with Bayonetta. Both games are well worth playing, and the better you get at playing, the more of a bad ass you feel.Very good game and a very fast gameplay which I always like in video games! The only thing that I didn\\'t like on this game is that they don\\'t have a wide variety on bosses and you have to fight some bosses 2 or even 3 times in different areas and stages in the game which makes it a little boring but although it\\'s a very good game with very good mechanics and a big amunation. I really recommend this game!Its face paced action is sure a good thing. However, the games to short and besides the turbo function nothing special. Still had fun with it, liked the end fight.A great-looking game with an emphasis on having fun. Vanquish isn\\'t attempting to wow anyone with its plot/narrative, it\\'s all about giving the player some cool toys to play with. Story and dialogue are clichéd and cheesy with hammy voice acting, but I got the impression the game knew that, and didn\\'t care, which as far as action games go is just fine.Vanquish, a game I got mad at countless times... I can\\'t really complain since I got it free through PS+, but I will still review it. I swear they must have picked the worst voice actors in this game other than Elena. But Robert Burns, my God... He sounded horrible, and the main character wasn\\'t bad but not great at all. So basically this games story won\\'t make sense, the story is based in the future with Russia and the US at \"war\" never heard of this concept before! The Russians have taken control of Providence, a space ship that hold American personnel and civilians. The Russians used this beam weapon to destroy San Francisco and have told the US to give up. And the US says no and send troops to destroy Russian robots... That\\'s it. That\\'s extent of the story! If you\\'re a shoot em up kinda gamer you may like this, \\'cause that\\'s all you do in this game. Every mission is go kill robots here, go on an elevator fight more robots, go on a flying \"ship\" if that\\'s what you want to call it and once again kill more robots. There is little variation between robots, there is the big and small robots and some ANNOYING bosses. The bosses are some of the cheapest in a game ever. The learning curve is something that drew me and a lot of other people away from the game, its so steep. The first boss you face is hard, and I did beat him with 5 to 6 deaths, which by the way takes away from your average score. The weapons are also pretty basic, you got the rocket launcher, sniper, machine guns, laser guns, and some special weapons. I hated how the turrets are not infinite or even have that much ammo, they run out of ammo so fast. I think some of the only things I liked about this game was the graphics, the graphics for their time are good. But looking at them now, they\\'re not so good they\\'re decent. Sam\\'s suit, however, is very creative and has a lot of moving parts and the weapons also look good. I also like the games slow-mo mode, and adds depth to the combat system which by the way is pretty cool. Your character is usually just a \"lets go kick some butt\" type of guy, which gets very annoying. Also I don\\'t thing I ever cared about one character in this game, except for Elena. She is about the only character that has some depth and story behind her. Not to forget, the story at the beginning was laughable, WHY? Why even start it like that (no spoilers), no one shows fear at all. San Francisco was just blown sky high and everyone is showing no fear, or even something that grabs your heart and pulls you in. They don\\'t even explain how they took over the ship in space, or why a civilian space craft would be armed with a weapon capable of leveling a city of that magnitude. I am glad I got this game for free and didn\\'t have to pay for it. I would not recommend this game.Vanquish\\'s appeal bases on the traditional aspect of mastering the difficulties of a game.\\nThe game doesn\\'t offer amazing graphics, new gameplay innovations or a lot of variety or content. Hell, even the story is nothing but bland, so are the stereotype characters.\\n\\nBut there is one thing that this game handles exceptionally well: The balance between challenge and frustration. On higher difficulties you really face a challenge and intense combats and that\\'s got to be worth something.Quick reviews to help with your purchase.\\nAn understatement to call this game fun. Fast paced and a breath of fresh air for third person shooters. Lukewarm plot, though used best to help pace the game and certain times excite the player before taking over the controller again. Short at base game, expects player to either play on a harder difficulty, or try one after first play through.Short but hook.Good gameplay, Simplón argument although with its plot turns.Good graphics, the usual ones in Sega, nothing special.Something repetitive in terms of variety of enemies and scenarios.To me, everything about this game is perfect, except for 2 things. No multiplayer and it can be beaten in like 2 days, at max a week.\\n\\nHowever it is a great example of how a fast, arcade style shooter should be like. Even the ending credits were the bomb.*DISCLAIMER: Although this review is being posted on the page for the PlayStation 3 version the game, the version I played was actually on the PlayStation 4, and was part of the “Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle” that recently came out. There’s no individual page for the PS4 version of the game, so this is the closest I can get to that. I don’t think it’ll make a huge difference, but I thought I’d get that out there regardless.*\\nEven though I’ve found myself getting PlatinumGames’ titles a bit more, I didn’t think I’d be giving this game a shot anytime soon. Blame it on the fact that my brother picked up the “Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle” for the PlayStation 4 that I found myself intrigued by it. Not only that, but in doing a lot of research, I found that a lot of people considered this to be an underappreciated gem (like many of PlatinumGames’ games), and a considerably innovative game in the shooter genre. So, given that I heard that it was a pretty short game if you play through it once, I thought it would be worth giving it a try to see if I enjoyed it as much as anyone else. And maybe I’m spoiled by the “Bayonetta” games and “Astral Chain” that I found this one to be not quite as good as PlatinumGames’ best, but even so, I will agree that I mostly enjoyed my time playing through the game.\\nAs many have said, I will give it to PlatinumGames: with “Vanquish,” they’ve created a fun and fast-paced game with this one. From a gameplay perspective, there’s a lot to love about this one: the controls are fluid, the action is compelling, and there are lots of really cool movement mechanics. I do think in that sense, the game does still feel fresh, distinct and different than other third-person shooters. I especially enjoyed the game’s “AR Mode” mechanic, and the ways that it added to your character’s movement and reflexes, and it really added an extra layer to a game that definitely had plenty of those already. On paper, I think the game’s robotic, somewhat futuristic setting is pretty great, the graphics are sharp even today, and aesthetically, this is yet another wonder from PlatinumGames. They have a strong knack for creating very interesting worlds and clever gameplay, and with “Vanquish,” they certainly don’t fall flat in those areas.\\nI will say, though, that in a few areas, they do fall flat: for starters, the story is boring and overly-cliché. I know that PlatinumGames has crafted a lot of titles with over-the-top stories like “Bayonetta” and “The Wonderful 101,” but at least those games didn’t take themselves TOO seriously, and the writing became more charming as a result. Here, the game tries a bit too hard to be serious, and it just misses the mark. Not helping much is that the dialogue is complete CHEESE, and even though some might enjoy the campy nature of the voice acting, I found myself all too frantically trying to find reasons not to skip the cutscenes because they were just not fun to watch. Also, while the gameplay is mostly very strong, I will agree that I found the campaign can be really short, not just in its overall length, but in its mission structure. The game’s five-act structure awkwardly ratios the number of missions in each act, and the length of these missions can feel a bit awkward for me, especially given the way that some of the cutscenes disrupt the gameplay. It often feels like a mission ends, and you find yourself going, “oh…that’s it?” and not feeling as fulfilled as you probably should.\\nOverall, I have to say that “Vanquish,” to me, is far from PlatinumGames’ best game. It doesn’t nearly approach the standard set by the “Bayonetta” games or the company’s most recent title “Astral Chain.” With that said, though, it’s still a rip-roaring fun time while it lasts, and while there are elements that do hold it back for me, I think the gameplay has aged very well, to the point where it still feels like a very distinct game even a decade after its initial release. That alone is what makes it worth playing in my eyes: the fast-paced action and stellar gameplay make up for its short length and narrative shortcomings, and make it a game you should definitely try yourself. Don’t expect it to be the most mind-blowing thing you’ll ever play, but if you’re in the mood for some brainless but exhilarating, good old-fashioned fun, “Vanquish” will certainly satiate your desire.\\nFinal rating: 7 out of 10 “Good”Graphics:  Nice graphics, not the best some low textured environments.  8.\\n\\nSound:  Fast paced themes match the game just fine, the voice acting isn’t the best, and at best its average.  7.5.\\n\\nGameplay:  The game is a fast paced third person shooter with suit abilities that allow you to boost and fly through and shoot enemies.  The game also has a slow-mo mechanic built into it.  The shooting in the game feels kind of arcady but that’s not a bad thing.  The game is littered with enemies which can get very annoying throughout the beginning of the game.  Near the middle to end you get a laser gun which makes the game feel a lot better, although the game litters more enemies and reuses bosses/mini bosses.  The boss before the last boss was a real pain in the ass, because at times even (playing on normal) regular enemies when they are about to die, they end up doing a 1 hit kill, which makes the game more cheap than challenging.  Overall it’s a good game.  8.5.\\n\\nStory:  Confusing story, weird at times, cliff hanger endings, a main protagonist who thinks he’s solid snake.   Average story. 7.5.\\n\\nReplay Value:  The game has 5 acts and on normal I beat it in about 6-8 hours.  There’s no feel to want to play it again on any harder difficulties, once is enough, I would rent or get this game cheap.  I got it free with plus.  7.5.\\n\\nOverall Score: 7.8 out of 10.Some games are get older not so good. What about this game: we have generic TPS with generic level design (ALL levels are made from absolutely same boxes, walls, elevators, etc.), very strange weapon upgrade system (you need to DON\\'T use weapon if you want to upgrade it, wtf?), very dumb story. The game is short, but all this 5 hours is so long because of very boring and repetative situations. Some bosses you need to kill several times. Some enemies can one-shot kill you even on normal difficulty. This game tries to kill you for literally ANYTHING. You need to cover from strong enemies, but game gets you into narrow corridors. Meh. And it have an achievement where you need to walk through the game without dying. Are you f*cking serious? This dumb sh*t not worth it.It was really good to switch off.It goes through briskly like a 12 episode anime.Controls well and is staged bombastically.\\nA very tasty snack for in between.Platinum Games knocks it out of the park with Vanquish. Its frantic gameplay and great level design makes this one of their best games.',\n",
       " 'Every room had its own detail.The music really suited the game, and it was unpredictible, you didnt now what was going to happen next. Its not that easy either, you have to use your brain alot. Its an excellent game to send a shiver up your spine.1996. The year I was born. Also the year the very first Metal Slug was released. Also the year when Capcom finally released a Survival/Horror game. The formula is one of the best ever. Unlike games like Max Payne, which is just shoot, slo-mo, shoot, slo-mo, this game has it\\'s OWN genre. Ok, so Barry and Jill may sound like they\\'re talking to 3-year olds, but you also get to experience realism. Like Jill, she isn\\'t exactly the toughest person in the game, and she proves this at the start by getting Barry to shoot your first zombie. That\\'s another thing in realism, you dont have fifty billion clips, and I\\'m sure zombie dogs do not drop them. You have to search in drawers, and even your teammates. KEYS. They are the annoying thing. You don\\'t have infinite item slots, although I don\\'t think it would be possible to fit a grenade launcher in your pocket... I love the run instead of shoot as well. Killing everything is a waste of time because soon enough, hunters will break loose and take the zombie\\'s positions. Best of all, puzzles! Logical, physicall, and sometimes impossible puzzles! When you get the game guide of GameFAQs you\\'ll say; \\'Oh yeah, why didn\\'t I think of that\". And the sequels too. Resident Evil 3: Nemesis proved even more of a scare with the Nemesis on your tail. Roaring like and idiot. And I like how they introduced actually pushing zombies away, as Capcom seems to put another excellent feature in each game. Fantastic Work, the DS version is great too!Heart-pumping classic, and the start of a huge series & franchise.At the time when this game came about, it was simply a ground-breaking game for survival horror genre. The way it makes you scared, almost 99% of the time is something remarkable. I remember how grateful I was everytime I found an ammo or new weapon, how frustrating it was sometimes to complete puzzles and defeat bosses, how I constantly run away into safe rooms to just relax for a moment, how proud I was after I finnished the game. A game to remember for sure ..This is where resident evil and capcom took off. Re1 was fantastic,by today\\'s standards it would even score 30%Where do we start off with such an amazing series. This is probably the scarier of the Resident Evils for PS, not including PS2. I can\\'t wait until they release the remastered version to play this on PS3.\\n\\nThis game series is highly addictive, but well worth the time invested.And so it begins! Must say Im surprised that 9 kids gave this game negative reviews, but of course, retards have freedom of speech, yeah yeah, I know.One of the best Resident Evil game i had ever played on the playstation one.Great graphic back in 1996 and still one of the best psone video games ever created.Great, definitely worth attention. Revelation in horror games, scary and fun. Full of puzzels and monsters, this game will suck you in for hours. This is what we shall expect with every Resident Evil release.Enjoy the proper birth of Survival Horror Genre with this magnificent  title from Capcom.\\nResident Evil is being considered as a classic from Playstation 1 and marks the beginning of R.E.\\nfranchise that soon will flood the film and gaming industry (with all the positives and negatives of that).\\n\\nPlay as Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield as they wander around spencer\\'s mansion, meeting cruel reality with their comrades.\\nGet in first contact with Franchise\\'s finest Albert Wesker, Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers and of course zombies and BioOrganic Weapons.\\n\\nGreat atmosphere that consists from great light effects and soundtracks (can\\'t stop thinking of GameCube\\'s Remake) with standard cameras and very good character controls.\\nIf you play as Jill things will be much easier with greater weapons and 2 more slots in your inventory.\\nIn the other hand Chris\\'s campaign signifies the true experience of Survival Horror.\\n\\nResident Evil : Remake (imo Best Game of Franchise) which released in 2002, is based in this version.\\n\\nPlay this Game.\\n\\nIt\\'s a must Classic...… ExpandStill got charm, even after resi4.the classic that made your little silent hill possible no remake needed to be made but the one they made was alright i am a real resi fan it was one of the first ps games i ever played mitch is obiosuly somone who doesnt know his roots.This game rules. One of the best games I have ever played.Resident Evil is a masterpice ;) It\\'s scary, hard to beat (the first time :P) and the story is good. It\\'s noting like like resident evil 4 and 5. there it\\'s just about killing zombies. There is no puzzles to solve and you get plenty ammo. But in resident evil 1 you need to think and solve pussles, not kill every zombie, and take time to explore the house. :) I don\\'t say everything is perfect, but the game is very old. so what can you expect? they made a remake of the game to gamecube, but i never traid it. I just hope they start make games like this again.Im a Big fan of the series. This is a classic.A reference on the videogames.The remake may be one of the best games in the series but the original game is still the first survival horror.Graphics are quite old now a days, controls arequite... challenging. Otherwise, this is the game, that started the famous resident evil - series. I can only respect this game for creating something new to survival horror -genre.The game that started them all.\\nAnd what a masterpiece it is!\\nI re-lived the survival horror yesterday, finished the game in 7hrs, which is pretty speedy...\\nAll i wanted was the game i played as a kid, whilst not as nerve chilling now, it still thrills to this very day.\\n\\nFor those disliking the controls, try to get the Director\\'s Cut, a rare version which included RE2 demo on a separate disc, you also benefit from dualshock compatability which never was implemented into the original RE.One word; Classic. The atmosphere. The characters. The puzzles. The Mansion is the birthing place of survival horror. The game has been outdone by the superior Remake, but the original still holds its own with nostalgia and campy voice acting. Entering into the Mansion used to be scary back in the day, but is now charming.This is the game that started it all.  This game truly is one of the best classics in gaming history.  The atmosphere and puzzles are still great and when playing the game you get the sense of nostalgia and it really is just great to relive a classic.  People say the controls suck even when the game was released but i say that the games meant to be like that.  I believe its supposed to be hard to evade the various monsters on the mansion grounds.  The intro and voice acting, even how terrible they might be, will always remain as some of the most memorable things from this game.  No matter what your genre is in gaming, no one can say that this game is not a classic and will be forever.Besides the controls, which I hate immensely I love this game.  The fact that you have very little saving points and ammo makes this survival horror actually scary, because you never know when you will turn a corner and something kills you and you have to start all the way at your last save point.For a series that started off so well it truly saddens me to see how the recent \"RE\" titles seem to have forgotten what this series was (is) about.\\n\\nBeing that \"RE2\" was the first one I played, the PS1 Trilogy is something truly special, birthing \"survival horror\", a huge conspiracy filled character driven story, raw fear for one of horrors most endearing icons and cementing Capcom\\'s status as a real \"for the player\" type company, Resident Evil is a shining example of what rival developers still fail to replicate.\\n\\nSimple story, An elite team from the local town police force goes missing in the mountains, forcing the other team to investigate, upon arrival they are chased by the bizarrely crazed heavily bloodied dogs forcing the surviving members to take shelter in the secluded Spencer Mansion, upon arrival they stumble across the horrifying truths of the previous occupants and you must help Chris/Jill find out what happened to their fellow colleagues in a plot filled with twists, mystery and deception.\\n\\nI mention this because the Introduction video to this game is fantastically cheesy and very self aware, however having it performed by real actors and not rendered in FMV help bring this B-Movie style some extreme level of quote on quote \"realism\" and bonding to the main cast making you want to help them see their way through safely, however you\\'ll be put to the test through a wealth of challenging puzzles whilst having literally less than nothing in terms of items, ammo & health etc.\\n\\nProgressing through the game never stops having you on edge, what shines is how much the actual Mansion itself slowly begins to turn on you, no matter how much you manage to prevail or remove the undead threat, the narrow corridors and later areas constantly challenge and overwhelm to the point where you doubt whether you\\'re going to get Chris/Jill through this and for 1996 these themes were beyond tricky to portray given the industry\\'s lack of horror prior.\\n\\nWhen all is said and done, Resident Evil was a landmark upon arrival, even with the horrendous voice acting and dialogue that has enjoyed many a legacy as an internet phenomenon, to spoil anything would be a disservice and I look forward to playing the equally superb GameCube remake (Review Pending ;-)).\\n\\nFinal Verdict: Where games like \"Silent Hill\" may render you to scared to play it, \"Resident Evil\" throws strategy in the mix to help conquer those fears and ultimately see it through to the end. Solid gaming entertainment.Long long ago, when the Resident Evil series was an adventure/horror series and not an action/shooter series, Capcom actually knew how to make good games. The original Resident Evil is one of them. It\\'s plot is simple, yet intriguing. The game is one of the most atmospheric games of this era and even though it\\'s quite old, you can still tell that it is well designed. The gameplay is excellent as well. Need I say more? This game is a classic.The graphics are awesome 4 ps1 (especially character models), with a PS controller it plays great, though it didnt scare me but not much else comes as close to doing so, Audio: Eerie and epic, EVERYTHING: how do you make an infinity sign on keyboard?My years of nightmares was worth it for this game!\\n\\nYears of nightmares because of this game, I am now 22 and I am perfectly fine *Checks over shoulder for zombie* -There is nothing wrong with me whatsoever! Moving on...\\n\\nThis is one of my all time favourites to play when I was growing up, I have completed this about 3 times? It\\'s a game where you can go back and play it and still (sometimes) get stuck on what you have to do!\\n\\nThe famous iconic moment in this game is when you go throw the dining room to find (possibly Chris\\'s blood) on the floor, then you enter the door in front of you, turn left, then poke your head round the corner and what do you see? A zombie enjoy his MANwich (See what I did there huh?)... He slowly rises his head and turns to you, staring you directly in the eyes as if you\\'re now his dessert!\\n\\nThe camera angles, the cut scenes, the \"omg I think I\\'ve just sh*t myself moments\", totally worth it!\\n\\nA very eerie soundtrack to this game, along with the cut scenes too, it kept the whole \"suspense\" going, it\\'s like you needed a bowl to sit on just in case... Y\\'know?\\n\\nThe dialogue... Well, now that was laughable! Who could ever forget \"You were almost a Jill sandwich\" HA-HA BARRY! That was... That was just dreadful! (Nice try Capcom, nice try).\\n\\nMy only upsets were, controls were very clunky, dialogue was... Garbage!\\n\\nVery good storyline! Shame the acting was terrible though!\\n\\n9/10.Classic horror game, fun to this day.Even with its outdated gameplay it is still worth rejoicing the classic for everything it represents.I do not have to say anything. But i need to write one hundred and fifty characters. i think my score can describe it.................................… ExpandTrue classic. One of the best horror games ever. Deep atmosphere and good gameplay. You move in giant residence filled with traps, secret rooms and zombies. Your task is to find missing team at first, but then you realize that your task is to escape this place alive.Giving birth to the legendary series that is RE, this game set the survival horror formula perfectly well. It\\'s a metroidvania game, where you navigate through the unknow, dangerous mansion unlocking new areas as you find new keys exploring, while making you feel the oppressiveness of the mansion in it\\'s atmosphere and is it\\'s notorious difficulty. This game is a masterpiece, it\\'s atmospheric, it\\'s difficult, it\\'s scary, it\\'s memorable. A better survival horror game than this, only this game\\'s own remake.One of the best games on the first PS, game masterpiece, game legend, which paved the way for the horror industry and not only.I take off my hat before the developers, in those years, there was one of the best on PS1.10/10Its been surpassed by its sequals and other games influenced by it but RE is a real rareity - a game that was not only original but gave us a whole new genre. However, where is the sadly underrated RE3 on Metacritics list of Playstation games?Best game ever in 1996 and still the best RE game.A true innovator and creator of a genre, Resident Evil is the first (and one of the best) \"survival horror\" games. Borrows elements from puzzle and action games with a splash of B-movie horror and acting. The classical and ambient soundtrack really adds to the atmosphere and foreboding of the game, strengthening the feelings of isolation and desperation while locked inside an undead-infested mansion. Combat is the game\\'s weakest point, with aiming being a struggle; however, the game promotes avoiding combat so this isn\\'t a serious issue. Despite some camera and combat issues (which are to be expected considering how new 3D games were at the time of it\\'s launch), Resident Evil is a true masterpiece worth playing still today.It might not be the best in its series, but no one can deny, the first Resident Evil redefined the survival horror genre. Playing it for the first time in years I couldn\\'t help but cringe, its blocky graphics, scary in a bad way voice acting, and sluggish controls make it by todays standards abit dated. Rub at its surface and you\\'ll however inevitably find its diamond core. The eerie music, groan and sounds from the enemies and the horror it invokes still has a class of its own, inspiring real fear and helplessness. The story is good but nothing sensational, but those who enjoyed the game before will be happily nostalgic playing it in this day and age.This is one of the best games in the genre, and of the best games for the PS1 ever. It\\'s slightly more action-oriented than the more scary RE1, but it doesn\\'t make it lesser of a game. The action-horror atmosphere actually fits very well, but maybe it could have been slightly better if it was a teeny tiny bit more scary. Who knows. The music and the sound effects are excellent and gives the game an eerie atmosphere. The dialogue is kinda cheesy, but that\\'s the way I like it. It has a lot of puzzle-solving which is a good thing, and it has interesting environments and characters. 2 separate characters with 2 separate scenarios each (granted the scenarios aren\\'t very different from one another), and an extra mini-game with Hunk and Tofu gives this game a great replay-value. Plenty of interesting bosses including: alligator, Mr X., different mutations of William Birkin, G-Virus\\' \"Offspring\", the Moth (although not really a boss). 1-2 more boss-fights had been perfect though. I think Chief Irons had made a good boss, imagine a boss-fight with a human who isn\\'t infected by some kind of virus, blasting away with a hunting rifle, and setting off traps (he enjoyed hunting) during the fight. A boss-fight against one of Hunk\\'s team members would have been nice too. A G-virus mutated mercenary with a machine gun. Plenty of different monsters such as: a few different kind of zombies (but where are all the children zombies?), 2 kind of lickers, 2 kind of walking plants, spiders, dogs (where are all the cats though?), crows. Cats and snakes (there are only sissy snakes, and few of them) would have been cool. Some kind of different bird would have been nice, since there are only crows/ravens/whatever. Summary: A solid 10, it is everything that a Resident Evil should be, and I will NEVER get tired of this game. I still remember the first time I saw this game, it was when I watched my friend play the RE2 demo, which his older brother had got from his copy of RE 1 Dir. Cut. I was awe-struck and deeply fascinated when i watched my friend play it. It\\'s more than 10 years later now, and the fascination of this game hasn\\'t decreased,Resident Evil’s clunky controls are less forgivable nowadays and the graphics simply look horrible but at the time this was quite rightly considered a classic. One of very few games to be genuinely scary it was like nothing else available and demonstrated just what the Playstation was capable of. Anyone wanting to experience the birth of one of gaming’s most well known series should really check out the superb GameCube remake.For when it came out it was a great game and truly set the genre for decades to come. Graphics were good and very detailed and looked really nice on the PS1. Sound, music and lighting set the atmosphere perfectly. This is the root of survival horror and it shows (the good and the bad.) While it has since become a bit iconic  the voice acting is just terrible, even then. I\\'ve heard fan made re-recordings that were better and more professionally done.  But voice acting aside the gameplay is just first rate. Overall: Truly a classic, in the B-horror movie kind of way. It hasn\\'t aged well and would rather defer to the Gamecube remake if you want to experience the game.Graphics were sucky, but I understand that this is an old game so I learned to look past that and try and cherish what people enjoy out of this game. However, the character voices were so gay, they should have just used subtitles. Also, the difficulty was too extreme. I played the director\\'s cut (which allowed me to receive double the amount of whatever items i picked up such as ammo, ink ribbons, etc.) and I still had trouble. I like to play video games to relax and have fun, not bite my teeth and chuck my controller.Horrible graphics, controls and worst of all gameplay. If you are looking for a classic horror title get Silent Hill.The game has it\\'s scares, but people, take off your nostalgia glasses and look at it. It pretty fun and entertaining and all, but these controls are some of the worst, EVER. Don\\'t even bother with the analog, because you will be frustrated to breaking your controller with your bare hands, the digital mode (the arrow keys to the left of the controller) may be better, but that isn\\'t saying much, not at all.\\n\\nSo be warned, if you can get used to the controls, it is a pretty decent game, just not a classic.A classic of Survivor Horror games! Epic, great characters mas enemies, Capcom have tô learned with the past.The game is not even scary, and it should not belong in the survival horror genre. I dont know why most ppl are praising Mikami, he is not even an good at making survival horror games. Plus the game thats very bad graphic, poor voice acting, poor dialogue, if yur looking for a better survival horror, play silent hill, fatal frame, or dead space.And the fixed controls and camera are unjustable, at least the music and decent are horrible.This is definately one of the best games EVER 4 game consoles in general, game plays excellent, puts a different angle on games. can\\'t say much 4 the graphics compared 2 RE4, but wot can u expect from a game made in 1996. thoughly enjoyed the game.Resident evil 1996 is the best game ever! best graphics and creepy zombies. better than 2, 3 and code veronicaThe scariest game I ever played. The original (and remake on Game Cube) are still the best IMO. Resident Evil set the standard for this genre. The zombies, music, scenery and 3rd person perspective all tied together to make a truely wonderful (and scary) experience!Still one of the best games ever made.........the remake is the sh.t.Resident Evil 1 earned a place in gaming history as it is considered by many as the first true survival horror game and with that it created the genre. It was a remarkable B-movie inspired game that spawned a strong franchise including movies. The story focus on an elite police squad named S.T.A.R.S. who went out on a mission to investigate a series of mysterious deaths in Raccoon Forest. After the stylish and cheesy B-movie intro you and your team are stranded in the Spencer mansion near Raccon Forest. Already the team is trapped into what seems a nightmare. It is solid B-movie entertainment and I considered it fitting for the game. This is about entertainment and not Game of Thrones politics or Shakespearean plays ;-). You can chose between two playable characters. Jill Valentine who can pick locks, has an inventory space for 8 items and can play piano (Last one is not useless information) or Chris Redfield who has only an inventory for 6 items. The story differs a bit for both characters and there are also some minor branches including different endings. The atmosphere of the game is great and scary. You are quite limited and must make hard decisions as inventory space is limited (This includes weapons and ammunition too!) and you cant save at any time because you must use a typewriter in save rooms with a limited number of ink ribbons (I know this is blasphemy today but here it made the experience intenser). You can store the other items in a box in save rooms. Part of the game is survival as you face a lot of enemies and the ammunition is limited (You can use a knife instead but this is a bit tricky to master). The enemy variety is good and the bosses are impressive. Another part are the riddles. You have to solve a few puzzles and use the correct items at the right places. It was these combination of a B-movie story, intense ammunition management, survival and puzzles that made the game so good back then. This is a fitting direction to my complains. The game does not hold up today and without nostalgia googles I would rate it today far lower. However there are a view strong remakes. Back then my complains would be that the intro is not in color and the controls as you can move only forward and backward as left and right change only your direction. This created the term “Tank like controls” in gaming. Other aspect like limited inventory are O.K for me but I can see that others are annoyed. Overall this was a classic and I have fond memories even if it did not reach a 10/10 for me. I would advise that you play a remake instead like the excellent HD remaster.Resident Evil series is a top of the top games! I\\'m a fan of resident evil games. And this part was a first part of this best horror games.A classic in the survival horror department. The game that launched the series was a must play when it released in 1996 and is still a must play today with the HD Remaster version out on modern consoles.positive points:\\n-The designs of the enemies are of a putísima mother\\n-The exploration is great\\n-Barry is the fucking master\\n-Wesker even more\\n-Their addictive to but not be able to\\nBad points:\\n-You have very powerful weapons very early (such as the shotgun or the spleen)\\n-Asholes are almost impossible to know without guide\\n-The dubbing is shabby (very shabby)\\n-The performances in the Live Action scanas are sorryPerfect game.When he was playing, he was 20 years old and 20 years ago.\\nThe sense of oppression, escape, especially when using Chris ammunition is not enough to clear all the time.Compared to the 2nd generation, it is a bit like a shooting game.\\nI used to have a dream, and I had the money to make an exactly the same foreign museum ~Resident evil brought us the true game of terror and survival. Despite the Alone in the dark be the father of survival horror, but I\\'m sorry the fact of terror began with resident evil, it contains much horror unlike Alone in the dark where his main focus and puzzles!\\nThe game takes you there is an incredible level of immersion, you really feel threatened with a simple zombie. The puzzles are great and in the right dosage!\\nGraphic arts good for that time. Plot great, but horrible dubbing, but we highlight and game of 1996. The more elaborate voiceovers were beginning.\\n\\nFinally, Resident Evil and a work of art and that in my opinion and father of survival horror !This is what started it all, from the cheesy yet wonderfully hilarious opening cinematic to the one of the six equally hilarious yet satisfying endings, this game keeps you on the edge of your seat. The scene where you meet the first zombie, though censored in America and Europe, people knew that they were about to enter a world of hell. Even the terrible voice acting has a unique charm to it, though it is still bad. Without this game, we wouldn\\'t have the franchise we have today.The game that changed the concepts of games in your time.One of the most striking games of the fifth generation of consolesI would like to start by saying that survival horror is not my genre of choice. With that being said I completely agree that this is a good game. After never playing a survival horror game I figured I would give the granddad of the genre a try and it did not disappoint. My first observation was the apparent lack of hand holding that you get from many games these days. I was six when this game was originally released so maybe that was just the way games were made in the early PS days but either way it brought about a very different experience from what I was expecting. This game made it frustratingly obvious at times that this was no combat game and I had to use my brain to figure out how to advance (I may have also asked a few of my friends who played this back in the day but I refused to use the internet lol). Once I understood that everything is a puzzle things went a lot smother and quicker. The puzzles could be frustrating at times but once I figured them out I found myself saying \"well duh\". Combat is fairly primitive. Shooting is as simple as aiming in the enemies general direction and firing till they fall. I found that often times is was best to run away or run around certain enemies to conserve ammo as it can often be scarce and needed for later enemies. My biggest frustration was with the camera system. I thought it looked great from a cinematic perspective but as far as combat goes it was really annoying at times. I would often run right into enemies that were standing right in front of me because the camera angle in the section I came from was facing my front. Decent variety of weapons even though the suffer from some balancing issues. The music is creepy and fits the atmosphere fairly well. The AI reacts as they should and do as you would expect. The games real strengths in my opinion is the story and the atmosphere. The developers did a great job of creating a genuinely creepy and scary atmosphere that made a very non skittish late 20 year old man jump on several occasions with some unexpected enemy attacks and a good balance of slow moving and quick attacking enemies. I am not sure if it was the intention of the writers to create a story that was filled with lovingly terrible voice acting and awkward character interactions but they did..... and it works. By today\\'s standards the story would be considered bad but for some reason it just fits within the narrative of the game and gives the game a certain charm. The game also offers multiple endings I came to find out later (apparently I got the good one with my first run through with Jill). The biggest criticism of the game is that I did not feel that my next play through with Chris was nearly as enjoyable. There wasn\\'t that much of a difference other than a few less inventory slots and few different weapons. I got through the Chris story much faster.\\n\\nAll in all this was a good game given that this genre is not my cup of tea but was successful in making me want to try more Resident Evil titles in the future. It scared the crap out of me at times and made me think a lot. 7/10 GoodThe original Resident Evil for the PS1 is a true classic. Capcom\\'s innovative zombie game is a cheesy, but intense ride from beginning to end. It inspired countless of other similar horror games. While it\\'s very much a creation of the late 90\\'s, the game still holds up well.  I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.This game kickstarted the survival horror genre of games and it was a great thing. The monsters we cool and the characters are now iconic and even some phrases from the game are now always quoted.Alone in the Dark has invented the survival horror genre, but it was Resident Evil that popularized it. As a fan of Resident Evil 4, I was curious about the first game which paved the way for one of the most successful video game series today. I played the original PlayStation version, mind you, not the remake.\\n\\nResident Evil starts strong: A phenomenal, super cheesy 80s B-horror movie cinematic. You are in a mansion and the game is creepy from the get go. I consider myself an experienced gamer and usually play in harder difficulties, but I have struggled too much early on in Resident Evil. I had to rely on knife to preserve ammo (which I have found too difficult) or I had to run away from zombies rather than killing them (which I have found too boring). I then switched to “training” difficulty, which translates to “easy’.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere, loved the music. My gripe was the generally boring puzzles and the backtracking.\\n\\nOverall, I don’t regret playing through Resident Evil. But this is not a case of the original entry being the absolute best of a video game series. Resident Evil started it and some of the later games made it absolutely better.Even though this game is outdated and have tank controls, this game show what survival-horror in video games looks like. The music and the funny voice acting (including Barry who is my favorite in this game) fits the atmosphere in this game. The things they do in this game is creepy but also corny just like The Evil Dead movies. When you feel frightening, the iconic dialogues from this game can make you get a laugh from horror to comedy of a sort. This is how you start off a great series.Duration: 6 hours\\n\\nOne of the best Survival Horros who to play in my PS1 Species of rage, here we can choose between two key characters Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield both experts in combat and different skills when the game begins we must advance through different parts of the mension solving varied puzzles and eliminating enemies and of course manage to find out what It happens on the site, we will run into very difficult bosses (but if you play it for the first time) so we must use the inventory well and avoid spending more ammunition than necessary, an epic story and a very good ending with a final boss quite amazing and still the drop to culminate the glass we discover a traitor who takes us to that site, there are two scenar As I said before (Jill and Chris) Jill\\'s is the simplest since we have a lot Sites (a mansion, a hotel, an underground and a laboratory) all full of very interesting creatures and puzzles making a jewel of the Survival Horrs and more with their very modern graphics for its era.\\n\\nI recommend it? Of course, if you are going to love and more the version of PlayStation 1 since the PC is quite bad.Resident Evil 1 is a game I have a lot of respect for what it did for survival horror and for starting one of my favorite game series. With that being said I do think that this game has aged pretty poorly and I am of the opinion that the remake pretty much improved and perfected everything this game was going for.  That\\'s not to say that this game doesn\\'t have value, merit or isn\\'t worth playing today cause I do think it does. It\\'s just a lot harder I feel to recommend the original over the remake or at least the directors cut of the game. Because when I say the original I do mean I played the original version of the game which when you really boil it down means that there\\'s few unlockable and the music is better. In fact the music is really good on the original release the basement music being my favorite piece for how it heightened the tension I felt while going through. The basement music is my favorite song in the directors cut as well just for entirely different reasons. In addition the original release only has alternative costumes for each character you can unlock which kind of sucks. And there\\'s no auto aim which with the camera angels can make it really difficult to hit enemies some times. But the core gameplay of preserving ammo and healing items and solving puzzles is still really fun and even scary at times. Despite the games very dated visuals it does still mange to bring tension and dread in it\\'s encounters through out the game. Another dated aspect is the story and voice acting which has critical levels of campiness. I think every one already knows this but the voice performance is on another level of how bad and unintentionally funny it is and I do love it. Some cutscenes have what I can call some of the worst 3d models I\\'ve seen in a game and I just love how bad they look. I think the game has a difficulty problem in that Jill\\'s campaign feels kinda easy while Chris\\'s campaign feels a lot harder and far more tedious due to his smaller inventory space. Leading me and seemingly most people to not what to play Chris more then once. The combat in the game is very slow due to in part the fixed camera angels and tank controls. Both of which I don\\'t mind and I think really plays a part in the charm of the game and they work to heighten tension and make encounters all the more threatening. But I don\\'t think it works with some of the enemies such as the hunters. Who can move very fast and sometimes will decapitate you killing you instantly which can be really annoying. I think this same issue is present for most of the boss fights due to their speed they can get a lot of hits in before your able to turn around and properly aim at them which again is very annoying.  With all that being said I do think the game is a very charming experience and is still a good game at it\\'s core just a terribly dated one.A game that has transcended through time. The beginning of a great saga; horror on every corner, an interesting story and good challenge. Their failures, a little intuitive control, and bad performances (it is understood by the time)He did not age very well.While the setting, the tension caused by it and music is appreciated, gameplay and saving system are terrible.Partly ruin a game that could have been one of my PS1 favoritesGreat start to the series. I loved the horror aspect mixed with action.\\nThe storyline was solid. So good that, look, it broke off into a never ending series! The whole build up of the zombies, the danger and the threat, the bad guy, and good guys. Everything was built up perfectly. Setting it up nicely, for the destruction that awaited.\\nThe gameplay was a little clunky (in the original ps1 version. It is much better in the remastered.) But it was still a lot of fun, and manageable. The puzzles were good, and not too hard. But it was mostly the story and anticipation on what will come out at you next that kept you going.Summary: Raccoon City has been completely overrun by mutant beasts and bloodthirsty zombies. You are a member of S.T.A.R.S.--a rescue squad sent into the community to investigate the ominous mansion at the core of the disaster.

The clunky slow controls and awkward camera angles added to that.This game was one of the first genuine horror games that scared me as a child.Revolution at the time, nothing seen previously resembled this.At his time all the kids talked about it.Good sounds and good graphics that at the time seemed super realistic on a CRT television.The control added that sensation of claustrophobia and impotence to the horror salad that the game gladly provided.I think that by eliminating tank -type control and fixed cameras in subsequent deliveries, part of that feeling was lost that was only preserved to Resident Evil 3.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best game for ME 100% !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Where it all began. Zombies, Mansion, Redfield, Valentine, Wesker, S.T.A.R.S.... need I really say anymore?I\\'ll be synthetic. The game is filled to the brim with entirely gratuitous scripted actions. I hate those. Many scenarios are likewise gratuitously slow. I hate that. Zombies\\' reactions to attacks reek of brawler games. Tekken wasn\\'t as clumsy though.This is real survivor horror this is real resident evil anything horror Puzzles Management of resources is very few, places and monsters are difficult to withstand, difficult to escape from themOne of my favorite games, without a doubt, so why does it not have a perfect qualification? It has some errors that simply cannot be omitted and of which I will mention later. Before, a little history. Resident Evil is a Genus Survival Horror video game originally published in 1996 for the first Sony console, the Play Station. In this install Special Forces S.T.A.R.S. And that, in search of the members of the Bravo team, they are forced to take refuge in a gloomy mansion full of biological threats, trying to discover what is the origin of these creatures. In the graphic section I can continue to defend this game despite locating almost 26 years of its publication, the pre -registered scenarios were the avant -garde in its time and allowed to show a great level of detail that continues to be seen quite well today. More praise for this game in the sound, since it achieves with a remarkable success when reaching terror with dark melodies that keep the player in tension and are used at a suitable moments, as well as the use of silence, present in lonely scenarios and that work very well with the genre of this video game, which, without a doubt, despite their age continues to substitute the player. Which speaks of the value of this work even almost 3 decades of the date on which it was released. The gameplay is undoubtedly the section that brings together today, since it does not resemble the most recent deliveries of video games, however I think it works correctly with the design of scenarios that is full of narrow halls, The “tank” style control is made for this style of play, so although at first it costs some work to adapt, once it is dominated it is quite comfortable despite the obvious limitations of mobility or exhaust to the monsters, Since the main character feels quite heavy, forcing to fight with the monsters in most of the time, and to have a certain sense of helplessness, since the camera is fixed and only varies when you leave it, not knowing what it is That there will be when changing angle, although this does not give a complete sensation of terror, it does make the player quite nervous, especially taking into account the management of resources. Resource management, Survival Horror\\'s badge, the arsenal of your character varies depending on who chooses, Jill has a gun, a shotgun, a grenade launcher and a magnum. As for Chris, the variety is the same omitting to the launcher, increasing the difficulty, since, in the same way he can only load with 6 objects while Jill brings 8, however, Chris has greater resistance to damage. Ammunition and health do not vary, forcing the player to choose which enemies to kill and which best hear. Speaking of health, we have items that range from a first aid spray that regenerates a lifetime, to herbs, green, which increases a portion of health, blue, which neutralizes poisonous and red substances, which triples the function of the green. We pass with the argument, which seems quite interesting and entertaining, sometimes you can feel too cliché emulating iconic tapes of class B cinema, but without a doubt, although it has a premise that shines for its simplicity, you can keep the player in tension and expectation until it leads to the outcome of the story. Resident Evil is a great video game with errors, in both campaigns there will be script holes, confusion between what happened to this character or the one who simply disappeared or lost relevance in a plot that does not strive too much to answer each of the questions that does. Despite its deficiencies, this video game continues to assume solid bases in a genre that requires a lot of efficacy to achieve its mission, maintain a terrifying and fun experience, and what Resident Evil achieves this task.This game is incredible. Tension, horror and locations are all distinct and excellent. The cutscenes however are noticeably cheesy which ruins a lot of the tone. Some outdated design choices.It is good even though Chris\\'s campaign has less space in inventory which is a bitching.10/10 Simulator Lutino Babkino Letter in: Add categories to the game of the day in the game',\n",
       " 'This game is the best game of the ps2 consol. I was so addicted to it. The graphics are wonderful and brilliant. This is my all time favorite game. If you dont have it get it. Trust me it is worth it.-I\\'m on the side of those who think this game is near-perfect. And I have no personal bias in favor of the Resident Evil series, because before I played this game it\\'d been several months since I had last touched my PS2. But I remembered seeing the Gamecube commercials for this game and thought it looked really good. So I tried it out an LOVED IT. -The graphics still amaze me, and I think it has some of the best character models and backgrounds on the PS2. The atmosphere is really well-realized: dark, creepy, and best of all, grimy. -The sound was memorable in that subtle sort of way: it\\'s scary when it needs to be, but for the most part the game is silent and uses sound effects to get the mood set. -The characters are hollow but fun to watch on screen. The story is standard Resident Evil nonsense: anyone who plays the series for the story has probably had their brain eaten by zombies. -But the gameplay is what it\\'s all about. The game is fun from beginning to end. The weapons are all great; there\\'s not an over-abundance of ammo lying around so it\\'s challenging. The mutated townsfolk are a nice divergence from the previous zombies, and they\\'re crazy when they run at you. The AI is quite intelligent and challenging. And for those who said there wasn\\'t a single scary moment in the game, well that\\'s cuz this isn\\'t like the old Resident Evil\\'s where things jump out at you. It\\'s a lot harder to do that in true 3-D than pre-rendered games. There\\'s tons of replay value with the different costumes and side-missions. -Yep, definitely one of the best games for the PS2, and one of my all-time favorites.I\\'ve played and past this game 20 times and still it\\'s not starting to get boring I used to play it every Saturday and Sunday from 5:00am to 11:00pmBest horror game! Best thriller game! Best ps2 game!! So great and awesome if you call yourself a gamer then you should definitely give this Masterpiece a shot!!!i swear to god. this game looks like a xbox 360 game or ps3 game. and it was released for the ps2. this game changed resident evil. for the first time this has changed in a good way. but re5 and 6 were bad. i mean 5 was fine but 6 was awful.\\n\\nre4 was my favorite ps2 game of all time. it didn\\'t looked like a ps2 game. it looked like a xbox 360 game. awesome enemies like the chainsaw and the generators which were scary as **** sometimes hilarious jumpscares from snakes. great story and voice acting. amazing weapons and Quick Time events.Fun, exciting and easy to play. Best of the series!Best survivor horror game ever!!Simply Put- Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games ever made. This is a masterpiece. The tempo, the combat, the scares, the gameplay, hell even the story is cheezly good. This game is how action horror games should be made.  The level of impact this game has had on the game industry- Gears of War, L4D, and every other over the should 3rd person shooter this gen. And the boss fights.... OMG. These fights are so amazing- Del Lago, El Gigante, Bella Sisters, Straddler, Verdugo and of course the greatest boss fight in the history of the series. The one. The only. Krauser. These moments are amazingly awesome. This game is amazingly awesome. Play it.This game was my favorite with a good plot and history, drama and action, great graphics, a very good deeper game of a 10 and 100 for critics, I recommend it.One of the best PS2\\'s era game ever. Wonderful game, spectacular visuals, amazing characters, great weapons and enemies, the scenarios are dark and gritty, something expected from a RE game.Simply put, One of the best games EVER made. If u cant enjoy this, u seriously need help. To this date i enjoy the game EVERY **** time i play it    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This installment of Resident Evil changed a bit, and introduced more modern characters that move a lot faster, and it was a great update to a series that has been fantastic since Sega Genesis. This game does not disappoint and like all of the main Resident Evil\\'s(Survivor not included) dominate the ratings. You\\'ll enjoy this game until the very end. Also like all Resident Evil games, expect to be spooked at some point or another, even myself which I rarely ever get spooked.Best RE game of all time in my opinion (just few step ahead from RE2). You must play this game.\\nSurvival horror evolved thanks to this game, the third person shooting system just just awesome.\\nIt brought a new experience to the survival horror games.\\nThe story is pretty interesting, the characters are wonderful developed, everyone is interesting and has an important role in the game. The atmosphere and the enemies design are top notched for the PS2 console. It\\'s  a classic which will live through the time. Few of the games I will score as 10.Resident Evil 4 is a total masterpiece of the action-horror games genre.My favourite console game ever!Amazing graphics,awesome atmosphere,perfect story,nice gameplay.This game is addictive.It\\'s worth every penny.For all intents and purposes, Resident Evil 4 is the magnum opus of the Resident Evil series. The way its atmosphere was dark, sinister and full of fear was a testament to its time and it reworked its gameplay from previous titles to perform groundbreaking genre defining reactions is superb. The weak aspect (the story and its dialogue) fall under this \"so bad that its good\" style that is able to transmute well with the tension and horror that made the weakness almost unnoticeable for me to care. The combat and tension was master crafted and made survival horror a gold standard alongside Silent Hill 2 during the early 2000s. The enemies and bosses, the death scenes, the atmosphere, the music and so much more made RE4 one of the best games of all time for me and that will never change.10/10 = Masterpiece = Innovative and the best survival horror game of all-time. IT\"S ACTUALLY SCARY They should write that on the cover. Pure GeniusThis game was ok. What i don\\'t understand is this isn\\'t a survival horror game, resident was always about zombies, surviving on minimal ammo.Absolutely brilliant, the graphics are a work of art, and the gameplay is awesome.This is the greatest game I\\'ve ever played in my entire life. Everything about this game was spectacular from its graphics, to its gameplay, and even the puzzles. Not to mention this version comes with exclusive missions and weapons that were not in the Gamecube edition. This is easily one of the greatest games ever made and if you hate it, you\\'re an idiot. If you own a PS2, you must own this game. Own one of the greatest games ever made!This game is bloody excellent! The combat, voice acting, graphics, story and characters are all up and above average. It is one of the most atmospheric and suspenseful experiences in gaming, and will stand out as a classic for years to come. Excellent, but is difficult to find in stores and on the internet.A great game with some of the best tension in a game, i played this game so many times.Along with Silent Hill 2, this is THE Survival Horror game. It\\'s amazing, innovative, scary. Controls are amazing, graphics are good. The only downside is probably \"LEON! LEON!\". But that is nothing compared to the rest of the game.This was a great game, plain and simple.  To address those who dislike the shooting system used by RE4, they just did not give enough time to get used to it. When I first bought it and sat down, i was a bit worried about how easy it would be to play.  Not a problem after some getting used to, trust me.   The graphics are awesome, the cinematics are on target, and overall gameplay is all you could ask for and definitely the best RE in the series.  Do not be scared away by these reviewers who complain about the drap scheme or the clunky gameplay... its meant to be a horror 3rd person action game and that\\'s exactly what it is.RE 4 was well designed from the graphics to the revamped control system. With the loss of the fixed camera angles and the addition of the free-aim firing controls, RE 4 has ceased to be simply an amazing game, but a true inovator in survival horror. The story was well written and the game play never became stale. It was scary, exciting and a lot of fun. I would recommened this to long time RE fans and newcomers alike!Resi-evil HAS to be the best game of the year,along with Snake eater. Hooray to Resi4!After the intro scene and after shooting a couple of locals I was thinking that the game would ease me in gently before the real madness starts. So the first village section I came across left me a bit shocked, with wave after wave of crazy demonic sounding villagers coming at you, leaving you firing wildly at a group before fleeing to one of the many houses, because you\\'ll be safe in there wont you? Not a chance, these deranged psychos will smash windows, open doors, even raise ladders so they can get at you on the upper floors. Zombies these guys aint. They run, oh yes, they run at you waving pitchforks/flaming torches/axes (some of them actually fling axes at you from distance), the new brand of enemy on offer here is quite overwhelming and really do give you a feeling of panic as they come at you, the sack-faced fellas with the chainsaws in particular. Killing them however, is extremely satisfying. Shoot that guy with the axes\\' hand and he\\'ll drop it, getting pretty pissed off in the process he runs at you, by pressing x Leon leaps up and kicks him in his crusty face, sending him hurtling back into a group of his pals. The combat is thick and fast, making this more of an action horror game. Resi 4\\'s main strong point has to be the atmosphere, it really is gripping and is created by the amazing graphics, attention to detail, sound effects and music. This game grabs you by the balls and dosn\\'t let you go until you\\'ve completed it. Get it, right now. Go on.Atmospheric brilliance.i know what your all thinking another resident evil game with the clunky controls but this one does not have it which makes the game easier and if you dont have the game you must be living under a rock.i dont know how to describe it. FREAKIN AWSOME.......................... Sorry i\\'m too emotional with joy to describe this game. All i can say is i\\'ll never part with game hopefully as its gaming history in a shiny box! EXCELLENT! Well done the lads at capcom for rejigging the series. Oh where\\'s that tissue .........................This is THE best action/horror game I have ever played and one of my all time favorites.\\nThe feature that makes it so special and unique is it\\'s brilliant and memorable atmosphere which makes you really identify with the main character. The switch between action/horror/relief/tension building is perfectly done and leaves you in awe. I still play and enjoy this game today, when the nostalgia feeling hits me.Well, this game was resounding, whether changing the Resident Evil franchise completely or becoming a revolution for the games of the time.The fact is that Re4 was a bigger bos and best games ever made.What about enemies, bosses, ambiance, impeccable soundtrack?!I will never forget what I went to play this Mikami cousin.Your Raplay factor is too much.Passing the time, hunting treasures, using the weapons with Merchant is fantastic.The gameplay is perfect and gives a wide freedom to the player.The puzzles are present and are very well done.Even with a relatively weak plot, you can\\'t decrease the merits of the game.Its quality is indisputable!If you haven\\'t played yet, look for Re4 as soon as possible, versions abound for that.Two words are going to explain this game:Intense and Amazing !!! Easily the best game of the franchise and my best game of 2005 with Gta:San Andreas for the PC.i dont really think that 5000 letters are enough to describe how perfect this game is !! if you have the chance to get it, JUST DO IT !!!! best game ever 1000000000000000000000/10What can I say? Masterpiece. First game that I literally conquered! If I was counting how many times I played this game, it would reach 100, no doubts! Just amazing! Can\\'t even describe it. Amazing!RE4 is and will always be a shining example of everything that is good about video games. Don\\'t you dare say \"well it\\'s not great cause it isn\\'t a pure survival-horror game\" because RE4 doesn\\'t need a genre and it doesn\\'t need to be grouped with other games just to give it a label. RE4 is in the genre of \"kick-ass awesome game\" and no matter what types of games you like, that should play no role in your enjoyment of this masterpiece.\\ufeffGameplay..............Great\\nGraphics................Great\\nStory.......................BrilliantResident Evil 4 is a classic game for the PS2, offering great soundtrack that fits perfectly in the games tone and gameplay, also having a great character design that for time was beautiful. I also have to mention that, the game fulfills its proposal to be an action game, but still maintaining  the survival horror.… ExpandI\\'m not a big fan of resident but this one I played a lot on the neighbor\\'s PS2A mystical, terrible, long, long and amazing game, starting to play you, it may not imprint you, but then ... You will be surprised as events develop. Interesting opponents, terrible mutations of Igaimpey that will not let you go, playing my memory forever.There are games with a more outstanding plot, as well as a serious drawback in the game is the absence of a quick change in weapons as in RE5 (you have to climb into the inventory every time that reduces the effect of the fight against the zombie), my assessment of the game 97/100 ... Absolute masterpiece ...Completely amazing! A perfect action, horror and survival game, the story is amazing, graphics are really awesome and the gameplay is really funny and interactive.Resident Evil 4 is without a doubt the best game in the series!! The mix between Horror and Action is spot on in this game.. The story is AMAZING! the gameplay mechanics are really good for a PS2 game, and the replay value is really HIGH! especially the HD version which has all the extras from past versions. All in all Resident Evil 4 is an AMAZING! game.. You MUST own it if you like action/Horror gamesMost of the ratings are definetly overrated. There are things which kill the fun in this game. One word: Ashley. She was so freakin annoying, I thought about quitting the game. The boss battles though are as good as always and the shoot mechanics smooth. Stable frames, good graphics for it´s time. Well, you think: Why a 8? Why not a 9? Because Ashley is SO DAMN ANNOYING SHE KILLS THE FUN FOR THE REST OF THE GAME! The Game Designers shot themselves with the shotgun in the knee. Also it´s not real Horror. The Survival Horror left Resident Evil with this game. So it´s one of the better Resi´s but it´s not quite that good. NEVER A 96! 85 is acceptable.Definitely the best RE game to exist! It\\'s exciting, suspenseful, and scary as h**l! Just wish all the newer RE games wouldv\\'e followed the same formula this one had.This Kent C. dude is so wrong about everything! This game IS way too easy. It\\'s just fucking tube where you shoot everything you see. And either this Kent C. misses 90% of the bullets, doesn\\'t pick them up from the ground, because there is way too much bullets in the game. The Ganados (that\\'s the enemies, they are not zombies, get your facts right) drop bullets, there is bullets in barrels, and like that isn\\'t enough, there is some mysterious dude selling weapons to you behind every corner. And those parasites pop out from their heads, even without shooting to the head. Another fact you\\'ve got wrong. And with the controls, it\\'s (supposed to be) a fucking horror game, what did you expect? That your character is John fucking Rambo running up trees and blasting around with M60? Well, okay, he is. And that sucks, because the series is not about this... It used to be an survival horros game, but this new direction it has taken, it is trying to be a action game and a survival horror game... But it fails at both.The plot starts promisingly and the game looks and sounds good but the control system is so painful that I very rapidly lost interest in the title. Almost as infuriating and tiresome as the frankly awful \"The Getaway\", with the same apparent underlying cause - the developer\\'s cinematic pretensions create camera angles that will constantly have you craning your neck and gameplay that appears to have been designed for watching rather than for easy control of your avatar. Avoid.Great game!!!! The reveiws are so dead on. This game brought life back into a genre that was stagnant. The only thing I thought it was missing was a more stealth approach to attacking the enemies. i.e.- A metal gear solid approach.The PS2 version has more extras than its GCN predecessor, but the graphics are slightly but noticeably inferior. Having said that, this game is certainly the best RE ever and one of the best games on either system. The story is admittedly cliche (kidnapping the President\\'s daughter? Come on), and the dialogue is as bad as usual for RE, but none of that matters. This game puts \"Action/Shooter\" and \"Survival Horror\" in a blender to make a smoothie of AWESOME. The enemies are pure awesome. The bosses are pure awesome. The interactive cutscenes are pure awesome. The weapons are pure awesome. Detractors either just don\\'t get it or can\\'t or won\\'t handle the controls.The best game I have ever played and a vast improvement on previous RE titles. I was hooked from the start to the finish. The graphics are great, the plot scary, the gameplay is long and replayable and I\\'d definitely recommend buying it. Only a couple of very small nagging points, but hardly worth mentioning - ALMOST FLAWLESS...!The best resident evil game of all time, the best gamecube and ps2 game of all time, the best survival horror game of all time, the step up from ps2 to ps3 is previewed in re4. and arguably the best andm ost ground breaking game of all time, think zelda for n64my #1 game all the time Simply put, Resident Evil 4 is a landmark video game, no matter what system you play it on... Truly brilliant .............................................I really don\\'t understand what makes this game special for so many people. To me, it marks the point where resident evil starts going downhill, it\\'s no longer about clever puzzles and being low on health and ammo and feeling the next step could very well be your last, instead this is more like a shooter were you are just shooting all the time against 1000 dudes on the outside, no fear, no horror, no anything, just shooting and shooting. And they even add a shop? What the hell, is this resident evil or Counter strike? The game kinda starts to get boring after the first two massacres. Also, you have \"over the shoulder\" perspective but the character moves like in old resident evils, it\\'s SOOOO unintuitive.\\n\\nTo finish, something really annoying was he fact that the action takes place in Spain and the voice actors are clearly speaking mexican dialect, it makes me feel the game is kind of a joke, they didn\\'t even research anything about the place the game was taking place in? I only give it a 6 because graphically it\\'s kinda nice even if it\\'s old and because the storyline was good despite the mexican thing kinda taking away the immersion.I picked up this game after hearing it being touted as the best game of the year. Everyone loved it. My video store staff all played it, and raved about how great it was. When I finally tried the game, I couldn\\'t believe how much I disliked it. After seeing how many positive comments there are on this site, I\\'m still wondering what\\'s wrong with me. Hey, I don\\'t begrudge anyone for loving a game; we all have vastly different tastes. To be honest, most of the game was great. Creepy atmosphere, great visuals, compelling story. But the stumbling block for me was a big one: the control system. It was so awkward that I felt like I\\'d been put at a disadvantage right from the start. Using that laser sight instead of a crosshair just didn\\'t work for me. Plus, when you draw your gun, you\\'re frozen where you stand. For anyone who was completely at ease with the control, I can see why you loved the game so much. Personally, I guess I just love the pure shooter games like Halo 2 so much, that I find other types of control systems too jarring.RE 1 and 2 were clearly major hits that propelled the series into almost countless novels, comic books, movies, merchandise and of course all the spin-off games. Once the series made it to RE2, Capcom of course released RE 3, which wasn\\'t hated... but it was boring. Which is probably the worst insult you can give to a video game. At least if you hate something you are mad because you wanted something else or something more. It was clear to Capcom that just using the original formula of survival horror wasn\\'t going to work for RE4. This is where everything changed for the series, and quite dramatically, not minor.\\n\\nIt was the first time ammo conservation was too easy, especially for a seasoned RE player. The voice acting in this one was quite bad, considering how it was their first triple A release. The Spanish characters speak using some generic English accent and often say \\'bloke\\', which is an Australian term. According to Americans, all people outside of America (Capcom\\'s translation team) are a conglomerate of random things merely outside of America.I  get that the voice acting in RE1 was horrible, but the funding was very low and it was a game from 1996, not 2005.\\n\\nThe game was far from scary as it was trying too hard to entertain. Seeing \"zombies\" place traps and pick up chainsaws turned the initial (and anticipated) opening experience from bread and butter zombie fighting to just silly, over-the-top, juvenile attempts at horror. As the game progressed on, it shifted into an even worse, bad, pre-juvenille Halloween scare-show that your parents would take you to. Every monster was trying too hard to scare you, and that just defeated the purpose immediately. What made the originally RE games scary was the remote feeling of being left behind with zombies, not on some kind of freak show where monsters from every bad 80\\'s movie keep calling you over to look at them like an attention starved drama queen.\\n\\nAnd the I think the worst insult I can give this game is that it was BORING. I couldn\\'t bring myself to play it after 10 hours or so. Capcom just took a giant dookie on this game, and copied the same crap that Konami was doing for Resident Evil (\"epic\" boss fights against giants, cinema like cut scenes which make no sense in a survival horror game). It was Capcom\\'s all out attempt to re-make a game that was amazing when it first came out and when challanged with making something new and good again they failed both times. First with RE:3, which was just a boring, hastily put together copy of RE:2, and then with RE:4 which was just a re-done franchise and almost near copy of every  generic PS2 action game.It\\'s the same game as you saw on the \\'Cube, with more extra\\'s. but the graphics and sound detail sabotage the game in alot of ways. Attention to detail is RE4\\'s selling points, so why sabotage it with low polygon counts, decreased texture detail, and PRE-RENDERED cutscenes? It\\'s overall a rent, but a buy if you have no other way to play it.The game is OK. It has good plot, gameplay (but very downgraded compared to the old ones) and OK graphics. A bad note for the graphics: RE4 for PS2 is just a port. That\\'s why it has less graphics than GC version, so, the graphics aren\\'t so good. 5.5 for me.*Sigh* How the hell do i start...? Oh, yes! RE4 is the worst piece of survival horror crap ever! Seriously, critics! Were you high when playing this game? 96 point average?! What the hell?! The game is so flawed i could use it as toilet paper! Why is the game so terrible? Well, to start, the QTEs. They give you no time to react and brutally punishes you for wanting to enjoy a cutscene! Seriously, Capcom! You could at least warn us! At least you had the sense to either make us start QTEs of our own accord (like in boss fights) or you have time to react in RE6. Plus, I thought RE6 was an amazing game! Oh, and let\\'s not forget \\'Leon. Leon! LEOOOOOOON!!!!\\' I hate Ashley\\'s guts. SCREW THIS AWFUL GAME!This game is very disappointing when compared to earlier Resident Evil games. First of all, it\\'s not a survival horror; you have a bunch of ammo and health throughout the game, rather it is a shooter game. Second, there is no atmosphere; it has no or few horror elements. Details like merchant, items falling from enemies (not zombies), yellow herbs (superhuman health increasement) etc. ruin it all together. Third, plot is in my opinion stupid and has nothing to do with the prequels. Fourth - I really hate Hollywood details and cliches in this game.\\nBut still, if you like shooting and blowing up masses, you should play this \"survival horror\".… ExpandOverrated, boring game that fully discrases the name of resident evil. Capcom took there fans and took a complete dookie on there face and smeared it around! This is a terrible game. Its not even an RE GAME! WOW! Its got Leon And Ada... Woopty doo, its still not worthy of bearing the name Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4 should of been something completely different. This is stupid. Buy Resident Evil Outbreak, Resident Evil Code veronica, or Resident evil Operation Raccoon City INstead!This game looks like a piece of crap on ps2. because the gamecube version was so good. ps2 is going to ruin it like it did with all the resident evils. I have it on gamecube so i am not going to wait for a version with crappy graphics on ps2. This is one of teh best games ever made, but on gamecube, not on ps2. ps2 sucksWhen Resident Evil 4 first released back 2005, Gameplay turn from Good to Worst since became Noobish, Story was ok part just thanks to Ada Scenes along with Wesker Scenes,\\nGameplay: 3/10\\nStory: 6/10\\nTotal: 7/10\\nI was once Die Hard Fan but stop caring Since Series become crap once Resident Evil 4 Released.A great game, albeit maybe a little overrated. Being my first Resident Evil game, the slow movement and turning was a little jarring, but I got used to it. The shooting is very fun, the weapon selection is great, the graphics are awesome, and the sound is pretty good, but some of the dialogue is very cheezy. An excellent game? Yes. Best action game of all time? Not likely.Could\\'ve been great, but the lack of multiplayer and co-op mode makes RE4 a single-player experience only hermits can enjoy. It\\'s a shame because there was plenty of potential. Now, RE4 is nothing but a pseudo-FPS (1 player to boot) with an unoriginal plotline.I can\\'t believe that this game got such a great rating for Gamecube,there is  nothing really that special about this version of Resident evil. I found the graphics really nice( lots of outdoor environments) but the bad controls simply took any enjoyment out of it (for me anyway) and why is it so difficult to kill these enemy\\'s? ... even when shot directly in the head, they continue to advance???    I\\'m a huge Resident evil fan, I loved the past games (except the outbreak series) and movies but I\\'ll pass on this one, it\\'s nothing but frustration...what a disappointment!!!Because of insane critical praise I tried to play RE4 at least a dozen times between GC & PS2. Because of the worst aiming controls ever, I have concluded this is the most overrated game ever. I\\'m used to playing games where you can actually move with a weapon drawn, and L stick is always move, and R stick is camera/view. Having to use L stick to aim once you draw a weapon and being rooted to your position is clumsy, difficult to get used to, and what ruined any chance of me enjoying this game. Try Splinter Cell Chaos Theory and you\\'ll understand why I couldn\\'t tolerate RE4.This games is brilliant! One of my faourites and I have completed it, but started playing it again straight after in the new outfit! Truely magical!This game is simply amazing. The camera angles put you right in the action. That combined with the great controls, commands, 100 out of 10 point graphics, logic requirements, and just plain awesome storyline, wepons, and minigames makes this game 1,000,000 out of 10 in my opinion.Simply put, this game is as easy as performing brain surgery.Even in the very beginning of the game, there is little to no room for error. Despite what people say about this being an accessible game, if you aren\\'t a RE fan or a fan of action 3rd person shooters, you\\'ll have trouble with this game. Casual gamers beware. The lack of ammo you find forces you to aim at vital spots, but that\\'s a little hard when possessed spanish zombies and monsters are swarming right at you. At first, you\\'ll want to aim for the head and it saves you ammo, but later in the game when you shoot enemies in the head, a parasite pops out which you then have to spend even more ammo blasting it. With that in mind, you\\'ll want to avoid headshots. Most people have nothing but good words for the \"behind the shoulder\" view, but I thought it was clunky and very hard to move Leon. You\\'ll be constantly moving around trying to find where you are, since the camera moves when you move. Since you can\\'t move when aiming with a gun or knife, you\\'ll be running all over the place out of harm\\'s way only to aim again and then run away again. Finally, the parts of the game where you escort Ashley are very tedious, as she can\\'t defend herself and you are forced to rescue her when (and that\\'s a definite WHEN) she gets carried away by an enemy. On a good note, the graphics are pretty good and the script and dialogue are deliciously cheesy and fun. The campaign is fairly long, and the extra bonus missions will keep you playing for a while (if you haven\\'t already given up from the difficulty like I have).We say to a game its a good game if you played it through and say \"that money and time I spent on this game wasn\\'t in vein\" and that what happened I played through the game and I liked it,however,I played the previous resident evil games which was also good and I said the quote after playing it,but resident evil 4 was nothing like it.Awesome shooter, but there\\'s nothing horror or scary which was a bit disappointment to me. That\\'s why I give it a 7,its an awesome shooter but it has nothing to do with the style of the previous games and as said above I liked it and thats enough for me to give it a good point.The best game I\\'ve ever played bar none. Yes, its better than any of the GTA\\'s or God of war 2 even. Addictive, atmospheric, and satisfying gameplay. It constantly exceeded my high expectations and the difficulty level was pitch perfect. If resident evil 5 is as good i\\'ll finally upgrade to PS3.This game deserve a perfect 10 with it\\'s wicked gameplay and tight controls.This game has intense action, hard but fun bosses,amazing guns and easy controls. I love the chainsaws when they cut off your head! There are so many fun secrets to die!!! re4 is the best game ever!!Don\\'t waste your money.  Buy a gamecube and play it the way it was intended to be played.  Even if you already have a ps2 and you don\\'t have a gamecube, you would be well advised to get a gamecube and play the gamecube version.  But maybe if you have bad eyesight you won\\'t notice the inferiority of this version.Seeing the hype the game created, critics\\' high review points, and actually playing the the game, the only thing that actually comes to mind is that \"man, PS2 already has so many of such titles out there, like Ghosthunter, Primal, MGS 4 or Shadow of the Colossus in which much emphasis is on exploration...why keep this one one in such a high prestige? \" the answer is simple, that this IS one of the best games on GameCube and the best on GC is really not the best on PS2, PS2\\'s first party titles has already blown everything to bits that no design based game on Xbox or GC could compare to them. Now I am sure what GC\\'s power is based upon, simple ideas that originated at the start of the generation, and PS2 already has left that mark a long time ago... Still, this is the best Resident Evil out there but it certainly isn\\'t the 9 or 10 rating suited, the graphics of \\'resident evil : dead aim\\' were far more sharper and superior to it, what critics said was a bias that the graphics on the GC were more greater than PS2\\'s, for this game is a PORT, and not a REMAKE, that the system could not have had picked up the detail. Everything from the GC version is fully here, and man are these the best game graphics on GC !?Dull, over hyped game Im glad I didnt buy. Borrowed it off a friend after he\\'d got caught up in the resi butt kissing. Trust me, If you havent bought this yet, dont. Its dull, clunky, soulless and dull some more. The only plus point is that it has more extras than the Cube version but dont let that tempt you, it just means more life sucking and the Cube ones probably much cheaper by now so get that one if your desperate. Nice enough graphics but its mostly all sloshed over with shades of brown. Just forget it. Go get God of War or pay the heating bill or something.To the person who said \"way better than the gamecube version\" are you joking or was that serious. I have completed both versions and can say that the Gamecube version is better overall. If u have both systems get the cube version. Still a great game though.I dont\\'t know. When I started playing it, I was shocked. The first ten hours were amazing. But, while the game was evolving, I felt like it was too long. With more or less the same situations, the same enemies. I repeat, I don\\'t know: a great game, but not completely.Was I playing the same game!?! The graphics, story, and action are horribly bland. The dialoge is incredibly awful, especially the radio conversations with the baddies. Most importantly, the controls are the worst ive seen for a third person shooter, ever. I sure as hell hope the US Army doesnt teach our guys to stop and stand still while they shoot (or maybe they do...) and ive noticed the developers made Leon alot like Snake off Metal Gear Solid to make him seem badass. All and all, overrated garbage.I don\\'t like PS2 games but this one I liked. Which is not to say it\\'s perfect. It starts off as survival horror and then about half way through, it turns into Quake or Aliens or some sci-fi movie. So I liked the first half, not so much the second half. Plus the inability to go back to previous chapters is a huge let down. This ought to be doable since it\\'s all one contiguous world. Nonetheless, it\\'s addictive because the save points are spaced really close to each other. You keep on going for one more save point. Game took me about 26 hours to complete. One good thing is that you can replay the game with all of your advanced-level weapons. Too bad the game doesn\\'t provide enough incentives to play a second round. The only gameplay element that was uncharacteristically poor was Krauser, where you had a three minute time limit and his pattern was impossible to figure out. Graphics are stunning for a PS2 game. Gameplay is 100000x less frustrating than God of War or MGS2. If they ended the game after you saved the girl, I would have given this ten out of ten. They just dragged the story out way too long.How does a game with such miserable controls rank so high?  Like others I\\'m asking myself if I played the same game as the people giving this a 10.  Have you guys ever played a game with GOOD controls to compare it with?  All the difficulty in this game stems from the retarded controls, NOT the enemies.  It\\'s like playing a piano wearing boxing gloves.  I don\\'t get it.I too was sucked in by the hype generated by this game. It looked so cool and so easy to play when I watched the in-game videos. When I actually got ahold of the game, the controls were clunky and the difficulty was just too much to handle. I suppose if I stuck with it for awhile, I might gain a better understanding of what makes this game tick. But I don\\'t see myself doing that anytime soon. Give me a perfectly tuned control scheme, then you can throw tough enemies my way. Don\\'t make the controls the foundation for a games difficulty.The game is fantastic It has better graphics than previous versions of RE. There are some unique melee moves that each character has. You can upgrade your weapons and/or buy stronger ones. My favorite part of the game comes when you come in contact with a boss. or a cut-sceen because you have to press a combination of buttons to dodge their attacks. (such as L1+L2) or you will die. If it wasnt for this feature RE4 would be just an ordinary horror game.This game sucks, plain and simple. As an \"action\" game it is hopelessly dull, as a survival horror game, it is, amazingly, not scary at all. The only challenge in defeating the endless and tedious hordes of opponents is trying to actually competently fire a gun using the game\\'s horrendous controls. As someone on this site already said, you\\'re not supposed to base a game\\'s challenge on poor controls. The game dips further into ridiculousness with the \"Tap X to run away from a rolling boulder\" segments which reek like something out of a PSX game that was produced for 10 cents and sold about 28 copies worldwide. And can anyone tell me what\\'s surprising, haunting, scary or unpredictable about a game where at any time you only have to press the Triangle button to access a fully fleshed-out map which details your current destination, the next save point, which doors are locked and unlocked, which keys you have, and more? And what of the so-called story? If you run into any non-enemy characters, you\\'ll see 3 minutes of nothing notable, occasionally interrupted by very poor \"one-liners\" from our \"hero\" Leon Kennedy. Or maybe after twenty morbidly dull minutes of farcical combat, you\\'ll be interrupted by a radio segment where you talk to the most unconvincing operations commander you\\'ve ever seen. ItThis has to be the best game made for the PS2, from the multiple replays to the extremely well designed cut-scenes and the multiple enemy types, this game is better than most of its competitors. Espectially when you beat it and then there are the Ada missions and the Mercenaries missions. Best game EVER!!!Right, okay. Deus Ex, Half Life, RTCWolfenstein, etc.: these games had been out for 3 - 6 years before RE4 and the dev team STILL couldn\\'t get a good control scheme down. Its veeeeeeeeery simple: left stick = move, right stick = look. How do you **** that up? By going with a control scheme 5 years older that should never have existed to begin with. Terrible VO, plotholes beyond measure, occasionally overly difficult enemies, but if you can get past all that, its pretty damn fun.\\n\\nI was tempted to give this game a zero to balance out all the undue adulation, but that would be giving in to reactionary polarization. This is just an honest review with an honest score.Resident Evil 4 has some very good game modes. It\\'s kind of puzzling, but it\\'s very good. This game gives you hundreds of hours of great gameplay. This game can be a little cheap at times, but its great 8/10.Although this is the review for the PS2 version which is considerably poorer than the Gamecube version, this still warrants a perfect score simply because although the game doesn\\'t seem as crisp as the original Gamecube exclusive it is still absolutely brilliant even in the 2010 five years on. The reason for people who have played the Gamecube version to buy this is because you can pick it up for a very cheap price now and you get a brilliant extra mode involving Ada Wong that fits into the game perfectly and its clear that the developers obviously planned this, because if they hadn\\'t surely it shouldn\\'t have been this good, and extra clothes and weapons for you to use. Ok enough about the bonus stuff. There is 20 hours of gameplay to be enjoyed here for first time players, when I first went through it I done it in just under 17 hours, and with all the special weapons I must have set some kind of record in completing it in exactly 2 hours and 43 minutes. Please post a review stating whether you have done the game in less time. Brilliant characters also with great facial animations and some of the most epic boss battles ever, none of them disapoint. Onto the mercenaries which to be honest could have been a game on its own if there had been a couple more levels thrown into it. Check this game out you won\\'t be dissapointed at all. Absolutely the best horror game ever made, and right up there with the best game ever along with the new games. An absolute gem of game. Buy, Buy, Buy!!!!!!!!!The only reason i haven\\'t sold my ps3. This is just a great game I have played RE 1,2 and 5 besides this one and this is definitely my favorite. While some say it\\'s not as scary as the previous games in the series and I agree, I have to admit that I was like 10 when I played them and they were so freaking dificult because of a crappy camera, aiming and movement that i think the only reason I got scared was because i knew I was going to be eaten by some zombies at any moment. Anyway this game has it\\'s cool scary moments and a creepy atmosphere that can\\'t be overlooked, so at the end I keep coming back to play this game once in a while now that I have beaten the **** out of RE5 and platinum\\'d it, because RE4 is just better.THE BEST SURVIVAL HORROR GAME OF ALL TIME!!!!!Before this game I viewed Resident Evil as an outdated and bland series but this game brought the sagging series back into the limelight and showed there is still some life(no pun intended)in this series.The story follows Leon S. Kennedy on his quest to save the president\\'s daughter.This has the quintessential \"bad\" B-horror movie plot and I love the cheesiness of the dialogue and overall story.Just because there are cheesy lines does not make the script lame.All the characters are expertly drawn and have a lot of personality.As you journey through this hellhole of a place you will a encounter a variety of settings such as the Spanish village,industrial areas,a huge and illustrious castle,different cavern areas,and plenty of others.The game gives you many ways to approach gameplay.Your equipped with a mix of handguns,sniper rifles,automatic weapons,shotguns,grenades,and not to mention your awesome knife.You will be put in this scenarios and you\\'ll have to devise your own strategies and battle plans to survive.The enemy A.I. is also very intelligent.They will work together and use a variety of items to bring you to your knees.The action is frantic and occurs very often,but even the parts that aren\\'t action oriented are so atmospheric that you will be to afraid to move on the next area.I\\'ve only scratched the surface of why this game is so amazing.So here is a list of Pros and Cons(there are very few Cons).    Pros:Awesome graphics,cool storage system ,the Merchant ,all the different environments,creepy atmosphere,behind the shoulder look,accurate and fun aiming system,the constant claustrophobic feeling, intelligent and brutal A.I,EPIC boss fights!!,awesome cheesy dialogue and story,wonderful sound,addictive and varied gameplay,fun weapons,well drawn characters,awesome unlockables(PS2 version),will not disappoint gore lovers,protecting Ashley missions are actually enjoyable,fluid controls, andbasically everything.Cons:Puzzles and switching weapons can be tedious at times.RE4 is among the best that the PS2 has ever had to offer. I just beat the main campaign (about 20 hours long) and it\\'s fantastic. It\\'s action packed, thrilling, and while the actual scares were few and far between, the ones that were present were very effective. I\\'ve seen lots of complaints about the controls. I suppose it\\'s a matter of taste, because the controls felt perfect to me. My one complaint, and it\\'s not even much of a complaint, is the script. The voice acting is solid, but the dialogue itself is fairly clicheed, and sometimes just plain cheesy. Doesn\\'t matter. Once you beat the campaign, there\\'s a crapload of unlockables and extra game modes. If you own a PS2, you must own this game.Made this **** Series good.I recall one of my favourite Survival Horror games EVER, Sweet Home, this comes \"Semi-Close\" to that.Fixed the terrible gameplay and camera, and that terrible plot.Some people don\\'t like this game, lemme explain why : Resident Evil is TERRIBLE. I Mean TERRIBLE.This game took out the **** and replaced it with pancake Syrup, but without that terrible tasting bull****, it ain\\'t the same.I\\'m not a fan of survival horror and don\\'t care much for shooting games, but this isn\\'t a survival horror compared to previous Resident Evil games. The removal of the survival aspect has probably disappointed fans of the series, but this game is challenging even still. I really enjoyed this game because of memorable set pieces, bosses and even normal creatures and the game still gives a sense of tension. Still remember it well after years since completion.The last/best atmospheric game of the classic franchise. The number four part of the franchise, surprise the player with a magical tension , and solid gameplay. Set in Spain is also a great move for the series, expanding the setting is always important.  Even the graphics seems to be comparable to games of the 360 and PS3 very detailed and fresh. Best in the series after 1 and 2 .Perrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfection.This is my favorite Resident Evil game because it\\'s by far the scariest. When I first played this game I was so nervous that I was sweating - then again I was 14 or so, and not very experienced in horror games. This is the first Resident Evil in the series to do something different than the Fixed Angle thing - which to some extent made it less frightening, but in another made it much more involving. A pro that this game has that over the others is that  the enemies aren\\'t necessarily that over the top - they\\'re simple looking (except for maybe the bosses). The fear introduced is from men and women who don\\'t appear to have anything wrong with them - though their clothing is way out of style (like from the early 1900s or something). They only grimace and don\\'t look all that pretty - oh, well, they also attack you with knives and farm gear, and eventually chainsaws and even further on with gatling guns. There are monsters, but in this they aren\\'t pulsating or as cartoon-like as they are in previous and future games. Resident Evil 5 sort of went over board with the monsters to the point where they looked less frightening (sometimes there\\'s more through simplicity). What\\'s also great is this game is directly related to the series and yet is indirectly related because it\\'s an entirely new premise. It\\'s definitely my favorite of the series and is lots of fun - much more survival is in this one over RE5.This game ruined Resident Evil series. It replaced Zombies with parasites, and removed anything that resembled puzzles. It is action game nothing else.If you have played the previous Resident Evil games than this game is almost nothing like its predecessors because they have made alot of changes to this game. For starters there are no longer fixed camera angles in areas the camera is now at the back of the characters, most of the guns have laser sighting and scope to help with aiming and the zombies have been replaced by humans who are mind controlled and infected by Las Plagas. All these changes reduce the scare factor of the game compared to its predecessors but also makes the gameplay more action orientated, higher paced and makes the controls more responsive and making the A.I more diverse. The Ganados the infected humans you fight in the game are alot more smarter than the zombies and the way they gang up on you and attack you is alot different than the predictable zombie grabbing and blood sucking from the previous games. The Ganados can hit you with their melee weapons either by stabbing you or throwing it when they are far away and even throwing dynamites at you. On top of that those villagers also react differently to your gun shots shooting in the leg will make them limp, shooting them on their arms will cause them to drop their weapons, the Ganados can also get stunned during the combat which will allow the player to go near them and perform some special unarmed moves. All these changes and additions make the gameplay more fun, diverse and less repetitive compared to the previous Resident Evil games. The players finds alot more ammunition and healing items in this game as the enemies that are killed almost always drop the healing items, ammo and money and treasure as well which the player can use to buy and upgrade weapons from a merchant who appears throughout the game. The game also has some interactive cutscenes that make you think you are actually involved in then game even when you are just watching the cutscenes which is also a great addition. There will be also points in the game where you go through areas while protecting a defenseless girl who moves with you she can\\'t fight but she can get hurt and you can use your herbs and First aid sprays to heal her and she will also be helping you solve some puzzles in the game these levels of the game may be frustrating at times but they are still fun and entertaining. The scare factor may have been toned down but that doesn\\'t mean RE4 did not give me the creeps there were alot of points in the game that made me jump and scared me s**tless the part where you first fight the underwater monster, the part where you fight the El-Gigante, the part where you fight the bugs in the sewer and specially the part where you first fight the Re-generator all those moments just scared the crap out of me the first time the played this game. However the scary moments in this game are far less than there were in the previous Resident Evil games. The story is really good despite the only connection being between it and the previous RE being the characters Leon, Ada and Wesker and the mentioning of Umbrella otherwise its a completely different story. The story is far from epic but it is still well told and well written. Creating a chemical to control the humans than taking over america and taking over the world may sound too gimmicky and may have also been a used up formula for the stories in games but it was executed well here. The graphics are really good considering it is ps2 ofcourse ps2 has done better with God of War and MSG games but still the graphics look very good however the ps2 graphics still don\\'t hold a candle up to the Gamecube version but that is because GC had a better graphic card the the PS2 and graphics don\\'t totally make a game. The game\\'s music and sound effects are just superb always suit the environments and the sound effects do a good job of building up tensions and giving the creeps. The voice acting is good however the dialogue can just be cheesy and corny at times. Apart from the main story the game also has the awesome and fun Mercenary Mode, Assignment Ada (a small mission for ada) and the ps2 version has two new extras which were not in the GC version the Movie Browser where all the game\\'s cutscenes can be viewed and the Separate Ways in which you play as Ada where she explains her motives for being involved in the main campaign. These extras just makes the players come back for playing this game for hours and hours and having fun and really increasing the game\\'s already high replay value and lasting appeal. Overall Resident Evil 4 is a great achievement on the part of CAPCOM. 9.5/10the hard work and research behind this game is remarkable, shinji mikami and team spent 11 days in europe to recreate a very real european experience in the village and the castle. Indeed if u visit a european castle u would see an eerie similarityWhen i played this game i was very young and it was one of my first games.So it all was pretty new for me and i think that made it extra awesome for me because this is still one of my favorite games. And leo still is the king of Resident evil world. And i here many people complaining about the control system but i think it is great.Resident Evil 4 is without a doubt the best game in the series!! The mix between Horror and Action is spot on in this game.. The story is AMAZING! the gameplay mechanics are really good for a PS2 game, and the replay value is really HIGH! especially the HD version which has all the extras from past versions. All in all Resident Evil 4 is an AMAZING! game.. You MUST own it if you like action/Horror gamesA triumphant re-invention of the resident evil series, resident evil 4 is a very imaginative and fresh new look in the survival horror genre in general. The attention to detail to the overall package is outstanding, with a perfectly paced story that keeps bringing unexpected surprises in both the storytelling and the gameplay. this is a great feat especially considering the main story is more or less 15 hours long, not counting the bonus material that extends the fun with minigames and side stories. level design is extremely well done and atmospheric, character design is intriguing, the music emphasizes the horror produced by the atmosphere, and the gameplay involves more than simply running and shooting thanks to small but effective variations and some exploration. My only small complain is that while the voice acting is very professionally produced, some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy for a game with serious themes. perhaps the few bad lines of dialogue are intentional from developer capcom as a trowback to the horrendous dialogue in the earlier resident evil games but this is only a very minor thing. A slightly more significant complain i have is that the control scheme is just a bit dated and slow, but effective nonetheless.',\n",
       " \"The story of the game is incredible and exciting, the characters are very well developed, the villains are spectacular.\\nWith scary scenarios that combine perfectly with the survival horror genre, in addition to a perfect soundtrack, nostalgic, that fully matches every moment of the game, that speaks to you, makes you feel scared, desperate, thrilled, as if it were you within the game.\\nResident Evil Code Veronica, for me, is the best game in the series, which will be forever in the memory of fans, being a reference in history, setting and soundtrack.Absolutely phenomenal, my favorite game of all time. I've played it countless times and to this day I still enjoy it as if it's my first time.Taking place right after RE2/RE3, Code Veronica combines 2 out of the 4 previous lead protagonist in Claire Redfield as she tracks down her brother Chris in the arctics. Dreamcast version was amazing.Unbelievable, one of the best games in history, without a doubt, the best for me after Resident Evil 4this is the best RE game and the peak of the dreamcast era. best story, super puzzles and the characters are well chosen. it would be a shame if Capcom wouldn't remake/reimagine that masterpiece\",\n",
       " 'This is one of the best games in the genre, and of the best games for the PS1 ever. It\\'s slightly more action-oriented than the more scary RE1, but it doesn\\'t make it lesser of a game. The action-horror atmosphere actually fits very well, but maybe it could have been slightly better if it was a teeny tiny bit more scary. Who knows. The music and the sound effects are excellent and gives the game an eerie atmosphere. The dialogue is kinda cheesy, but that\\'s the way I like it. It has a lot of puzzle-solving which is a good thing, and it has interesting environments and characters. 2 separate characters with 2 separate scenarios each (granted the scenarios aren\\'t very different from one another), and an extra mini-game with Hunk and Tofu gives this game a great replay-value. Plenty of interesting bosses including: alligator, Mr X., different mutations of William Birkin, G-Virus\\' \"Offspring\", the Moth (although not really a boss). 1-2 more boss-fights had been perfect though. I think Chief Irons had made a good boss, imagine a boss-fight with a human who isn\\'t infected by some kind of virus, blasting away with a hunting rifle, and setting off traps (he enjoyed hunting) during the fight. A boss-fight against one of Hunk\\'s team members would have been nice too. A G-virus mutated mercenary with a machine gun. Plenty of different monsters such as: a few different kind of zombies (but where are all the children zombies?), 2 kind of lickers, 2 kind of walking plants, spiders, dogs (where are all the cats though?), crows. Cats and snakes (there are only sissy snakes, and few of them) would have been cool. Some kind of different bird would have been nice, since there are only crows/ravens/whatever. Summary: A solid 10, it is everything that a Resident Evil should be, and I will NEVER get tired of this game. I still remember the first time I saw this game, it was when I watched my friend play the RE2 demo, which his older brother had got from his copy of RE 1 Dir. Cut. I was awe-struck and deeply fascinated when i watched my friend play it. It\\'s more than 10 years later now, and the fascination of this game hasn\\'t decreased,… ExpandI do not have to say anything. But i need to write one hundred and fifty characters. i think my score can describe it.................................… ExpandA king among survival horror game genre. A feast for those who like to be scared and a must buy for RE 1 fans. The atmosphere is brilliant, gameplay may not suit everybody since the control scheme is deliberately frustrating. Add to that constant strive for ammo, zombies and mutatns jumping out from nowhere and the creepy enviroments and you have a **** for making you constantly scared ****To me Resident Evil 2 and 4 are tied for the best and my personal favorite, not just because Leon is awesome in both, but the gameplay was just wow. I literally can play these two games over and over and over. They\\'re that addicting. I love them. Now focusing on 2. 2 starts out where Leon is supposed to go to the RPD for a party. First day on the job is always supposed to be the worst anyway, well yeah it was a bad day for Leon. The opening scenes put you in suspense and it never stopped. When it got quite I got real scared as a kid not going to lie. I was terrified, but I beat the game. I even bought it for my ps3. This game also really intrigued me. It was a long long campaign. I just love this game so much it\\'s ridiculous. 2 and 4 of the Resident Evil franchise are my favorite games of all time.Long long ago, when the Resident Evil series was an adventure/horror series and not an action/shooter series, Capcom actually knew how to make good games. Resident Evil 2 is one of them. It\\'s plot is simple, yet intriguing. The game is one of the most atmospheric games of this era and even though it\\'s quite old, you can still tell that it is well designed. The gameplay is excellent as well. Need I say more? This game is a classic.A great sequence of the first game, introduces others great characters, with a good storyline and graphics, this makes Resident Evil one big franchise in the world of games.Resident evil 2 is the best resident evil of franchise\\none of the scariest game of my childhood\\ni love it\\nis one my favourite games of ps1 and n64\\ni love itsurvival horror wise, this is the best game in the franchise. the scariest, the most challenging, and of course the tyrant, which isn\\'t quite as cool as nemesis, but whatever. quite possibly the greatest survival horror game everthis ar one of of the best game of the original ps1 and one the best survival horror of all time i recomend it if you like the horror games and great classic gamesCapcom stepped up their game with Resident Evil 2 and created an amazing game that is one of the best if not the best in the series. A must play game.For me Resident Evil 2 remains the best game in the series (other than arguably the fourth installment but that took the series in a different direction) and easily ranks amongst the best games of its generation. Building upon the foundations of the original very few titles to this day have been able to invoke such a sense of dread and isolation, the game making brilliant use of fixed camera angles to make sure the play never knows what is around the next corner.\\n\\nOf course the graphics and some of the gameplay elements, such as \\'bullet sponge\\' bosses and B-movie scripts, may be outdated now but if you own a PSone or PS2 this is still worth digging out for an idea of what a survival horror game should be like.Gave the original Resident Evil a 9 also, but I do like Resident Evil 2 a little bit more.  This game improves and builds on all the the greatness of the first.  Still hate the controls.Absolutely fantastic. It improved on the original in every way and tried many new ideas that have yet to be topped. One of the few games that has successfully made me jump and kept me on the edge of my seat. Great story, fantastic characters, brilliant visuals and highly memorable gameplay. Overall: While it is my favorite of the series, it still isn\\'t the best and does suffer from some minor flaws, but at least the voice acting has improved to tolerable levels.The best part in the game series is Resident Evil in my opinion. This game was released in 1998 and still knows how to surprise and the most important thing for the genre of this game is to scare !!Not many franchises get sequels that improve on the first game in every aspect.\\nThis is what makes Resident Evil 2 so special. Improved visuals, sounds, voices, FMV\\'s.\\n2 entirely different characters to choose from, yeah that is what is available to you at the start of Resident Evil 1, but Resident Evil 2 links the two players together into Scenario A and Scenario B.\\nIf played the conventional way (LEON A, then onto CLAIRE B) you will get the best experience from Resident Evil 2, however you are not limited to that way, you can Claire A and LEON B.\\n\\nFor the more experienced gamer you are able to achieve an A rank (European & USA release only, JAPAN is far easier and gives an S rank)\\nThe rank is awarded to the player with the best play through of the scenario\\'s, complete both play through\\'s under 3 hours  and you unlock goodies! you also get a 3rd scenario known as 4th survivor in which you control Hunk (the guy in the William Birkin FMV sequence who asks for the G-Virus sample where he injects himself)\\n\\nIf you finish the game 6 times going from scenario to scenario you unlock TOFU which is a joke scenario where you play as a piece of Tofu.\\n\\nThis sequel brought so much for us RE fans that it deserves number 1 spot in my mind.\\n\\nThis game has excellent versions other than the original release too, and my personal fave being the Dreamcast release which is the PC port with the most features (if you exclude N64\\'s EX files & gore changer)\\nThe Playstation got the Dual Shock edition which makes the Dual Shock controller compatible with RE2 and gives the rumble function, it also includes Extreme Battle mode.\\n\\nThe DC release has an arrange mode like the Dual Shock edition except has Expert and Nightmare modes which are the hardest version of RE2 on any release bar the PC version (PC port to DC).\\n\\nFor the best FMV quality you want either the Gamecube or PC SourceNext editions, however SN version is Japan only and the Gamecube version lacks game play features from the DC / PC releases.\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this read, thinking of playing it? it\\'s an experience you won\\'t forget!Check out top 10 scary moments and all bosses in Leon (A) scenario here:\\nhttp://youtu.be/297OpjJl8mA\\n\\nAbout a game: it is easier than RE1, but it provides more action. Also you have 4 possible scenarios (Leon A, Leon B, Claire A, Claire B). No need to speak about atmosphere, it is as it should be; great!\\nThere are riddles that aren\\'t hard, but give a nice touch to the game. In the police station, a place where you run into while being chased by zombies at a beginning, you try to find a shelter thinking it is safe, but how wrong can you be... I don\\'t know what to say about this game and be original. It can\\'t be written briefly, you simply need to play it by yourself to find out what\\'s this game like.This was the first survival horror I played and it will always hold a place in my heart. The game overall was an instrument of perfection (well of course there\\'s the cliche voice acting) and having multiple scenarios on multiple discs made this a thunderous experience. Most notable for introducing Leon and Claire, as well as the infamous Licker.i remember the first day i played this 15 years ago. i remember those exact words, (we finally beat it!) only 5 years old when i first beat re2 and 3. resident evil series will always be on my game list, even when ps5 and 6 come out. people gona play Cod Bo 3 and 4 while im playing games not for entertainment, but also to reminisce to. I will never forget who Capcom is.The best survival horror and the best psx ever made.\\nThis is not a formal review, but i need to say that Resident Evil 2 was the best game that i played in my life, from my childhood, in my old ps1. and now years after i still loving that masterpiece, my score is 9.5, but i give it the 10, it\\'s a shame that resident evil 6 is a disaster with no horror, those where the days. I am looking forward to play Biohazard Value Plus for the Dreamcast, this game make me love the ps1 and teach me what the true horror means. Thank you Capcom.Jay D.... You gave this game a zero. Seriously. A zero. People like you who should\\'ve been born with no hands so they can\\'t get access to a computer. The least you could do is give information as to WHY you feel this game deserves a 0. But no. You just say \"the original is still the best\" and slap a 0 on it. While I really think this game deserves a solid 9, I\\'m giving it a 10 because every little bit helps to make up for your stupidity.Resident Evil 2 elevated everything the original Resident Evil did with a better story, gameplay and better graphics. I always was at the edge of my seat while playing Resident Evil 2 because of its tense, well-made puzzles and satisfying gameplay.Loved this game when I was a child and it first came out, and I still love it now. A masterpiece and forerunner in survival horror. If for whatever reason you haven\\'t picked this gem up, then you need to and find out what you\\'ve been missing out on!Resident evil 2 has great graphics for the time including amazing cut scenes. Best game play of the entire RE franchise with 4 being a close 2nd. Tons of replay value with different scenarios and modes to try. excellent balance between you and your enemies including the lickers which are new to this game. The survival is difficult but not unfair. although it may be considered easier than 1 or 3, it isn\\'t easy. The game has lots of atmosphere and scares to keep you on your toes through the entire experience. With all the awards and replay value this game will keep you coming back until you realize that this is not just an amazing game, but a legendary one.\\n10/10My first fear of fear, that I was going to play it, but there was something that made me continue playing until the end.I played it on a small black and white TV for more inri, I think this game is one of the culprits that my view is now regular, but how well I enjoyed killing zombies, the suits that awaited you in every corner and thePuzzles resolution hooked me.One of the things I liked was that the game is alive, after seeing something that has happened in an area of the city, you return after a while, you will see that things have changed (I would love to give an example but it would be Spoiler).\\nThat said, a great game that you cannot spend the opportunity to play it.re2 is a best ps1 game, it\\'s made by capcom, in claire\\'s quest you also control sherry birkin, she\\'s a cutest character ever just like chris thorndyke from sonic x, in leon\\'s quest you also control ada wong, i recommend re2.This is arguably the best Resident Evil in the entire series and one of the best horror games ever made. Everything is perfect in this game from the atmosphere, the level design, enemies, and soundtrack. If you are looking for an amazing survival-horror game, then this is a very good choice.This was my favorite Resident Evi game. The best monster, super tyrant has always been my favorite tyrant and he was obviously the inspiration for Nemesis. Claire is one of the best female protagonists in games and this is her debut. Love the idea of a loving sibling trying to save the hero sibling who saves everyone else.… ExpandAnother resident evil good game. But the puzzles are so dumb and easy...One of the best games i\\'ve played. The Soundtrack, cutscenes, characters and history.... everything in this game is epic. Probably the best Resident Evil and one of the best games of Capcom.As ChrisM put so well this is getting a 10 for me to compensate for JayD abusing the rating system. Would have given it a 9 otherwise. This game frightened the crap out of me and despite a lot of very annoying issues with camera angles, movement, battle gameplay etc. the atmosphere and visuals made it one of the most memorable games on the playstation.When i played this game the first time me and a friend stayed up all night to play and we were speechless of how much it kicked ass LOL this is a all time classic!i love this game PERIOD it oozes blood & challenge (no pun intended) lol anyways it is one of the best survival horror games let alone the series. yes i kid u not it is one of the best it is up there with silent hill 1 & 2, doom  3, and of course fatal frameAwesome game. 2 whole quests.This was the first survival horror game I ever played, and thus, the first game to make me anticipate nightfall for full enjoyment. Your surroundings have to be engulfed in darkness if you want your pants scared off properly, after all.  You can choose to play as one of two protagonists; Claire, sister of S.T.A.R.S. member Chris from the first game. Or Leon, who is presented with the greatest first day rookie cop assignment ever; to survive a zombie apocalypse. The game\\'s soundtrack is atmospheric, and really captures the ambience of a desolate setting, housing unfamiliar and unnatural horrors in its shadows, and a lingering hope for survival beyond those shadows. The game is a perfect compromise between shooting, puzzle-solving, and pop-up scare tactics. I also enjoy the fact that you can play a second side of the story directly after beating one disc, and vice versa. That makes for 4 different scenarios and a lot of added replay value.Played on PlayStation.\\nGameplay: GREAT.\\nStory: GREAT.\\nGraphic: GREAT.\\nMusic/Sound: GREAT.\\nDialogue: GREAT.Takes everything from the original and improves upon it. With diverse paths through the game split between two characters, each storyline is much more unique this time. Better voice acting, sharper character models and textures, tons of new weapons, and a compelling storyline split between two diverse locations make this one of my favorite games ever. If you enjoyed the original, be prepared to be blown away by all the improves to the series. Resident Evil 1-3 are all fantastic survival horror games from a bygone era of gaming that all fans of action games should play.While it doesn\\'t quite hold up today; back in 1998 this was survival horror in its prime. While Resident evil paved the way for survival horror, Resident evil 2 cemented the series reputation as king of the genre.\\n\\nResident evil 2 takes what Resident evil had achieved and extends on the formula by adding improved voice acting, a greater story, new enemies and to top it off adds replay value by unlocking different scenarios once the game has been finished, and trust me you will want to play the new scenario\\'s as that\\'s when the game gets interesting with a pre-nemesis monster that stalks you throughout the game.\\n\\nHands down a all time classicEven thought the first installment of the Resident Evil was amazing,Resident Evil 2 perfected it in all the aspects.You start as Leon S.Kennedy,a rookie police officer,who in the first day at his duty,is surviving at a zombie apocalypse.\\nGraphics-8/10\\nPlayabilitie-10/10\\nSoundtrack-10/10\\nReview by Henry4DeadThis game will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end, from start to finish. Resident Evil cannot be topped when it comes to length of a game, spookiness, or just plain not knowing what to expect. The game can be hard, but not difficult and with many different rewards for finish on different difficulties and getting a score at the end you can unlock things(I won\\'t spoil it). The game can be heart wrenching at times too, as you kind of feel like a character grows on you. The music is what makes the game even better. I mean they have perfect music for whatever scenario you\\'re in so you kind of never know what to expect, so it\\'s creepy. I cannot say enough good things about this game, so hopefully you will experience it, even 16 years later it\\'s still one of the best.Well the golden era of Resident Evil, there is a remake happening because this game captured what is truly horrifying.\\n\\nA scientist working on the G-Virus, injects the sample into himself in order to stop him dying.\\nRoams the cop station after his daughter wanting to impregnate her with G embryos. Pretty haunting and disturbing in it\\'s self. Oh and he can rival NEMESIS in his persistence.The best survival-horror game. The perfection of the franchise has been reached with this milestoneOne of, if not the most iconics entry in the Resident Evil series, this game\\'s two campaigns add fresh new takes on the story and keep the gameplay fresh.The continuation of Resident Evil trumps with better storytelling, graphics and gameplay.\\nTogether with the classic survival horror elements, a brilliant mix.\\nEspecially the trick that the run (scenario a) of one character, the run (scenario B) of the other, generates a higher reflection value.\\nHowever, some puzzles are too simple, I also find the atmosphere of RE1 as an oppressive one.Jay D.... You gave this game a zero. Seriously. A zero. People like you who should\\'ve been born with no hands so they can\\'t get access to a computer. The least you could do is give information as to WHY you feel this game deserves a 0. But no. You just say \"the original is still the best\" and slap a 0 on it. While I really think this game deserves a solid 9, I\\'m giving it a 10 because every little bit helps to make up for your stupidity.A true game of classic survival horror and not a garbage hybrid of the action and shooting genre.The Mansion seemed like the best setting, but RE2s police department isn\\'t that far behind. RE2 improves over the original ALOT. The plot, characters, and scenarios are more engaging. Gameplay tweaks fix a lot of the originals issues. Controls feel a tad more precise. The game seems to have a perfect balance of action, puzzles, and backtracking. RE2 is up there with REmake and RE4. It\\'s certainly the best Resident Evil on PSone and one of the best in the entire series.Here are my six standard game-judging questions:\\n1. Did I enjoy the game overall? Yes.\\n2. Was the game good enough to play through to completion? Yes.\\n3. Did I get a little bored and put the game down for a while to play another game in the mean time? No.\\n4. After completing the game, was it good enough to play again, even for a little while? Yes.\\n5. Was it good enough to warrant a purchase of a re-release or sequel? Yes.\\n6. Is it timeless/a classic? Meaning: Is it good enough to still play to this day? No.\\nWhat\\'s my total? 9/10!\\nNote: I am 31 years old, and a mature, respectful, unbiased gamer.Exceeding the original in every way, with improved graphics, voice acting, and game play, Resident evil 2 expands on the story first introduced in 1996\\'s Resident Evil. Set in Raccoon City, the fictional Mid-western town, we follow our heroes: Claire Redfield, on a search to find her brother, Chris, and Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie cop who comes to work on a terrible day. They find themselves in horror right away, both having to survive to the end. This game keeps with the two character selection from the first game. But, unlike the first game, the game makes you play through both characters in order to get the full ending of the game. This game is a true masterpiece.Very rarely would I give a 10/10 for any game...  but when you STILL compare every new survival horror to this one and that your childhood was marked by this video game...WELL IT DESERVES a 10.\\n\\nPeople need to judge this by pretending it\\'s 1996-1999 era and then they\\'ll realise this is probably one of the best 10 games ever made!!!\\n\\nThe story line is simple yet very intriguing. The characters weren\\'t bland and were mysterious.  The pre-rendered backgrounds are amazing!!(I prefer these then the new-gen).\\n\\nSome of the BEST things about this game was that it had an awesome atmosphere! (new-gen games fail at this).\\nI remember finding pages and diaries and reading through them and being completely immersed in the world. (the one where the guy is writing about his painful seclusion and feeling sick...not knowing how long he had left).\\nAbsolutely breathtaking!!\\n\\nCapcom should have stuck to this recipe and kept this game for NICHE audience!  Instead, they made RE5, RE6 and completely destroyed everything that was perfect about RE1,RE2.\\n\\nThis is hands down the best RE of them all.  Sorry RE4 was good but it did NOT have a story like this one did... neither did it have the HORROR aspect as well blended as this one!RE 2 I am here to pay my respects.  Best game on the RE franchise for PS1 and second of all time.\\nBetter than RE1 because of the improved graphics and story and better than RE3 because of the character/story development (just a little bit behind of RE4).\\nThis game was looking amazing back on that time considering the PS1 capacity.\\nThis is a must have/play game, it\\'s a classic for survival horror genre.The best of the old generation of RE games, outshined only by the groundbreaking 4.For its time it was a great horror/action game for Playstation. The puzzles may feel way too similar by today\\'s standards, as they mostly consist of finding yet another key for yet another set of closed doors. Also, the game becomes completely linear closer to the end (in the beginning though you spend much time running back in forth across a huge police station). The combat is pretty difficult, and most of the difficulty comes from awkward camera placement (the camera always looks at your character from some corner of the room and may not see the enemies even if they are close to your character. The story is in B-movie style, aimed at kids and teenagers. You may want to check this game out if you are interested which game the movie Resident Evil was based on :) But I\\'d still recommend playing Resident Evil 3 instead, due its better controls.LOOOOOOOOOSER That anonymous person has got to be brain dead, Resident Evil two is THE BEST R.E. game next to Resident Evil Nemesis. The ranking is R.E.3, R.E.2, R.e. C.V., R.E., then Survivor!!!!! LOOOOOOOOSER!This game still suffers from some of my problems with the first game such as the weird unnecessary inventory system and very stiff combat, but this game didn\\'t piss me off as much. In fact I enjoyed this game enough to completely overlook those flaws. It\\'s a pretty rough game but doesn\\'t feel unfair about it. Above all, it\\'s fun and probably one of the best games in the series.A real classic, atmospheric and playful is the second part of the first and zero in nowhere. Here you can tell that the game principle is dusty. The processes are always the same from part to part. You come to an eerie property and then end in some secret laboratory. From zero to part 3 always the same scheme. It is clear that the makers tried to do something different with part 4 where the demise of the series took its course. One would rather have linked the 3D third person element to the survival horror element and added a few new concept ideas, instead there was the action porridge, but that\\'s a different story. Resident Evil 2 itself is a great game with a high stipe value due to the 2 different campaigns. 2 main campaigns with Claire and Leon and 2 B campaigns with an alternative start route. In any case, a horny old school of resi, I played it through in one piece and never had boredom at any second. The only thing you could chase the game is the constant back and forth and again the same scheme as the remaining resis of its kind.A flawless game.I played this back in 1998 when it came out as a kid and boy it is a masterpiece.THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE MAGNIFICENT MIRACLE OF A GAME.Never liked it. It was too long and boring. You actually had to finish game four times (with some differences) to complete it. It tried to be copy of first RE - two characters and big place filled with zombies. Nah. It\\'s like the same game, but longer and less interesting.Good game but very hard in places and some puzzles frustrated me. Not as good as the original which I am going through again. The only thing I could find good about RE2 is claire redfield.The original is still the best...I keep hearing what people say about these Resident Evil games so I bought the full collection (1 through 3) for PS1. I HATED part 1. This one however, doesn\\'t frustrate me or make me mad. It\\'s easy to play and still provides those jumpy scares. I love having people watch me play it because I get to see them jump when a zombie comes crashing through a window or ceiling. Anyway, if you buy this game, get the dual shock greatest hits version because it has arrange mode (which if you play on rookie you can have a machine gun with infinite ammo right from the start). I still have part 3 yet to play and I am definitely looking forward to it.This suite at the first Daubasse in Zombis dates back to 1998! Very surprisingly, it works on Windows XP but in a very small window, a window of 640 × 480 on an original desk in 1080: it\\'s really small! Well, I admit that I did not try to finish, maybe we can possibly play in the full screen, I don\\'t really know ... and to speak frankly, I fight with the balls in force.\\n\\nIt is also Daubé-that anyway-that the first Resident Debil, which is not surprising on the part of the producer of Vide-Pas-Lidiques, the famous editor-developer Capcon! Fixed cameras, pre-populated sets, impossible to play the mouse (he doesn\\'t even know what it is) no controller either ... But we can nevertheless reassign the keys even if it is here \"thought\" Despite the most basic common sense ...\\n\\nNo mini-card but a card that takes the whole screen, which requires tiring back and forth ... Too limited resources, puzzles at biting moi-le-noeud, an interface generally to shit, a \"playability\" \"Heavy and entirely zero to shit ... And of course, save it on a typewriter (what?!) And only if you found an ink ribbon (but what?!?).\\n\\nIn short, a big shit like the only Capcon knows how to unmold and produce them: an unqualifiable non-maid and by-product: so there is only to hunt!It\\'s a great game in terms of survival horror elements, gunplay and general aesthetics. The boss fights were a bit awkward and the fact that Route B was more of a \"what if\" rather than a proper B scenario, left a bitter taste in my mouth. I cleared the game first with Leon and then continued with Claire. I was hoping to see the game from her point of view but instead I got to do almost the same things that I did with Leon, as if he never existed in the game. Lastly, there were characters I wanted to know more about but outside a couple of \"reports\" I couldn\\'t help myself further. It would have been great if there was more time and backstory for Mr.X, Willian and Ada.\\n\\nI\\'ll give it an 8 because despite my concerns, I had a surprisingly good time with the game.The best resident Evil ever?\\n\\nOn January 25th.Now comes the remake.So I will play it up and down again to see exactly what was changed.So far I have only looked at the trailer at the E3, I will catch up with the rest when the game is there.But now to the original.First of all, I have to say that it has had the best story so far.The characters were and are still great.The game bash at the last minute.Thanks Capcom for this game.I have it for the PS1, PS3, the Dreamcast, the N64 and the GameCube.The PC version is still followed.Soon for the PS4 and the Xbox One.I love the part and I hope you too?Capcom made a great remake. It is the perfect game in this new generation for survival horror lovers. Maybe not really deep from a narrative point of view, but it is soo fun and beautiful.Summary: Ready or not, the terror of Resident Evil 2 is here. In chapter one, the case of the disastrous T-virus outbreak--a mutagenic toxin designed for biological weapons--was eventually closed but the experiments were far from over.

It presented realistic, impressive and frightening characters and survival horror. Everything is very special, even the graphics are better than the first part.… ExpandIt\\'s probably because i was spoiled by the later resident evil games but I just did not enjoy this as much as I would have liked. It\\'s not a bad game nonetheless.It is one of the best psx games.Besides Zero, which was the best one, and 3 , which is my 2nd favorite,2 is definitely great, the puzzles are fun and the characters are good. I really do like this game. I love all the RE games! Except OB.this rating is what i\\'ve played of it. i just got a memory card (i gotta ps2) and so far its pretty impressive. i\\'m on the bit where u have just lowered the emergancy stairgate in the hall. the graphics are good 4 a ps1 game, and if i have given it an 8 and im so little in the game i\\'m sure it\\'ll b a 10 by the end of the game.I totally agree with Jay D because the scenarios in RE2 were way too short and the story line wasnt much cop either. Yes its a great game but RE 1 is by far the best of all resident evils so far (Full Stop).A milestone that made the history of horror video games and medium in general.An engaging and fun adventure that continues to fascinate despite the age.It\\'s hard to express what kind of a water-shedding mile stone and phenomena the original Resident Evil 2 was when it came out back in the 1998. Or rather, it was already a phenomena long before the release; that big think the original Biohazard game had been just couple years prior, and the hype surrounding its bigger and badder sequel was off the scale. While the game eventually got a handful of revisions and design changes before the final version, the game we ultimately got was no short of a masterpiece.\\n\\nI assume everyone\\'s already familiar with the premise of Resident Evil:\\nSomething bizarre has gone terribly wrong in a remote town of Raccoon City, and the streets are now swarmed by undead creatures. The survival-horror gameplay resembles the adventure games of the old quite a bit, revolving around exploration of certain major locations (in a semi non-linear manner), finding key items and supplies, reading notes to piece together the story, and solving puzzles in order to access new areas and challenges. There\\'s a limited inventory space you need to plan and adjust once in a while, and saving is handled in specified safe-rooms, using consumable items you need to hunt down from the world (Ink-ribbons). There are no auto-saves.\\n\\nComing on two discs, one per each of the game\\'s playable characters, Leon and Claire, RE2 expanded and enhanced upon the RE1\\'s two campaigns idea by making both of the character\\'s stories overlap, and even interact. Depending on which of the two you decided to start with, the first character would be placed into an \"A route\", where as continuing the game after the credits with the second disc would show the \"B route\" from the second character\\'s perspective. These routes also have a handful of spots where choices made during A affect things in B, dubbed the \"Zapping system\".\\nThis meant that you got essentially four different versions of the game\\'s campaign, with a couple minor adjustments you could try out on top, greatly enhancing the replay value further. And then you have various unlockables and bonus mini-games as an extra carrot!\\n\\nThe audio-visual presentation is still drop-dead gorgeous and atmospheric, even after all these years. The pre-rendered world of Raccoon city is highly detailed and cleverly presented you via changing cinematic camera-angles, that alone can tell a tale and form a certain mood. The sound-design further helps craft this sad scene of a zombie apocalypse, with the echoing, pitiful moans of the walking corpses being especially haunting. The voice-acting was also a major leap from the original RE\\'s hilarious dialog, further helping to take the story seriously.\\n\\nEven in 2020, I still rate the 1998\\'s classic RE2 above its more recent \"remake\". I was quite saddened by Capcom\\'s decision to cut out so much content, while also apparently appealing to the more casual player base, thus removing or watering down what I\\'d consider essential survival-horror traits (ie. limited saves, no check-points, lack of UI and hints, plenty of replay value...).Great.Terrifying.Electrifying.It is a true survivor horror, this game should be eternalized as a better day!A sequel that surpasses the original game. It is in general a more of the same approach survival horror but bigger and better. The story is set a few weeks after the events Resident Evil 1. The S.T.A.R.S team had returned but no superior believed their story. They were discredited, disbanded and shut down. Meanwhile other events started and spiral into Raccoon City becoming a death zone infested with monstrosities. You chose again between 2 playable characters. There is Claire Redfield who is the sister of Chris Redfield from Resident Evil 1. She visits Raccoon City for find her brother who disappeared without a trace. Then there is Leon S. Kennedy who is a rookie cop and this is his first day. They say the first day in a job is a nightmare but they have not seen what Leon has to endure;-). Depending on which character you chose the game is different. There are difference in the story, weapons, NPCs and exploration. A full playtrough is playing the story for both characters. For clarification: This means there are different routes and 4 playtroughs to see everything. Hope the following example helps: If you start with Claire you get Claire A and then Leon B (Scenario 1). If you started wit Leon you get Leon A and Claire B (Scenario 2). It was a remarkable idea and great experience back then. The story has again great B-movie flair and is quite enjoyable. The feeling of dread is excellent in this game. The side characters work well be it the mysterious Ada Wong, the innocent Sherry or chief of police Brian Irons. Gameplay wise it is solid survival horror Resident Evil style. You have to find an escape while dealing with scare ammunition, solving puzzles and manage a limited inventory space. Again you can only save in save rooms with ink ribbons that are limited and must be found. This mechanic might anger some people but intensifies the experiences. You must make harsh decision like avoiding enemies or use ammunition with the risk of being hurt. The puzzles itself are mostly standard like finding the right item and use it at the right place with a few other riddles. The tank controls are back and became a staple for the series. With tank control it means left and right rotate the characters and do not move them in the direction. You have to rotate and then move. I hate this but accepted it for Resident Evil. Technically the game improved a lot. The graphics were leagues better and the FMV were remarkable for its time. I think I give a few tips here: As by Resident Evil standard mixing herbs works well like for example a red and green one. There is a facility where you can lock in and having 2 user may give the second character that locked in something good. You can reload in the item menu while no time passes outside. Lastly save your stronger weapons or better said the ammunition for bosses or though enemies. Back to the review. Overall this was a great sequel and cemented the status of the Resident Evil franchise. I think it is still worth playing but there is also the excellent remake. May not hold up enough compared to modern standards.Masterpiece of the original PlayStation, lost count of how many times I have completed thisWarning: Spoilers\\n\\'Resident Evil\\' shook the game playing nation when it first arrived in 1996. Such was its popularity that Capcom developed a director\\'s cut version the following year, which also featured a demo for the sequel, \\'Resident Evil 2\\'. In 1998, the sequel appeared in its full glory and, while maybe not as good as the first game, was still a rip-roaring success and yet another golden gaming venture.\\n\\nTwo months after the incident at the mansion in the Arklay Mountains in Raccoon City, the remaining S.T.A.R.S members flee to the Umbrella HQ\\'s in Europe to carry-out investigations of rumours of the creation of the G-Virus ( a far more powerful variation of the T-Virus which caused the zombie outbreak ). Arriving in the zombie infested city that was once Raccoon City are rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy ( who has been newly recruited by the R.P.D ) and Claire Redfield ( who has arrived to track down her brother Chris ). The two ( who are the game\\'s protagonists ) try to seek refuge in the police station, thinking it to be safe, but most of its officers have been eaten by or have become zombies.\\n\\nThe only remaining survivors are Brian Irons, the corrupt Chief Of Police who was receiving bribes from Umbrella to hush up their experimental failures, officer Marvin Branagh who was attacked by zombies and reporter Ben Bertoculli, who has locked himself in a cell to stop himself from being eaten by the zombies. All of whom end up being killed.\\n\\nIf playing Claire, you will meet a young girl named Sherry Birkin, whose mother and father, Annette and William Birkin, who both work for Umbrella and are both responsible for the virus outbreak. If playing Leon you will meet a young woman named Ada Wong, a spy whose boyfriend John formerly worked for Umbrella and who was sent in to obtain data regarding the G-Virus. The trouble starts when when William Birkin injects himself with the G-Virus after spies tried to steal his creation from him. As a result, he became a deadly malformed creature. Your aim is much as before, battle your way through a plethora of dangerous creatures and difficult puzzles and booby traps and make it out alive.\\n\\nLike I said earlier, \\'Resident Evil 2\\' does not have the same shock impact as the first game but all the same is a marvellous game playing experience. Some new monsters are brought in here such as the licker ( a skinless creature with sharp claws and a piercing tongue ), Mr. X ( a variant of Tyrant who only appears in the second half of the game ), an over-sized alligator as well as an over-sized moth. The scripting and voice-acting here is not quite as sloppy as the first game but is still pretty cringe-worthy ( such as the scene in which Leon over-dramatically cries Ada\\'s name when he thinks she has died on him ). There is also a hidden game which can be unlocked entitled \\'The Fourth Survivor\\' which follows Umbrella\\'s attempts to secure the G-Virus sample.\\n\\nThe success of \\'Resident Evil 2\\' also prompted a third game in 1999 entitled \\'Resident Evil 3: Nemesis\\', which had Jill Valentine from the first game as the protagonist. \\'Nemesis\\' in my view was the best of the three games made thus far and in my view would have made a fitting finale to the series however Capcom took it into their heads to devise a fourth game in 2000 entitled \\'Resident Evil: Survivor\\'. Gameplayers yawned.\\n\\nApparently a remake of \\'Resident Evil 2\\' is in the offing, with updated graphics, new voice acting and more puzzles. If it will be as good as the remake of the first game, I cannot wait.As a sequel, Resident Evil 2 is up there as one of the best. It is also one of the best, if not the best, entries in the series. The story and the music are especially powerful.This game is a game perfect !\\nI can\\'t believe that\\'s game was release 1998 !!\\nSound Flawless , graphics good but resident evil 3 best graphics than resident evil 2 because RE3 good revealed raccoon city . but I think Resident evil 2 a revolution at all games . I still enjoying from play RE2\\nThrowing off  Ada  The only scene was that I cried :\\'(loved this game back in 1998,\\nscary graphics\\n, immersive story,\\nhyper gore action,\\nclever puzzle solving\\n, historic event in video games, only detriment,\\nreplay is very limited, given the few gameplay options.\\nstill, alot of funWas not for RE1 Remake it would be the best Survival Horror of all time. storytelling/story and characters evolved a ton from first game, graphics are much better. No downsides for such a awesome game.The story of the wonderful meaning of the word and the way to play For examples of the most beautiful games Resident Evil We have events and scenario of the events of the game Shed fun with time and raise the level of difficulty of the game with time, especially with the headResident Evil 2 is arguably better than the original. If the first game was \"Night of the Living Dead\", than this sequel is \"Dawn of the Dead\". It\\'s everything RE 1 was, but on a much bigger scale. There is more action, more cinematics, two playable characters and four different endings. This is one of the best games in the series. I would give it a 9.3 out of 10.one of my \"gamer sins\" is that i haven\\'t never played RE2. You can even get old Resident Evil games on ps3 from psn store. Now i do understand why everybody says this is one of the best survival horror titles exist. okay graphics and sound are good for -98 title, and story is intriguing. This game introduce us Leon S. Kennedy who is first day on R.P.D and BAM! zombies everywhere, bad luck for him. You see lots of familiar faces in this game if you have played new RE titles. Game can took 8 hours to complete or 10 if you want to get everything from this title, please take your time it\\'s survival horror you know ? games soundtrack is awesome too and throw you middle of the atmosphere. Even thou you think old games are full of cliches you will be surprised how much capcom but in this game. Rumors says that they are making remake from RE2 so maybe check this one out while waiting ?One of the best games I played in my life. The graphics, the feeling of darkness, the gameplay, the story, the characters, the sound section ... One of the gems that nobody can miss if they have a Playstation 1This is a case where the original title lay the foundations for a great game and the second title nailed it right on the head.\\n\\nResident Evil 2 features better controls, better graphics with more detailed textures, much better puzzle design, better everything. Backtracking which slightly crippled the first game is eliminated here and mostly replaced by smarter (not necessarily more difficult) puzzles.\\n\\nResident Evil 2 takes place within the police headquarters in Raccoon City. You play as Leon or Claire and each playable character (as well as different difficulty levels) introduces some changes to the gameplay resulting in a game with great replay value. It is one of the rare games I have played through within almost a 24-hour period, because the gameplay was so tight and no part of it felt like it’s there just to prolong the playtime.\\n\\nI know the remake is great, but you should not skip the original second title if you are into Resident Evil series. I suggest Classic Rebirth version as it’s a comprehensive patch to the PC port, making it at least as good as its best console ports.\\n\\nResident Evil 2 is easily one of the best PlayStation 1 games I have played, both technically and gameplay-wise.The most remarkable is the setting and especially the soundtrack.The story is very good, but it is not entirely row.The puzzles are very easy but the level of difficulty is generally adequate.When I played it as a young man, I am astonished by the immersive of the stages, the interesting thing about the characters and their desolate horror atmosphere, a masterpiece of its kind.\\nMusic, scenarios and amazing characters.A bright game.I\\'ve played RE2 back in 2000 and I couldn\\'t finish it because it was a borrowed game, now that I\\'ve revisited without the nostalgia glasses I can safely say that this game is as classic as it comes, sure the control scheme is very clumsy and at times the dramatic camera angles don\\'t help it at all but, when you get the hang of it, it just makes sense. The environment and the enemies have this amazing horror atmosphere and also I really liked every character. Because of the localization or the acting or even that the story is not that good, at times, it feels a little cliche but it\\'s OK, speaking of characters my least favorite must be Leon, is kinda boring but in the other hand, Ada and Claire are pretty cool. Also if you\\'re into JoJo\\'s Bizarre Adventure expect to encounter a lot of references.\\n\\nOverall is an amazing experience, like having a puzzle that by the end it just builds itself naturally. The rhythm of the game is also incredible I believe I played around 6 hours per character and I wanted more, the way that the 2 stories interact feels way ahead of its time (I believe they wanted to do a similar thing with RE 6). If you\\'re looking for a thrilling experience and you haven\\'t played it yet, please check it out.before Nemesis , resident evil 2 was a great game , i like it i hope Capcom remake Nemesis too.I played again recently, just Claire\\'s album.It is still fun as at the time despite the limitations of that time.A wonderful sequel filled with content and improvements in every aspect from the original. And while I do not hold the same view of this being one of if not the best RE game but do still believe Its a great time to play just not amazing.A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!While it is more complete and has some things arranged from the first game, it still has many of the same problems either the controls, camera or the saving system.The first Evil resident that I have passed and could not have left me better mouth.I loved the way in which we have to administer resources, as you have to use the different objects, the puzzles and above all the exploration has amazed me reminding me of a metroidvania.One of the best games ever made!!! Claire and Leon are also one of the best characters in the series!!! Amazing Story, Very Good Tank Gameplay... No Doubt the best RE game of the Classic.Leon and Claire quickly became my two favorite characters in the series. And even now, they still remain my top two.\\nLeon: The rookie. With more skill than the well ventured officers. And Claire, the attractive, energetic girl, both taking the top spot of the series.\\nI loved that this game had two different campaigns, both leading back to one another. You get to see what both characters were up to, while returning back to one another.\\nThe puzzles were good, but I felt like they got a little drawn out towards the end of the game. Yet I still really enjoyed the game.A solid horror game with great level design and good combat. Not particularly tense, scary or atmospheric.',\n",
       " 'i think its okay , this is how we do it , the atmosphere in this game (its very scary) you can give it a try ,show must go onGood-\\nA captivating and well-told story. Constant tension and incredible atmosphere. It feels genuinely scary and unnerving. The exploration and puzzles are engaging for the most part. It looks and sounds great\\n\\nBad-\\nThe puzzles are a bit obtuse at points. The camera sway that happens when you move around is a bit excessive. There is some technical issues like crashing and frame dips.\\n\\nThoughts-\\nEven with the few issues it does have though, MADiSON is a great game. 2014’s P.T. was a watershed moment for survival horror games, and in the years since then, we’ve had countless games that have tried to replicate its first person psychological horror mastery. Not many have succeeded, but MADiSON surely comes closer than most. It has a great understanding of the key tenets of any good horror experience – pacing, atmosphere, tension, knowing when to be restrained and when to let loose – which more than makes up for some of its more frustrating gameplay and technical issues. If you’re a fan of psychological horror, or of horror in general, this is a game that you definitely need to check out.As a fan of these types of games, I\\'d give it a solid 9. It is the scariest game I\\'ve played since Visage, but it has a longer story, varied settings, and some great puzzles. So I\\'d say if you\\'re like me and you love turning out all the lights, putting on the headphones and letting the atmosphere and dread take over, you definitely want to play this game.\\n\\nSome of the puzzles had me head scratching, but only for a short time- there was always a solution that made me think \"of course! how did I not get it sooner?\" Personally, I don\\'t want puzzles that are easy. I want to feel some small accomplishment when I come to the solution. And in a game like this, with the amazing sound design keeping you on edge, it adds to the dread when you have to backtrack through dark halls or explore around a room.\\n\\nThe only negative for me is simply that I felt like the creativity could have gone further, and weirder, in terms of the horror and the \"monsters\". I think of a game like Inside or The Forest, or even the godfather P.T., where the game takes turns that just wow the player, and I feel like there could have been some more of that. The familiar horror tropes were all here, albeit done very well. This game felt like Visage 2- a bigger, improved sequal. After a game like Martha Is Dead, I was a little disappointed at how quickly I raced through it, with very little scares. Cautiously optimistic going into Madison, it exceded my expectations.\\n\\nSo I\\'m giving this a solid 9- if you like the P.T. style games, this is arguably the best we\\'ve got right now.Best horror experience in my whole life. Keep this path mates. Cheers guys!I loved the game.A great horror experience with all the letters !!!Literally the most terrifying experience I had in my entire life.\\nWe need more games like this oneBest horror experience mate. Thanks for this terrifying horror game. i streamed last nightThe best horror experience I had in years. Too bad it came out with lot of bugsIt\\'s a very short game. No replayability.\\nVery boring common walking sim.\\nLOUD = SCARY is tired.\\nand Too many bugs.\\nDon\\'t waste your money.\\n\\nAs you can see from the reviewer name, its a rigged score.',\n",
       " 'Nothing extremely special, but these days, hardly anything is anyway. Still better than most AAA games of 2022, so there\\'s that.Beautiful and fun game from same studio, that made The Evil Within. They know exactly how to make mysterious and unique atmosphere. Unlike The Evil Within, it\\'s not horror game, it\\'s more action-adventure, but it definitely has some horror elements here and there. Very cool creature and boss designs, just as in The Evil Within, very creative. I haven\\'t finished it yet, but after 7 hours of gameplay i can easily recommend it, if you are looking for something unique to play.Overall good game, not perfect tho. Some audio issues, but haven\\'t notice any bugs, so that\\'s good. Would recommend, if you have nothing else to play.If anyone was expecting horror.....well it\\'s not horror. BUT there\\'s still enough creepy moments and i think what this game really does well is atmosphere and overall vibe of Tokyo. Perfect city for this type of game.A very interesting and captivating concept let down by a mediocre open world, gameplay and story. This has been the most forgettable and average game I\\'ve played in the past decade or so,  The story while possibly being the best part of the experience which is not saying much is shallow and very bland the characters while at first seem to have some potential ultimately feel rushed and flat. The gameplay while not bad is super simplistic and just like the rest of the game shallow, the combat system had a lot of potential with the different elements but ultimately they\\'re all just different coloured guns that don\\'t have much of a difference from each other past the initial spell. The world is the worst offender with empty meaningless spaces and boring navigation with not much happening in between. I was hoping for a Prey like experience where the world is empty but has a lot of interesting environmental story telling but it can\\'t even achieve that, with boring texts that pretty much say the same thing just worded differently and the movement and parkour being jankier than Morrowind from 2001. Overall not a terrible game but a very very forgettable one which I have no intention of returning to.Nothing special, boring story, boring gameplay. Visual design and the atmosphere of the world are good and interesting.Tango Gameworks is amazing studio. Almost everything they do is great. Wasn\\'t huge fan of The Evil Within 2, but The Evil Within 1 was near masterpiece. Ghostwire: Tokyo is also good.One of the best games in 2022 so far.\\n\\nAfter 12h roaming around Tokyo, I really enjoy this game. The graphic & visual are amazing even without ray tracing. Besides of main mission, there are a lot of things to do. The player is free to move around, climb, parkour through any obstacles. Moreover, the combat is primarily the funniest part with beautiful hand gestures.\\n\\nBtw, there\\'s some imperfection.\\n- The main story is kinda boring. As well as side missions, they are quite repetitive. The enemies like yokai, monsters are not abundance that you always face the same group of enemies.\\n- There are many activities around the map & side missions but some are too short, some are monotonous.\\n- Lacking character\\'s skins, clothes.\\n- I wish the combat is more varied. I need more combos, super moves.\\n\\nIn short, the game is pretty fun and enjoyable.This game is fun and fresh, and at the same time kind of one note and repetitive. Graphics and character animations are below the standard I would expect from a game in 2022, but still highly enjoyable. Combat is fun, and challenging at times. Music and atmosphere is great, and all the Japanese cultural content is always a bonus.Very unique, this game needs a sequel ASAP and The Evil Within 3 would be also amazing.Very good game, atmosphere is superb, but it\\'s obviously not for everyone and i think that\\'s also a positive. Not every game needs to be extremely mainstream.Very good game, way better than Elden Ring. It\\'s obviously not as overhyped as Elden Ring, despite that, i hope it sells well enough, so it gets some DLC\\'s.As of right now, this game is easy GOTY! First time in 2022 i felt like i\\'m actually playing modern video game. Actually playing something NEW. Elden Ring feels like game from 2014, Horizon Forbidden West feels like game from 2018, Dying Light 2 could have come out in 2015 and it wouldn\\'t make a difference. Ghostwire: Tokyo is simply something else. Story, city design, graphics, sound, monster design - ALL of it feels actually fresh and not re-using same combat from 6 years ago like some other games do. As of right now, this is best game of 2022.Hell yeah, AlanWake2, I agree with you my dude. This game is stylish to a T. I love how they were able to make Tokyo feel so alive despite there only being spirits and pets. It\\'s super cool how the street lights turn red (with lens flare) when the ghosts detect you. 9/10 just cause depth dips in later game, but love the potential for this gameplay style--not to mention the universe. And, you always gotta give kudos to new IP!i accidentally seen a review before the release, and this said that the game was something like \"tr4ash\" to sum it  up. Then i tried it and i can say that its quite the opposite. Beautiful graphics, simple gameplay but its effective and addictive, Japan looks amazing in it, very nice game.A great game that the under-journalists have fired.Take boldly and play, there is no anniversary here.Ghostwire:Tokyo is the next masterpiece of Shinji Mikami and his crew.\\n\\nAs the title mentions, the story sets in Tokyo/Shibuya, a famous district which is well known for his crossroad. The protagonist is a man who wanted to see his sister in a hospital. He got into an accident. Short after, the disaster is going to start. A supernatural power appears and takes control of the main character. And from there on, you got to fight your way through the enemies who stand in your way. The sister seems to have an important meaning for the enemy and takes her away. The main mission will be to save the sister and to put the horror to an end.\\n\\nThe genre can be categorized into the mystery-psycho-horror. The japanese culture takes an essential part as well so that Ghostwire:Tokyo develops a spiritual content.\\n\\nLike always, the character possesses a skill tree in which the abilities can be learned. The character is capable of using powers of the elements wind, fire and water. Talisman, bow and a katana belongs to the arsenal as well. With this equipment it will be possible to attack in different ways whereas the environment can be used to neutralize the enemy.\\n\\nThe enemy itself is some sort of a ghost nearly without a face. It gets quite serious if more than five enemies come towards to attack. At this point it is important to develop tactics and strategies to beat the ghosts.\\n\\nThe environment seems to be a perfect image to the real Shibuya. Despite the enemies, there are cats and dogs which are not hit by the catastrophe. You can talk to them, give them food and in return they bring you to statues. In front of these statues you can pray in order to increase your ammo-capacity for the element attacks. There are even stores that are run by cats named yokai. You can make business with them like buying food and clothes and selling certain items. Ghostwire offers many connections to the japanese spiritual understanding and beliefs.\\n\\nThe way of fighting is so refreshing and deeply something else. This proves that it is not really necessary to have a gun and rifle to create a great experience.\\n\\nThere are sidequests as well. These quests give always a different storyline and each one is individual. It is really worth to take a look at it. The sidequests give the opportunity to enter houses, buildings etc.. There are also lost souls that needs to be saved. After you have found them, you have to go to a telephone and bring them back to their bodies.\\n\\nFazit:\\n\\nGhostwire:Tokyo effectively uses the Unreal Engine whereas the way of fighting is very refreshing. Walking through Shibuya is also something that is quite rare. This makes the adventure more exciting. The connection to the japanese culture gives Ghostwire:Tokyo a more deeply and serious tone.\\n\\n10/10Unfortunately this has mostly been a huge waste of time. The game sadly doesn\\'t have any good aspects except the game play (which gets incredibly repetitive due to the enemy and environment design after 2 hours) and the city (which looks beautiful but samey after awhile). The story is really bare bones and it feels like it has been stretched out. The game and its boring as hell fetch quests also make this more of a chore to play rather than anything entertaining. I enjoyed the music and the voice acting was also done very well but sadly this game should have been way shorter and they should\\'ve focused more on fleshing out the story and game play mechanics rather than making an empty, repetitive open world with nothing new to add to the mix.7,1/10\\nConceptually unusual shooter, surprisingly released at about the same time as Shadow Warrior 3, it also an \"asian culture\" shooter aimed at western audience, with a commentator in the form of a spirit-helper, though the ghost is not charismatic at all, there is even a kind of grappling hook.\\nBut here we have a story-driven shooter, the plot itself is very banal, the villain kidnaps our sister from the hospital and we have to rescue her, along the way freeing dozens of souls in an empty city (although not quite, instead of people cats and dogs walking here). The cutscenes are also poorly done, so this is clearly not an aspect of the game for which you need to play it.\\nAll these abilities out of our hands..of course, the idea is cool, but there is a very small roster of moves, for the first hours you will generally walk with literally one ability - a finger shot, fights are very boring, similar to a \"clicker\", and the awesome looking ability to let out from hand yellow wires from the trailer, used only for finishings (pulling souls). Next tricks are some kind of fireballs, water waves, green bombs.. in general, banality, it’s not interesting to shoot them. The mechanics also seem to be nothing really original, here, for example, there are the same banal \"red barrels\" from any shooter, only in the form of red balls.\\nThat is, the game is missed it`s big potential, it disappointed me, it would be cool if Marvel made a game like this about Doctor Strange, by the way)\\nBut then there is a beautiful city, good graphics, though only the first levels are optimized, then the FPS drops by 2-3 times, and, in cutscenes, there is just a black screens (which, by the way, is a huge technical fail for a story game)\\nAlso, the city here is a large open corridor location, with gradually opening zones, and this greatly hinders its exploration, especially at first, because the fog in the city often does not allow you to move away from the story path just a couple of meters.\\nWell, you can also probably find some small elements of horror here or study Japanese culture in a local store by reading descriptions of a bunch of edibles with the same parameters that act as a first-aid kits here.\\n\\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page:\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/\\n\\n/\\nНа русском: https://www.backloggd.com/u/grihajedy/review/348917/For a $60 asking price -> This is not worth $60, at all.\\nYou can run through the game in about 5-6 hours.\\nThe game is very simple, combat is simple, most gameplay consists of defeating the same enemy and picking up collectables. That\\'s it.\\nFor a full priced AAA game, this is not it! This is like a Ubisoft game with map makers and collectables and boring game in general.\\nStory is fine\\nGraphics are fine\\nEverything else is mediocre or worse.\\n\\nIf they just have asked $30 or $40, it would have made sense.Ghost Boring Tokyo\\n\\nI like TEW franchise so I expected good game, but in fact I even regret about playing this game and see good concept with raw mechanics.\\n\\nVisual (6/10) Graphic is average, but it\\'s not AAA, so I can say even good. Tokyo, ghost designs are really interesting and great, but after 4 hours your eyes are really tired of the same streets, subways, buildings and ghosts. I feel I returned back in 2010th with nearly open world games like prototype, true crime and saints raw. You can see all designers gaps and how they masked same levels and buildings and it brakes the whole atmosphere at least for me. Music another thing that I totally don\\'t like in this game. Music doesn\\'t work at all in this game, forget that music can scare you, or encourage for dynamic battles. You have near 10 trial melodies that repeats whole game. I think if they would add internet radio it would be much better.\\n\\nGameplay(5/10) Mechanics - simply this game is pure shooter. You have universal rifle(Green/wind spells), shotgun(Water/blue spells) for group of enemies or enemies with shields and rocketgun(Orange/fire spells) for bosses and mini bosses and for fun a bit. That\\'s all folks. You will run through the city and kill enemies just to farm upgrades for your weapons. And all upgrades are.... just stats or passive things. That\\'s why I regret that I even play this game it\\'s god damn antic shooter with all bad mechanics that you can imagine. Bosses are very straightforward, enemy types are also bad - melee, melee sprinter, rifler, tanks, healers, some flying enemies and that\\'s all. For game that should be at least near 8-10 hours(main story just 4 hours). Another stupid thing is greending extra activities. Yeah sometimes you can find interesting legend but in 90% cases you will enter arena and need to kill all enemies. You can hook up onto the building but just only to get some souls from 250k to complete quest... I am confused why not make good linear game without all this unnecessary stuff to prolong game. Only good point that at list this raw mechanics works without significant bugs. I hardly imagine why this game has so many positive reviews. The only answer I have game industry is badly injured by big empty not working titles, so people are glad to play something that at least works.\\n\\nStory(3/10) No story here. You are random guy who have some powers and... at the end of the game you are the same guy. Really no story. I thought it would be at least interesting to understand who is the bad guy but plot in hentai written more professionally than here. Characters - two main characters, that almost don\\'t have anything to say each other. Who is KK I don\\'t know - cop? yakudza? manga writer? it doesn\\'t matter because still no story. I\\'ve add one point here only because I found some interesting extra story that explains some Japaneze legends. And I really like that here you can see mix of different city legends and traditional believes.\\n\\nAll in all if you like Tokyo and want 3D tour you can play the game. If you like pets - just go get one and chill. If you like city legend - I think it\\'s better to go on book forum and read some books than playing this game. It\\'s bad game, but good demo for future, maybe. Because I like setting of the game, but not the game itself.Beautiful game, especially if you are interested in Japanese culture.You learn a lot from it if you are willing to read the game of the game and the representation of Shibuya is perfect.It is visually at another level and PC optimization is very good, allowing you to play in the highest and raytracing configurations even if you have a mid -range GPU.Gameplay is not the most worked in the world but it is equally fun.A game to play 100% chill and take the time to explore it thoroughlyA game that in the first trailer didn\\'t seem to be much, over time and gameplay trailers was making it more curious and hypada.Very good to see that master Shinji Mikami does not lose his hand in creativity.For those who like culture and Japanese legends this game is a must -see show.Sidequests are a show apart, varied and not tiring (do not follow the Ubisoft Standard of filling sausage).\\nTechnically better than Elden Ring (which I also loved), did not receive the same \"affection\" of the media \"specialized\" because it is from a Studio from Bethesda ...\\nThose who judge a game only for its origin (see unfounded red notes) will lose a huge game, unlike a lot of things out there ...This is without a doubt the most disappointing game I\\'ve played this year. First off, I went into this game with the perfect mindset. I wasn\\'t expecting some Elden Ring style open world and I also wasn\\'t expecting it to be particularly scary. I came in thinking that it would at least be a fun action game to kill time. What I didn\\'t know is that this game makes Ubisoft games look good. I would rather play AC Valhalla than this and I\\'d rather play all the Evil Within 10 times than to 100% this game. I played this game for 11 hours and can\\'t help but quit. I have played much longer games and had way more fun than this, I stopped playing AC Valhalla at hour 20 because I was feeling the repetition while this game takes it to a whole other level. There is so much wrong in this game that I can\\'t understand how someone could give this anything above a 5. There is not a single pinch of love put into this game that I can feel. It feels like the only person that really wanted to make the game was Ikumi Nakamura (the ex creative director of the game) and when she left, the other devs were forced to finish this game which created this cesspool of a video game.\\n\\nCOMBAT & PROGRESSION\\nWhen I saw the combat through the gameplay trailers, I was excited. It looks great and the animations are badass then I saw the amount of elements and I was like \"Wow, can\\'t wait to see what other badass attacks I can throw at my enemies\". WHAT I DIDN\\'T EXPECT was the fact that there are only 3 ELEMENTS and each of them only has 2 attacks, light and heavy. THAT IS IT. For a 16 hour game, this is pathetic. The skill tree is a joke. Even with there being only 3 elements, I was still somewhat optimistic. At the 5 hour mark, I was grinding to get skill points and maybe unlock something that would be cool. Maybe you can throw tornadoes with the air element or something, but no. The upgrades are boring and dreadful. \"Increase the width of your water element attack from 1m to 2m\" WOW so fun. There\\'s also nothing for the melee department. There isn\\'t anything like summoning a fire sword that you can use against enemies. This is creatively bankrupt and it shocks me that the man who made this studio was Shinji Mikami. It is embarrassing that his name is now put into this game.\\nThe combat also doesn\\'t improve with the poor array of enemy types. The enemies have cool designs even tho most of them look identical. The way their attacks are choreographed are all quite different. The flaw here is that 95% of enemies require the same way to kill which is by spamming everything you have at it. Only one enemy that actually forced me to change elements and that is the fat shield guys because you gotta use the water elements since it\\'s like shotgun. There isn\\'t any dynamic weapon switches like in Doom Eternal where you constantly change weapons depending on the enemies. This just makes combat way more bland than it already is. It also doesn\\'t help that in the 8 hour mark, it had already gotten stale which is insanely quick.\\n\\nOPEN WORLD & ACTIVITIES\\nThis world is the definition of empty. The map screen is so cluttered with **** There are telephone booths everywhere in this game, why did the developers have the need to place all of them on the map screen? Same goes for the flying dudes. They felt like they need to show everything on the map, no matter how badly it effects the experience as a whole. The worst aspects of this open world is definitely collecting spirits. There are a total of 240 000 spirits you need to collect. How do you collect spirits you may ask? Well, you hold the right mouse button. You do this for every single spirit you find, HOW IS THIS FUN!!!.\\nAnd then there\\'s the side quest which I gave them a chance. I tried to be compelled but Christ almighty this is worse than Death Stranding. In this game, you talk to random souls that all have the exact same design. There is absolutely no way for anyone to be interested in whatever is happening to these people. It got so bad that I just skipped every single side quest and just look for the rewards it gave me\\n95% of buildings in this game you cannot enter and when there are, it is stopped by a loading screen and you\\'re teleported into the building. What year is this? Am I back in 2012? Even Yakuza Kiwami fixed this problem long ago. What a joke.\\n\\nSTORY\\nThe most generic anime plot to ever exist. Blank protagonist who cares for his blank of a sister who is working with a blank detective to save Tokyo from a blank villain. That\\'s the best way I can put this story. The acting is also weak, the amount of overacting in this one is hilarious and no scene will even touch your emotions.\\n\\nWith all the problems that exist in this game, I\\'m starting to think that it\\'s quite generous that I gave this game a 3. But I hope Tango games learn from this. I think they should stop making open world games and just stick to what they\\'re good at since The Evil Within was great.Good Game! Good Game! Good Game! Good Game! Good Game! Good Game! Good Game!Game is fun and has up-to-date graphics (almost cringe that i have to mention that as a +, thank you Elden Ring for your 2012 graphics i guess). As of right now, i would strongly advise ignoring negative reviews, because there\\'s right now two groups of gamers who are angry that their favorite game didn\\'t get enough attention. One is Elden Ring Cult members who are angry that most people don\\'t want to die billion times in video game and other group is Horizon Forbidden West fanboys who think that people should like games with mediocre writing. Ghostwire: Tokyo is better than both of them, but you will find lots of people right now, who swear that only their favorite game is THE best and everything else is trash. Just ignore these people.Great gaame ,i absolutely love it!So much fun ,the fights are great!it\\'s a must haveJapanese Folklore Greatness.\\n\\nGhostwire Tokyo is quite a new fresh IP from Tango Gameworks, quite different from their previous series, The Evil Within games, which I really like a lot, both of them.\\n\\nTango has moved away from pure Survival Horror to a more Action oriented / Paranormal Thriller type of experience and this is fine, because it is a new IP after all, I am happy seeing studios trying new things, which does not invalidate their previous work (I’d still love to see more in the Evil Within series though, of course).\\n\\nThe PC version of Ghostwire Tokyo looks really amazing, it is a game that supports Ray Traced Reflections and Shadows, and particularly the Reflections are some of the best I’ve seen so far in a PC game, only a bit below games like CP 2077 or Control, since in Ghostwire there aren’t RT Reflections for stuff like transparent assets (windows from cars or stuff like that).\\nIn any case, for the rest of the reflections, they do look amazing and very detailed, and they fit the atmosphere of the game pretty well, being a game set in Shibuya, with a lot of rain and wet surfaces.\\n\\nPerformance on PC is also quite excellent for a game that looks like this, the game can easily full over 100 FPS with Raytracing disabled at 1080p and 1440p DLDSR on my Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti, with all the normal settings maxed, and the fact that we can use DLSS only enhances the experience even further.\\nWith Raytracing enabled, I can keep my game above 60 to 70 FPS at 1440p DLDSR and Balanced DLSS, which is not bad at all.\\n\\nThere’s one issue, currently in the game, that affects VRAM usage, regarding the Streaming Texture Quality setting: if set to high values such as Cinematic or High, the performance can suddenly degrade, permanently, until either restarting the game or switching that Texture Streaming setting to “Auto”. This fixes the performance degradation for me, and haven’t experienced this issue ever again.\\nThe game also suffers a bit from Shader Cache issues, so once in a while a small stutter will occur, when a new asset appears, although it did not bother me too much, compared to other recent games like Elden Ring, where it happens more frequently.\\n\\nMoving on to Gameplay: I had a lot of fun with the Combat in this game, and the World Traversal is also quite enjoyable, once we unlock certain skills; think Dishonored series, something similar to that, even better maybe, since we can glide around for a really long time when fully upgraded.\\n\\nCombat…for me was fun, and diverse enough; I’ve read some reviews and opinions claiming they did find the combat boring and repetitive, then only to tell us that they barely used any tools, like “just used the Wind based attacks, that’s all”...well, of course, that’s the issue: Wind is used as the standard spammable attack, long range too, Fire is the big hard hitting skill, with great AoE, for the bigger Visitors / threats, and Water is medium to close range, meant to Cut Through enemies defenses (like umbrellas).\\nThen we have Talismans, which can add a lot of Crowd Control to the combat, useful quite often, or to speed up the Core Extraction process.\\n\\nThe game Controls pretty well with Keyboard and Mouse but, sadly, the Gamepad default settings are a bit of a mess when it comes to Acceleration / Deceleration, makes no sense they included this. I tried my DualSense and it works fine except for that, but I prefer first person games with M&KB, anyway.\\nIt lacks FOV adjustment though, so I hope they patch it in soon, default FOV feels like 90 Hor, not terrible, but far from ideal for 16:9 at least.\\n\\nOne of the best aspects in the game, though, is the Lore / Folklore of Yokais, it was quite a treat being able to read about all of this in the Database section so, if you’re into this kind of stuff, take the time to enjoy the entries, they’re pretty accurate with the actual folklore, and quite detailed in their descriptions.\\n\\nAnimations are really top notch, especially for the ethereal weaving, it\\'s obvious they put in a lot of effort into making these look really smooth and fluid.\\n\\nThe weakest part in this game, in my opinion is the Story and the Characters: while the main duo cast of Akito and KK are great together, the other characters felt not too fleshed out, and it seemed like the game lacked a couple chapters here and there to expand on some of this.\\n\\nI understood pretty well the message this story was trying to convey, it’s a simple message, but a much needed one nowadays, with all that’s going on in the world, but this game feels like it quite suffered the hardships of the pandemic, it’s obvious.\\n\\nAll in all…a decent experience, but it could’ve been better with a little bit more here and there, especially on the Story. The game feels fresh, and if you know Tokyo/Shibuya a lot, you’ll see how well it’s been recreated, that is quite nice to see.A very nice game to play. Nothing too complicated, but with a lot of content. Despite being relatively short, the side quests are cool and bring a lot of interesting content from Japanese history. The gameplay is simple, but enough to have fun. It\\'s definitely worth checking out.Ghostwire Tokyo is one of The first RPG´s that really got me the Feeling to be completeley immersed to the World and the Charackters, sadly you have to Play the game with the highest settings to get an really immersive experience, wich the most peapole arent getting. The Genre mix Feels Refreshing and the gameplay is fluid and a average story.\\n\\nThe Story is not best thing youve ever seen. Its like the basic Isekai (in to another world) Animes, nothing really speacial. Eventhough the Story isnt this advanced the dialougs are. Many diffrent conversations and you can feel trough Akito and his Buddy are more and more friendly to each other.\\n\\nGameplay is decent as I said before right Timings and Thinking what u gonna do next are important on higher diff. level, what I really recommend becuz on the normal diff. there is no real challange to game and Grind does feel like something you dont wanna do.\\nGrinding is actually a big thing in the game and what I wanna tell you is: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HATE GRIND. Even if you are the biggest Japan Fan and Watching Animes the whole Day, if you doesnt like grinding how its pretty usual in Japanese games you wont like this game and will end after the second chapter.\\n\\nOverall Ghostwire Tokyo is a pretty good game there are thing to Improve:\\n\\nEnemey AI\\n\\nVariety of enemeys over the period of the game\\n\\nNo complete gamechanging fighting mechanics\\n\\nToo Grindy for Many Peapole\\n\\nand your Spells doesent have reflections wich is a big deal because water is everywhere here.\\n\\nSo is the Game a Cop or Drop?\\nDefenetly a Cop if you ok with grinding and like Japan or wanna be Mind blowed away from these Graphics. (or troll your firends with youre in Japan with the compressions its like a real photo)\\n\\nDefenetly a Drop if youre a Tik Tok user with a 2 sec attention span, if you have a bad pc (no front), if you want a good story, if you not a grinder and want to have extreme challenging fights.\\n\\nHope you can decide if its Cop or u are a Flop.How could Shinji Mikami be involved  in thus game,  this world, this story@!! This game is so bland, it vanilla icecream the game,it\\'s white paint, nothing stands out, nothing excites the player to entice a sale...This is why sex apoeal use to be mixed with horror. The mix of the good with the bad drew you in , hot woman and gore , sex and violence,  it peaks interest...This game has 2 of the most generic looking Asian guys as characters,  a pretty environment and a bunch of genericly creepy monsters,. But no sexy lead, no Heather, no sexy nurse creatures , no 7 foot vampire woman with her sexy witch daughters no fit wife that chops you hand off, or slim wierdo southern teen.. Horror games devs use to get  how to do horror but now with every game being  made for the Anita Sarkesians of the world every game is dull and Vanilla.There are tech demos more entertaining than this. Yes, the game introduces a slightly new kind of combat, but that\\'s it, the overall gameplay design is simply boring. And by the way, the visuals are not that good.Good:\\nInnovative gameplay, good city modeling.\\n\\nBad:\\nTasks are too instructive, making people feel like they are doing tasks, not traveling.\\n\\nI think this is game version of NARUTO + Tokyo Ghoul, because the story and actor is very similar to Tokyo Ghoul and water looks like rasengan(螺旋丸), fire seems like Goukakyuu no Jutsu(豪火球の術).the game was so boring    . .    .This game is my 2022 GOTY. It is immersive and we need more games like this set in Japan. I\\'d love to go to Kyoto, Okinawa, and Osaka to name a few. I cannot wait to see how they approve upon this title as a series in the future.Bought because of sting. But apart from the setting, there is nothing good in this game. Boring story and gameplay. I do not recommend.only weebs and fanboys will like this trash the worst combat i have ever played in ant gameAlthough the gameplay can get repetitive (especially if you go fot all the side quests), it is original and ful and different, which makes it extremely adictive and enjoyable. The story, setting and visuasl are amazing, and the characters are higly likeable, especially the protagonist two, which you really get to feel close. Some of the side content is boring, but there are a few quests that are really worth and shouln´t be missed out. Overall, a great experience and something new creative in this age.Nice graphic, looks very cool and mystic, but game is SO boring, gameplay tastes like s**t.Not an interesting game, passing takes 5 hours and this is too little.I expected more.Everyone disappointed that the player in the mask of Hanya was not the mainIf you are curious about this game I highly recommend checking it out.\\n\\nThis game is 3 parts story driven walking simulator and 1 part action game.\\nThe level of depth this game dives into the lore, mythos, and culture of Japan is absolutely amazing.\\nCombat in this game is pretty interesting but remains largely the same throughout the whole experience so your mileage may vary. I personally had a great time in the combat system all the way through the final boss.\\nThis game just oozes creativity, story, action and engaging content.\\nUnreal engine 4 is great here and the options to tweak to your PCs limits are quite nice including resolution scaling with TSR. FSR and DLSS.\\n\\nAs far as cons: To me there are a few side quests that felt unnecessary and the skill tree could have been a little more engaging.Ghostwire:Tokyo is the next masterpiece of Shinji Mikami and his crew.\\n\\nAs the title mentions, the story sets in Tokyo/Shibuya, a famous district which is well known for his crossroad. The protagonist is a man who wanted to see his sister in a hospital. He got into an accident. Short after, the disaster is going to start. A supernatural power appears and takes control of the main character. And from there on, you got to fight your way through the enemies who stand in your way. The sister seems to have an important meaning for the enemy and takes her away. The main mission will be to save the sister and to put the horror to an end.It\\'s like an indie game with a good Tokyo city. They managed to make a really bad game with ordinary action sequences and a boring story.The gameplay is fun as heck and just different enough to feel fresh, exciting, and force you to think a little differently than you\\'re used to as a gamer. I finished it for the gameplay alone.\\n\\nBut the story is a joke. A random guy is literally possessed by the plot, and this guy\\'s sister just so happens to be the person the big bad randomly chose to carry out his big evil plan. That\\'s it. That\\'s the premise. But we\\'re supposed to feel emotional about death, grief, and loss at the end? About these random characters with no effort put into them at all? We\\'re supposed to feel connected to this world that looks fascinating but isn\\'t explained AT ALL? A characters busts out abilities to do crazy things and you\\'re like \"well with zero information okay I guess they can do that now.\" That\\'s not even a soft magic system, that\\'s NO magic system.\\n\\nI\\'m not surprised that this is by the Evil Within people, considering this game so clearly answers the question \"what if the Evil Within people tried to do Death Stranding?\" Pretty sure Evil Within never bothered with anything resembling worldbuilding either, if I remember correctly.\\n\\nOh, and it\\'s not even the horror game the announcement trailer promised. I\\'d be super curious to find out where the production of this game went so horribly wrong.Play this on hard. The boss battles were too easy and not frequent enough until the end. Then it turned into a walking simulator. The ending really let down what was otherwise a good gameGhostwire: Tokyo\\nSpoooooookyyy\\nGhostwire Tokyo is an 8 hour plus long first person action game where you play as akito whos been taken over by a spirit after you die.. this spirit offers to help you find your sister if you help him take down this demon… you agree, merge, and now you have these super natural powers…\\nEveryone in Tokyo is dead, there are spirits around this open world that you free by completing optional side activities that also help level you up much quicker in the game… and crawling around this empty city are these creepy demon enemies that you have to blast with your supernatural powers and pull their cores out with your bear hands or with some sort of……. Ghostwire.. .if you stick to the main campaign theres nothing special here… infact the game would be pretty mediocre if you don’t expore its world.. thankfully youll want to… clearing these corrupted trees in your way, clensing these gates to unlock fast ravel points and clear fog to open up the world more… doing some great and also some rigiuclous sidequests which can really immerse you into this world… these are the best moments of ghostwire Tokyo.. immersing yourself into the side activities.. its just a shame youll so quickly grow tired of this world, youll get used to the spooky monsters, the sidequests will start to feel unnecessary.. the skill tree leaves a lot to be desired so youll stop caring about rescuing souls once you’ve unlocked every ability you care about… so youll probably find yourself like me abou halfway through the game jut sticking to the main quests.. which are good.. but nothing to blow you away…  ghostwir Tokyo is fun through.. the combat is tense, youll be juggling through abilities, sneaking up behind enemies trying not to alarm the others… I loved my time spent in this creepy world… my only gripe with conmbat though is this skin crawling nails on chalkboard feeling when you run out of one of the 3 energies and have to switch to another.. I hate it and wish the game would just switch to the next automatically when youre out of one of them… as you do have to destroy glowing items in the environment to refill ammo or pull the cores out of enemies…\\nOverall this is a decently enjoyable action horror game, its unique.. its memorable…\\nWorth hopping into even if it slowly goes from wow this game is amazing to.. that game was pretty good..\\nI give Ghostwire Tokyo\\na 7.5/10The localization =\"Ownership is a crime.\", yep you are right, that is why i pirated itGhostwire: Tokyo possesses beautiful graphics, visual effects and map design that is sadly experienced in a horrible story, eye-rollingly cringe acting, repetitive gameplay, tedious open world activities and uneventful questlines.Overall, it is a good game, but kind of repetitive. It is entertaining for a while, but not a game to enjoy doing 100%.It\\'s your call but for now it\\'s not recommended.\\n1/10 this game at that stage.Non spoilers!\\n\\nNice game, immersive, Tatari difficult is the best, but also repetitive and dont like the history...\\n\\nStill better than the other 2022 ****Lot of collectibles: the game help at the shrines were useful though, good side content, short length.… ExpandAnd a good game full of japan legends and the city and very well made and beautiful even with a little strong pc\\n\\nI recommendIf you like mysticism, Japanese culture, dynamic gameplay, cats and mysterious villain in a mask - this is what you need!\\n\\nI passively waited for this game as a rim in March, because after a gameplay trailer, the game seemed to me with a plastic dummy. But in the end it is very cool. The game is filled with mysticism and the afterlife, in a sense, it resembles Death Stranding. I would say that if you knit these two universes, you get a good crossover.\\n\\nGhostwire Tokyo fascinates with its atmosphere and mysticism. I would not call the gameplay some super interesting, but I have fun to play. Animals wander through the streets, in which you can read thoughts and sometimes their thoughts are very funny. Especially funny cats. There is humor and very good.\\n\\nIn such games, a villain can say, the face of the game. Personally, I like mysterious pathos villains in masks, the personality of which has yet to solve. I am a pointed from Higgs in DS. In this game, the villain has a motive and goal, which makes him interesting and rejoice at every meeting.\\n\\nOf the weaknesses, this is perhaps graphics and optimization. It does not go on high settings at all, although the iron corresponds. The picture in the game, even on high slightly soap, plus you can not turn off the granularity. But in general it looks beautiful, but as if the protagonist forgot points at home.youphoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooA few years ago he traveled to Tokyo and thanks to this game he aroused so many memories as if he had returned there again.The incredible work of the developers is so thoroughly convey the atmosphere of this beautiful city.Me like game but it won\\'t let me release my energy using a trackpad more like tracksad.\\n-edit: door has been fingernblastedYou may find the most enjoyment in this game if the concept is interesting to you; explore a city where humanity has vanished, while experiencing some of Japan\\'s interesting culture and folklore. The gameplay is perfectly fine, but isn\\'t anything special, and fortunately the game is fully aware of this. I don\\'t think this is a game that absolutely everyone will love, but it\\'s an enjoyable time for someone like me that just loves to explore.My Score:\\n\\n(7) - Good.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------Great game with a huge focus on story, characters, and world-building. I don\\'t remember the last time when the story absorbed me so much. Yes, there are a few bugs here are there, but nothing game-breaking. Usually minor visual glitches.… ExpandThe gameplay is very good. The mechanism of adding Chinese folk zombie seals is in the game. At first glance, I thought it was a domestic game. The gameplay is very good, and the skills and special effects are very cool. It is quite satisfactory, but the story content is too old-fashioned. Like many other games, the innovation is not strong. The side content and collections are quite rich. The experience time can be very long. , The plot is old-fashioned, but the emotion of the character relationship chain is quite tearful. If the sales and reputation are good, I hope there will be a sequel. I really don\\'t want KK to disappear like this.Graphically it is spectacular, and the designs of the enemies are impressive but unfortunately it is the only positive thing I can say about the game.\\nExtremely easy.\\nmonotonous and repetitive world\\nThe interface seems to be developed by Ubisoft.\\nRemarkable soundtrack.\\nI didn\\'t expect so little from a super production like this, coming from the studio founded by shinji mikami, hopefully I\\'ll take the reins of the next project to provide something excellent like the evil withing.It\\'s not a perfect game,but it\\'s a special game.If you are interested in Japanese culture,the game won\\'t let you down.i will start a review with saying that this game isnt for everyone. If you love and know japanese mythology and urban legends you will LOVE it. Enemeys and side quests each have myth or urban legend in it. Tokyo in this game is masterfully created.  Combat is way to easy if you play it on normal, so select hard. Animations with hands are amaizing aswell. Main Story is okeyish, nothing to brag about but lore of the city, side missions and enemys carry this game, atleast for me japanese fanboy. Compering it to all this bad games this year 7,5/10.the game is located in Tokyo which same location like the real world. the atmosphere and and game design including the graphic is good.\\nthe plot is interesting that include the Japanese mythical creatures which know as YOKAi\\nbut gameplay is boring same as side quest that don\\'t challenge.Ghostwire: Tokyo is the best game I\\'ve played. I passed it in 4 hours without a single death. Very cool soundtrack, plot, gameplay, graphics, atmosphere. If you haven\\'t played, then at least try it, it\\'s worth itA unique \"fps\" type game with an amazing story and gameplay. What else could you ask for? Some things are a little rough around the edges, but the game makes up for it with smooth combat and a captivating environment. The main story won\\'t take you long to complete, if you just blow through it, but if you do all the side missions and activities the game has to offer then you\\'ll get more out of it. Definitely a must try!Nice and interesting game, I liked playing it.\\nThe story is kinda meh and the cutscenes drag on forever, especially when the main opponent keeps babbling slowly for hours on end. The characters are nothing to write home about.\\nBut this is an action game, so how does it fare in terms of gameplay? Well, it\\'s very old school, think Doom with some twists. You have to move quickly, shoot quickly and little else.  You have three different magic attacks (roughly equivalent to pistol, shotgun and grenade) and a bow. In addition to these, you can use special talismans when in tight spots and block enemy hits; perfect blocks completely nullify damage and sometimes bounce back enemy attacks at them. Finally, you have a sort of rage meter, that gives you half a minute or so of super powers. Every now and then, the game will cage you in a round arena and make you confront waves of enemies or tough bosses. Everything happens at point blank or little more. It\\'s not bad, but it also leaves very little room for strategy, and repetition is excessive.\\nYou move through the city on foot, but also have limited soaring capabilities that allow you to travel on rooftops, and can move from building to building almost freely you get the requisite ability.\\nMy main gripe is the fact that the difficulty spike between normal and hard difficulty is HUGE. I started the game on hard and kept on for more than 50%, then I realized it was killing my fun. Eventually switched to normal and completed the game.\\nOn normal, even bosses pose no threat, I don\\'t think I\\'ve died once. The action is fun: you use block a lot, move quickly, dodge and hit savagely, and just eat or drink something if your health gets low. You can just avoid using talismans. On hard, it takes dozens of hits to down even the weakest enemies, they barely get staggered at all and, more importantly, even a minor hit will drain a huge amount of your health. I also think that the special ability which allows you to regain ammo by punching enemies, yields half its normal boon.\\nThis means that even common enemies are extremely dangerous, and when they attack in groups, they become deadly. Three shine dancers attacking together on the rooftops, for example, WILL kill you, unless you use your special rage attack.\\nIf you are fine dropping the more nuanced approach of modern shooters like Far Cry, and are down for some fast and furious close range combat, you can have fun with this game.I didn\\'t expect much from the game, so it was a pleasant surprise, but it would make much more sense if it was in the third person. Not in the game justifies the first person\\'s choice, so -1. In addition, the gameplay is very limited due to the mapVoid and repetitive activities, another -1.For, the upgrades offered (skills and \"equipment\") are without inspiration, giving no desire to collect the absurd 240k souls on the map to upload, so -1.No general, goodGame to spend time until another big release.Somewhat different, but very good game.Ghostwire Tokyo will imprison you into the Psychohoror Tokyo Empire interwoven with everything that can scare you in this Asian country.No music, no people, only you and countless pets running in the total wasteland of Open World, hoping their souls will remain immaculate.\\nThe game is undoubtedly FPS in which you will not find any firearms.Of course there is a strong story, many RPG elements and as a unique system of replenishing strength for attack.The official sources are an action adventure again with a lot of side tasks and my favorite Collectibles is missing.\\nWho likes horror, Tokyo or just Japanese tongue 史 or culture no matter.Do not forget that the whole event takes place at night ,, and you are alone in the whole tokyo!Rating: 5/10\\nI was really looking forward to this game since I\\'m a huge fan of Japan but this is not a good game.\\nThe story is boring and lackluster and not gripping at all. They fighting is okay but nothing special.\\nTokyo is well designed and is the highlight of the game. It feels like a walking simulator with a ton of collectables. Nothing really stands out with this game. it isn\\'t fun it isn\\'t horror it\\'s just a big sightseeing tour but not a good game. How someone can rate this 8 or even 9 is beyond me. Like others have already said they should have made The Evil Within 3 instead.\\n\\nUPDATE: Rating 7/10\\nAfter playing a couple more hours my mind has changed. Some games really take a long time till they click with you. This game sure did. Funny enough the game clicked with me when it went underground and not in the open world. That\\'s when for the first time some kind of atmosphere built up and I started enjoying the game. I also liked the plot twist and change of pace once you lose all your abilities for a while and have to sneak through the city. At almost nine hours there\\'s quiet a few things I like about this game: Like I\\'ve already said the city is designed beautiful and with a lot of attention to detail. Also some of the sidequests are really well made with sometimes deep meanings and questioning society. I really like that.  Fighting becomes a little more fun once your abilities increase.… ExpandA good game with the atmosphere and excellent graphics, although not without flaws, but still can bring pleasure with our gameplayIn my opinion, most of the reviews of users of this game are paid or in some other way “dipped” since, having played it for about 3-4 hours, I came to the conclusion that this is a poop in a more or less beautiful wrap.Understand me correctly, gameplay is a complete boredum even for 2005.All 99% agree with the review of this game from Stopgame.Played 1.5 hours.At first, the game seemed beautiful, interesting.Then my lags began and I had to cut down the RTX, and without it the picture is already so -so, but my lags did not completely disappear and for the stable 60 FPS I had to lower the graphics to the high.The game is very grind.To promote the plot, you need to grind the local avantists and clean the gate, then the fog disappears and new sections of the map are opening to you.The developers could make such a cool game, but missed their chance.I expected much more from this game, it had soo much potential but it got ruined by repetitive combat and gameplay. Side missions have no soul in them but graphics are cool with an average story.i love this game its just sit into my heart with this music characters and atmosphere',\n",
       " 'Fun game to play with my partner. The game is a bit all over the place from time to time. The studio really need to get some better actors for their child rolls. Both this kid and the kid in a way out is just anoying.The best coop.I have not received so much pleasure from passing the game for a long time.So the girl who almost does not play in the countryside.I recommend.Just a well build and beautifully crafted game for you and one of your mates. You can tell that devs were passionate about it. It starts to drag out a bit, but if you play this in several sessions this shouldn\\'t be a problem. Great game!No game has given the satisfaction this game did. Absolutely loved it. It\\'s perfect in every aspect. Movements are fun. Power ups are unique and super creative. Don\\'t even get me started with the world they created. Like damn how tf is someone so creative. This is the kind of gem that\\'s rarely ever shows up. Game is lone and it doesn\\'t feel repetitive a single time. This game is a masterpiece for me. This game deserves best. Thanks for this game EA and Hazelight. This game has a soul and it\\'s beautiful.Amazing coop game again from hazlelight studios. About the only game I would buy from EA.Great story, gameplay was the best coop I\\'ve ever playedThe perfect game to play with your partner.Approximately about 15 hours and with a complete diversity of scenarios and skills.The game is incredibly diverse in terms of gameplay and that\\'s cool. It\\'s also fun to play two and we have a good time. But for me the game quickly became nondescript and I couldn\\'t wait for it to end. The challenge is nice but nothing more, it\\'s certainly not a GOTY for me anyway!This is genuinely a great game full of moment to moment fun. It’s basically a puzzle platformer with a story, but There is a huge variety of mechanics, so it never gets old. If you are a fan of the genre, or especially if you have a kid to who wants to play games with you, this is a must have.Solid 10 for me infact I wish I could rate this higher! Game is stunning, storyline has a good mix of emotional moments which are countered with comedy when the emotions get to sad! Takes approximately 14 hours to complete but every area has different tools and abilities to make it fun and mini games! The only downside? This game ruins other co op storyline driven games that can’t live up to the innovation hazelight has put into this gameEvery now again in life something comes along which is revolutionary, something that sets a new bar. This game is exactly that. It’s flawless, remarkable, polished and every step is breathtaking. Hands down, the best co-op game ever produced by mankind to date.For sure it’s a game of the year! Amazing story, design, music, gameplay. One of the best game I ever played.This game is the perfect combination of creativity, passion and Col-lab-or-a-tion!This game is great, I was shocked at how Much I like it.  Also, ANY studio that is willing to sell a game, that you gotta play with people, and your friend Online can play for free, Is okay by me, Loved A Way out, and this is another Hit. I hope it sells great and they do sequels to both gamesThe game is simply incredible - very interactive, interesting, fascinating.\\nThe variety of game mechanics, an unusual stylistics, an exciting plot, is even in a coop - in general you will not have time to get bored, and you will get the pleasure of an incredible one.Clearly deserves attention)The best gaming experience I have ever had, absolutely incredible, 100 different gaming mechanics and ideas, every level completely unique, pure genius, my mind still tries to handle that level design brilliance, coop in its finest, the word coop gets totally new heightsThis game is just wonderful, there are SO MANY unique environments and game mechanics. The amount of assets this game has is staggering. A masterpiece co-op platformer that\\'s GOTY worthyMy girlfriend and I just beat the game and we had so much fun! The artstyle and creative co-op gameplay is absolutely amazing! Hazellight really put there heart into this game, it\\'s wonderful!Unique, fun and thrillng game with an absolutley wonderful narrative. Sure, it might not be for everybody because of the coop only restrictions but my oh my have I missed a game designer truly for two players.Coop masterpiece, amazing art design, fun, fun, fun, beautiful and really breathtakingWhat else should I say... this game is by all means truly absolutely amazing!!! A massive shoutout to the dev team Hazelight.This game is nothing short of a masterpiece. It\\'s fast paced with no dull moments at all. The challenge in combat is fair with the only complaint being that the puzzles could have been slightly tougher.The most creative level design since Psychonauts gets paired with cringe-inducing cast of extraordinarily unlikeable protagonists. Characters have little to offer beyond vapid quips and non-stop obnoxious banter. All attempts at emotional moments have a subtlety of a hippopotamus and depth of a puddle. Once Hazelight ups their writing to the same level as the rest of the team, we\\'re in for a timeless classic. It Takes Two ain\\'t it.IT Takes Two I can easily say the most enjoyable and most beautiful coop & split screen game I have ever played. Joseph Fares has done a great job again as usual after A Way Out. The length of the game was one of the elements that attracted my attention to the fact that it was longer than many games. It is so clear that every episode has been dealt with. The Easter EGGs in the game and the mini -games you discovered in the game (there are 25 available) with your friends, a moment of breathing and challenges each other allows you to struggles for many different mechanics. I love it in one word! This year is a strong candidate as a platform at Game of the Year Gaming Awards! Resident Evil Village is also quite ambitious. This is my favorite from this year\\'s games. The buyer can play with an invitation system with a friend without a game. I played over PlayStation 5 Dualsserse features were quite enjoyable, the game had added a completely different atmosphere. Play, play.Best co-op game out there! Cool and creative game mechanics. Much variation, you never get bored. Masterpiece.My (5yo) son loves this game and so do I. Fantastic game world and most levels are very well designed. I love Fares Fares for making these couch coop games, a genre forgotten by so many others. This is his best game so far and I recommend this game to anyone who like couch coop games young or old. Strong 9, borderline 10.I recommend everyone to play this game with their loved one. Great game with simple graphics but real relationships.For me, this game is a Masterpiece period\\nthe level design is absolutely georgus, the story is amazing, and the gameplay is beyond fun, this game reminds me of the old-time when they make real games, the game is solid well built, and the graphics are amazing.\\nTHANK YOU for making this game.It Takes Two\\nto make a thing go right\\nIt takes towo is a 12 hour long co op based puzzle platforming game and this is the best co op gave ive ever played in my life.\\nHere you play as either May or Cody… This game does require you play with two people either online or locally, I played locally with my girlfriend, she was May, I was cody… Your daughter is sad the two of you are getting divorced, the classic magic tears happen and next thing you know, the both of you wake up in the bodies of these 2 dolls,and you have a spansish love doctor in the form of the book of love there to help you find love again, all while the two of you are trying to break the spell and get back in your bodies…. The levels area variety of puzzles, and its that variety that makes it takes two such an amazing game, as again this game is 12 hours long, variety is an absolute necessity.. and because of that, each level here almost feels like a new puzzle game itself… each time youre given a new ability or weapon for that level specifically, which also makes this game so accessible, theres no need to remember every tool or control the game throws at you, as every hour or 2, you throw that item away for a new one, and I loved that..I loved knowing that if im not liking the gameplay of a particular section, that if I just puh through, ill be given a new fresh style of gameplay and not have to deal with it anymore.. and hey.. if you are playing locally and you like one persons ability more than the others, you could just switch characters if theyre willing.. I personally played as cody the whole time… the game does do a great job at switching who gets th better ability… though I feel mostly cody is stuck with the here, let me move this or hold this while you have all the fun platforming… I felt like the cogs inside of a platforming level quite a few times while playing… an interesting idea that im sure would be a pain development wise, is the ability to chose who gets what before a level starts or the ability to switch items as the level goes on.. either to switch things up for each player, or for moments of strengths and weaknesses to play out in the actual people playing… it wasn’t that big of a deal having your ability already pre chosen based on the character you are.. but the choice would’ve been nice.. overall though I absolutely love It Takes Two.. you get a touching story, gameplay variety that revels the likes of a Mario game, and one the most if no the most amazing co op experience in gaming history… it has its moments of this just isn’t fun, and I would’ve like more action sequenes thrown in there than we got, just to break up the puzzle solving more… but it takes two is near masterpiece status, and is a must play for you and that other person in your life…\\nI give It Takes Two\\na 9.5/10**** the Oscar\" man again made an amazing game! One of the best coop game in history!My expectations were high to begin with, based on Hazelight\\'s former two games that I quite enjoyed. Then my first impression with this game was that it\\'s the best two player co-op out there. But even that was exceeded with the realization that there is simply no comparison with anything else, for this is something very unique.Hazelight is doing wonders with their two characters formula. Their first game had two brothers, then two prison breaking allies, and now a husband and wife at the verge of a divorce with a daughter caught in the middle. All these three stories were simple, yet the journies were vibrant. But the true highlight of It Takes Two is how this journey consistently stays fresh and saturated for very many hours where you are constantly faced with new kinds of challenges, and a new set of tools to tackle them. More on that later.If you are a couple with access to this game, there is not much need for dilemma. It\\'s an exceedingly fleshed out AAA game for half the price, that can entertain two players with a single purchase, even if you play online. That already makes it well worth the money. On top of that, the game is simply an endless buffet that is sure to surpass your appetite.But, there are a couple of big red warnings. Firstly, this is not a casual game. After playing their last game A Way Out, we were expecting some laid back fun. But this game will put even a seasoned gamer to test. Moreover, one person won\\'t be able to carry both. Both the players will need to climb steep learning curves, together.Secondly, the game\\'s genre has been phrased as a \"romantic comedy\", not for the lack of a better word, but because there would have been too many words. This game packages a ton of genres into one, constantly changing to remain consistently fresh. So players with limited preferences may not enjoy it. If you enjoy Mortal Kombat but not Dark Souls, you\\'re gonna have a hard time. If you enjoy Mario but not Tomb Raider, you\\'re gonna have a hard time. Bear that in mind.I crave new ideas. And this game is a roller coaster ride through a fun fair of newness.  I don\\'t like to recommend anything, but do check it out, and it may speak to you.It takes two is absolutely fantastic. Never do you feel like the gameplay or mechanics are repetitive.. literally every moment is unique and it was so much fun to play with my partner:-) the story was great, there was great character development and I really enjoyed the narrative choices that they made 10/10This game can only be defined as the definitive coop experience. It runs, feels, plays, and looks amazing.The biggest surprise of this year .. My son loves the game.She is very funny and brilliant.Amazing creative game with different game play elements every few (!) minutes. Never boring, never same from the beginning to the end, and always fun. Technicallly stunning and beautiful with AAA production values. Ironically it comes from EA and with the purchase of the Hazelight developers EA increased their number of creative studios by 100%.I have been playing with my wife and it has been a blast! The variety of mechanics and gameplay are great. This game could have been a 10/10 if they didn\\'t have a certain book in the game. Some story elements are cringe - but the gameplay is so good I dont really notice.A great game. There are a lot of different and interesting mechanics. I advise everyone.Good cookies have become a rarity.A WAY OUT left only positive emotions at one time.This game surpassed her, excellent drawing, interesting game mechanics.It is a pleasure to go through it.The perfect co-op adventure-platformer for you and your girlfriend. Even if she is not a gamer. Extremely fun and enjoyable! Laughed all the way through!What can i say about this game that people haven\\'t already said. It\\'s sooooo good!! i don\\'t really like to give a full 10 out of 10 review unless the game is pretty much flawless. and this game really is. Everything about this game is just so well done, the puzzles and boss are so incredibly well designed, they\\'re both fun and challenging but without being too hard to be annoying. The character controls are spot on and with each changing weapon or tool, endless fun. and man does this game look good! we\\'ve  been playing on PS5 and each we enter a new area, we\\'re just gobsmacked at the detail and graphics. For us this is a must play for everyone, it\\'s hard to describe just how good this game is! just please go and play it.Simply surprising, I wasn\\'t giving much, I just found it fun in the trailer.But playing local coop, how sensational!Very well done and well thought out in each new challenge of each phase.Having fun much more than I imagined.I recommend it a lot!I have absolutely nothing to complain about the game, because it does perfectly everything that is proposed.The sheer number of fun and interesting mechanics along with memorable set piece moments had me grinning from ear to ear for nearly the entire game. Possibly the best pure co-op game I\\'ve played in over a decade. More games like this please.One of the best games in recent years.Merry, touching, without monotonous mechanics.Yuseph Farez turned a masterpiece, which will have a long time in your soul!I recommend to all.Im blown away by this game. No bugs, amazing, fun & mind blowing game play. Graphics are gorgeous and out of this world on the PS5. The story is ok but the rest of the game is perfect. Best 2 player game.The game is Game of the Year level, fun guaranteed.I recommend playing with a known friend or friend.Each chapter changes the gameplay, the game\\'s design is breathtaking!Recommended.If i ever felt giving a game a 10 out of 10 then it\\'s this one. The controls are so good i never really felt hindered by them, the platforming is great, the puzzles are interesting and fun, the graphics are amazing and there are always new gameplay mechanics in every chapter and they nailed them all and i don\\'t know how they did it. The game is also pretty long, has a good story with fun characters with a nice character ark. Overall i can\\'t think a single aspect of this game that isn\\'t just brilliant. Two words that describe this game perfectly: Creativity and perfectionismI Just Can Say Awesome...One of Best Games I\\'ve ever Played... Thank You Josef Fares...Thank You...Completed in PLATINUM TROPHY\\nGame Completed : April 29, 2021\\nPlaying Hours : Around 20 hrs\\n\\nBefore anything else, this game is a MASTERPIECE and a MUST PLAY by everyone. It introduces a lot of concepts that wasn\\'t adapted from other games. It is super fun and the experience is new, unique and original. it never fails to surprise you as you play and progress to the next level, and there were no boring moment  and it is not short! surprisingly. It is very innovative and diverse and looks so beautiful. To make it short, Welcome to the next-gen gaming experience.\\n\\nStory/Narrative : 10/10\\nGameplay : 11/10\\nSound/Music : 10/10\\nFun Factor : 10/10\\nGraphics : 10/10\\nReplayability : 11/10It Takes Two continued to baffle me throughout the whole game. In my personal book, it goes down as one of the most streamlined but genius platformers to date. My SO and I have enjoyed the gorgeous journey with laughter and joy every single segment. The care and love that has been put behind all the mechanics are insane - it\\'s almost like we\\'re playing a different game each session!\\n\\nThis game is a must have!Best cooperative games ever. Fares are cooperative Kojima ;) God bless this stuff. Absolutely fabulous in every aspect.  It is not able to get bored.Nothing bad to say about the game. I would say one of the best co-op games I\\'ve ever played. Cody and May are put on this journey and you are right there to see it unravel. The controls are amazing and the amount of mechanics never make the game boring. this game was a passion project and it shows. This is my game of the year in 2021 so far and I would recommend this game to anyone.… Expand10/10 Best game over the past half years/year in which I played :) Minus only for too light levels.The best two-player cooperative game right now.Creative level and gameplay design.An entertaining game that does not stop surprising you by level.I saw nothing more elegant, original and charming from Overcook 2. If yours is team collaboration, whether with your partner, a friend or any online, I promise that they will not be disenchanted.It is the best I have played for many years.The best game for PS5 is at the moment. Very many different, and interesting mechanics and good plot, I will wait for the next games from the developerThe game exceeded all expectations!So juicy visually and gapleyno that the entry at 10 hours seemed one instant.The game is not for children, since the product is focused on an adult audience. It would be 10/10, but the motivation of the characters and their hard -faced suspended.No support for Dualensa\\'s capabilitiesIt’s just PERFECT perfect perfect evyjxjdjdjjdjdjjdjdjdjjdjdjdjdjdjjdjjrjjrjrjrLet me begin by saying this is one of the best coop games I have played since like Bug and Taz time travel game (ps1) yes I have play a lot others and Lego games two but none have come close to this feeling of fun since I was a kid playing with my sister, the game  looks beautiful I haven\\'t played the ps4 version but  the ps5 load extremely fast i have not see any loading screen yet  my and my wife are enyojing this so much I have to come here and share some love for the game as well it is a good ride enjoy guys and support this amazing gameMy wife and I are about half way through the game and are absolutely loving it. I\\'d give it a 10 but the book of love is annoying and the animation in human form is a little off. The actual gameplay though is amazing. My wife, who easily gets frustrated at games and wants to quit said that this is her game of the year.THE marvelous and incredible spectacle. This perfect game for kids and adults won\\'t leave you cold or alone. 10/10 overall. A must-play game for every single atom in the universe.Story 4/10\\nGameplay 10/10\\n\\nThis is 100% Coop (Local-Online) Game --No single player\\nI can see this game becoming one of the best Coop experience of this Gen and next( ps4-ps5)\\nThe gameplay keeps re introducing new elements the further it proceeds. It has so many elements and it never siezes to amaze me on how creative it gets.\\n\\nIf you wish to play the game online  with a friend ONLY 1 of you has to buy the game. The other will simply have to download a file called It Takes Two Friend Pass!Totally nice game. Love it.....................................................Is the best co-op game, good story, magnificent graphics - art style, levels, enemies and bosses, And perfect gameplay. This game dont have negatives points is so perfect for couples and really nice for best friend.A perfect local co-op story game in a time in which local co-op is forgotten. Also, the aspect of having online co-op is especially important as well during a pandemic and for any long-distance relationships. A simple story, with many cute references and mini-games, at a good price. This is totally worth it and I hope Hazel Light continues to put out masterpieces like this for those of us who still love local co-op. To be honest, the story (and the final trophy) made me cry and the use of vibration at times helped with immersion. I will definitely continue to buy from and respect Hazel Light, and I recommend everyone (children, parents, couples, friends) play this game.The best co-op game ever made. So many different mechanics feels like many different games in one. Buddy pass works so well I feel bad for not buying two copies. More games should do this.It Takes Two, is a masterclass in level design, storytelling, cheezy humor, and making games just for the sake of it being fun.It’s strictly co-op via local or online invite, it’ll make you laugh, cry, etc.Most games that do different genres end up being a jack of all trades but masters of none. ITT manages to be a master of all, weaving platformingn and small touches from other genres into such a special game. It’s insaneAbsolute 10/10 PLEASE BUY THIS GAMEIt takes two is a masterful blend of constant new ideas, fun gameplay mechanics, and a pretty good story. This game of course requires 2 players, but that vision is fully though out, and made perfectly. This game has something new every half an hour. This is a must play for anyone who has some friend to play it with, its so good. just good, amazing. 9.9/10.It’s a master piece and we need more games like this. If you have friends, play this gorgeous game with them. Stunning graphics, awesome music/sounds, great mini games and so much detail to everything. It’s a 14/10! Don’t miss it!Game of the year Game of the year Game of the year Game of the yearGame of the yearGreat game! There is so much variety and the gameplay is very entertaining. The creativity in this game is top notch and I love co-op games. There are just too few available. Grab a friend who is decent at video games. To play it with your significant other the game might be a bit too difficult.I didn‘t enjoy the story as much as the story of „a way out“ but that didn‘t bother me in any way.One of the best games of 2021 so far    .I am delighted with the game. I can’t remember the best coop. I do not know how it is played on other platforms, but PS5 is wonderful.\\n\\nFor me, the main difference from other similar games is the supply of characters with new abilities throughout the game. Those. The game is contrary to the template, where you were conditionally given resources and turn the whole game with them - entertain yourself, solve puzzles. Here, the characters are with each level in different conditions, while each of the characters has unique abilities, without which the second player cannot advance. It resembles something Portal, but in Portal the ability is still the same (call the portal).\\n\\nI also want to note the bosses. They are beautiful.\\n\\nSummarizing - this best game for passing with the second half. Trine, UNRAVEL just smoke and cry aside.I tried to decide between a 9 and a 10. I dont like awarding 10s because perfection...really? But when I try to think of what they could have done better...I come up empty. It Takes Two is so well designed, so well written, so pretty....its just so good!This game will win many game of the year awards and deservedly so.Gaming perfection.That is how the Game should look like. Shame to all triple-A studios with their game-like crap.Without a doubt the best game of life. The game surprises in each of its sections, showing a fascinating visual style and game mechanics that hook from the first moment. The story falls in love from the beginning to the end. The best gameI have tried in years.If Way Out was already a great game that showed the path they could start to travel the Co-Op games, this it Takes Two is a great evolution in almost all aspects.\\n\\nAt the playable level it is a 10, I can only \"but\" that for demanding players it is a \"very easy\" difficulty game.\\n\\nEnvironments and design, another 10, aesthetics, the quantity and variety of scenarios is immense and very well carried out.\\n\\nMusic and sounds, they do not stand out, but they don\\'t remain either.\\n\\nThe history?Maybe a little flat, and with some cinematics a little creepy, but more than acceptable and with the book/Dr.hakim giving the note very positively.\\n\\nWhy a 9 and not a 10?\\nThe negative points: excessively simple difficulty, a bitter taste, perhaps a step below the last stage with respect to the rest of the game.\\n\\nDefinitely a great game to enjoy a friend or partner.It takes it is simply amazing, the game overflows creativity and new game mechanics from beginning to end and is never repetitive, it is a very worthwhile cooperative experience and one of the best platforms I have ever playedThis game is a masterpiece! I think we should give more credit for games that launch without any bugs in its complete form to provide the best experience possible. It Takes Two is a beacon of light in an industry that showcases big time marketed games being launched in incomplete states.  I played this game with my wife and it hit home for us because we have a newborn son! If you value family and have a significant other to play with, It Takes Two will be a blast to experience (especially if you are a millennial). A game with a deep message of family, partnership and overcoming adversity. It\\'s a must play. And a game I\\'m looking forward to playing with my son when he gets older.Easily, EASILY one of the best co-op games out there. But only play if you have a friend who knows how to play videogames as it does require some skills. I can\\'t understand people who give a low score to this game. They must not be very good at games in general or dont have anybody to play with. Don\\'t let the negative reviews turn you away from this game. Support it please! so we can have more wonderful coop games like this one.\\n\\nOnly thing i can think of that isnt good about this game is that the writing is lacking a bit but in general it gets the job done.this is how you do two player co-op correctly. The fact that you have unlimited lives also makes this a great game to play with someone not as skilled in platforming. Currently going through the mission with my girlfriend and shes having a blast (usually she gets frustrated when she dies often). Memorable characters as well, cant recommend this enough for some couch co-op.just nice co-op story game game. Fun . interesting and with a good picture .While the story is not as engaging and Dr Hakim is cringy and annoying everything else makes up for it.I don\\'t remember having so much fun in a video game ever before. That\\'s what the games suppose to be. Fun.One of the best coop games my wife and I have ever played together. It pulls off frequently changing mechanics and blends light, surface level material while exploring a couple learning to understand each other better. If an average new Pixar movie is 2.5 hours long and cost $15, then this game that lasts around 14 hours in our case is easily with the $40 it costs, and much more enjoyable than many of those movies in my opinion. Recommend for couples especially.Wonderful couch co-op with my wife. 100/10 one of the best games ive ever played so far so good really sooo goodOne of the most fun, rewarding and unique experiences I\\'ve ever had. It\\'s one of the best platformers out there but more importantly manages to intertwine gameplay and mechanics so welll into the overall narrative to a degree that I did not experience in any other game thus far. Those games are very rare and only come by maybe once or twice a generation. Definitely a very very strong GOTY contender and because of its one of a kind narrative gameplay design ultimatley a game that brings the whole medium forward.This is one of the best games I\\'ve ever played! I recommend to everyone to buy.It takes two is a co-op masterpiece that every fan of the platforming and puzzle genre should experience. A clear 10/10 and a GOTY contender in my bookFantastic gameplay mechanics that never overstay its welcome. Each chapter feels fresh and makes it so there’s never a dull moment. The co op puzzles and mini games add an extra flavor to the mix. Some of the best fun you’ll find in a game.An absolute Joy of creative expression that flows elegantly between levels seamlessly.\\n\\nUnique, entertaining and well paced. Even my wife who isn\\'t a gamer just wanted to keep playing.\\n\\nWe will probably play it again as the opposite characters without it feeling stale or old in the least . It surely has to be noted in the game of the year listings.One if the best game ive Play since long Time, really various gameplay, funny moment and a real refreshing coop game really thank Hazelight and EA for this master coop pièce.It is a very creative game and I really like that it is totally cooperative 100% recommended and it is worth each dollar paidPhenomenal Game from Earl to the great end to play with a friend, wonderful voice acting, funny and super funPerfect game for two people to play couch coop. Charming characters, witty dialogue. It’s not meant to be taken too seriously and overall is a blast. Every hour or so of gameplay it mixes things up with new mechanics, subplots, and unique items which makes it hard to put down as you can’t wait to get to the next chapter. Visually it is incredibly striking with a vibrant color palette high resolution and steady frame rate. Not to mention spectacular set pieces that make it feel like Michael Bay directing a Pixar short film. I could not recommend any game more to a casual audience, but even more experienced players will have a great time with this one.Fan of hazelight games already but this game truly blew my expectations out the window. Great co op game, fantastic levels with such great atmosphere and detail including the mini games. Length of the game was also nice - didn’t get bored once. Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys adventure and playing with a friend.I created an account just to review this game. It Takes Two is a must play masterpiece.It\\'s just an amazing, fun game to play, with tons of different mechanics. 10/10the best co-op game so far!co..lla.. bo..ra..tion !!25 mini games it perfect but for someone greedy like me i wished some moreVery good game, very entertaining with good music and graphics!Highly recommended!Excellent benefit relationship.This game is so good dude. No one will ever say that they didn\\'t like this game.  People who didn\\'t like it were just unhappy that the game is coop only or the only thing they care about a video game is story (even tho the story is pretty good even for a game that is not aiming to be mainly story driven). If this game was to be played by 1 player and the other being played by bots, the game would be **** Hazelight studios made the right call by just making this a coop only game because this game is made to be played by your friend, partner or sibling and you guys will 100% love and love this gameIt takes two has given me one of the best gaming experiences I’ve had, ever. The story holds deep meaning and substance and teaches many valuable lessons that I think most can benefit from hearing. The gameplay is wonderful, the feel of the game is great. The way Hazelight managed the different abilities and mechanics never ceased to amaze me. All the different areas have a distinct and enjoyable feel to it, without being repetitive at all. I will replay this as much as I can, until I get bored by it. The game is so good I even made an account here to rate the game.Game is really fun but to short and kinda cheesy but great gameplay along with split screen is amazing! They should do a horror or detective game.',\n",

       " 'As a tech demo to demonstrate the dual sense controller. The greatest tech demo ever created so easily a 10 nothing tops itSimple review: it\\'s just a nice game to try the features of the new console. Nice platform game. (Nice Easters eggs)To be a demo to start with the PS5 the award and to demonstrate the abilities of the Dualsense command, I have to admit that they have put a lot of effort in the game.What I like most is how it gives you a tutorial to use the new functions of the command and the second is that the levels are decorated with objects from the PlayStation past and that small Easter Eggs can be found with iconic playstation charactersBasically the Playstation Mario to show off the DualSense... Mate, this game is insane and an incredible pleasure to your hands. A bit short, but lot\\'s of replayability and accessible for all players young and old. Also features speedrun courses vs the world, in which you can sink hours to master the course.Dude, aside from what everyone mentioned in terms of being a fantastic tech demo and all. The freakin love that was put into this, the easter eggs.. EVERYTHING screams playstation nostalgia. If you grew up around Playstation.. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE OUTIts a free game and amazing nostalgic adventure.I feel very happy after play this game with DualSense. Congrats Asobi TeamI really don’t think Sony realise how great AstroBot is. It is simply flawless, imaginative, polished and perfect. They really need to make more of these, immersive for kids and adults alike. I’d give it 11 if I could.This is currently the best game on the PS5. Although it is not particularly long, it may be the most straightforward fun launch title on any PlayStation system to date.Frankly, the best experience of the beginning of a generation for me was with this wonderful game, because it came to us in a new and distinctive way, unlike any game in which we have the previous generations, but it explained to me the characteristics of the countries that will forget me to dazzle me very wonderfully and difficult to forget because of the frequent application, unlike the normal explanation, you can forget some characteristics, and beautifulVery with its worlds and interacting with it and otherwise it was full of memories with the previous generations and the one who increased the pleasure I sealed with my young brothers and the first time I see them integrating with such and such game for more than two hours I advise anyone before playing any game that saves it and then enjoy the deviceAmazing besides showing all the features of control and a very fun gameExcellent platform/demo to demonstrate the abilities of the Dualsense, is delighted.this whole game is the definition of fun really. it\\'s so unbelieveable that its free, it feels like a 40$ game and ill pay that for itsuch a great game. i absolutely love it. it\\'s perfect introduction to ps5.Great game. The most next-gen game out right now. It’s cute. It’s fun. It’s nostalgic. 10/10People view it as a demo for the ps5 but its a full game with amazing haptic feedback and graphics. Its such a nostalgic game for gamers who had the other playstation consoles. You will love it!I confess I didn\\'t expect it so much, because it\\'s free kkkk but I found it very topAstro\\'s playroom is a wonderful short but sweet 3D platformer with tons of charm. It feels like a mix of Super Mario 3D World level design with tight controls and more unique environments. The theme of the game taking place inside your PS5 and having all of the major games being recorded there is a very cute concept and a good excuse to put in plenty of fanservice. And the best part is, it\\'s absolutely free!  If you pick up a PS5, please don\\'t let this one pass you by.A plate full for PS5 owners.A game packed with easter eggs is very tasty to platinum taking all the collectibles.For those born there after the 80s and before the 2000s and enjoyed all generations of the PS will love this game!The part of the control is sensational.The accuracy of haptic feedback is amazing.Beautiful and engaging free game that showcases the power of the dualsense controller. Definitely recommend playing.Gorgeous game!Incredible gameplay, cool interaction with dualsens.Immersion inside the console is a super scenario, nostalgia for PS1-3.Cool platformer!Story: 10\\nGraphics: 8\\nSound: 10\\nGameplay: 10\\nGame Time: 5 Hours (Main Story) + ExtraI love this game so much. Absolutely rock solid and playable platformer, endlessly enjoyable, lots of secrets to explore, imaginative, humourous and adorable. The music was absolutely banging (turn Jungle GPU up loud) and the PlayStation nostalgia was a wonderful touch. They went to lengths to explain that it was \\'just a tech demo\\' but it\\'s so much more... but also... WHAT a tech demo. The use of the Dual Sense controller on every PS5 game I\\'ve played since has been a disappointment. Wonderful stuff.This game is not only the single best demo for the new controller, but also a really nice game as well! And it\\'s completly free and pre-installed, which is simply amazing from Sony, thanks! Keep up the good work!Fun packed fun for the whole family! Kids can’t stop playing it and neither can I!The Game is better than I thought it would be. Everything is awesome. The music, the graphics. EVERYTHINGExceeded my expectations in a best way. Was only expecting a short tech demo, but it turned out to be a stellar platformer as well. It only takes a few hours to beat and a few more to get plat but I was having fun all these time. Plus it\\'s free, so yeah!Really fun game! Easy 10/10, and I do not care so much about dualsense triggers, the game is great.Mind blowing experience one of the best platform game a playstation 5 icon Dualsense is an inventionAn excellent platform game that constantly innovates and makes people discover the possibilities of the controller, I was expecting nothing from that game, and finally it is with him that I spent my first 6 hours of games on PS5, a successful game especially since it\\'s included with the console.\\nAlso I loved the theme of the PS5 hardware explored in the various levels of the game and the various nods to the old PlayStations.Wow Astro\\'s Playroom is a amazing showcase of the DualSense controller and capabilities that the PS5 has! I totally did not expect to love this game so much. The graphics, music soundtrack, and haptic feedback are all amazing.\\n\\nI would go so far as to say that Astro\\'s Playroom is the best casual platformer that I have ever played and proves Sony can do it better than anybody else on the market! Astro\\'s Playroom is a love letter from Sony to it\\'s fans. Thank you Sony for this fun and amazing game!Great way to figure out what the PS5 controller is capable of. You’ll be able to control this mascot be put in his feet, you’ll feel what he feels and love every second of it.Very fun game with the use of Dualsense and beautiful references to the history of PlayStation.The best gaming experience you can get from a new generation, I love it. Need more games like thisThis game was made to show off the amazing dualsense controller for the PS5, and boy oh boy, it nailed it. It\\'s also a reminiscent of the playstation era. A great start to next-gen, with very fun platformer gameplay, ala Mario Odyssey. The downside, it\\'s very short.Absolutely astonishing little game that\\'s so much more than just a tech demo. If only there was more of it, I\\'d love to see a full feature game of it.This game blew my mind. It may just be a tech demo but it was genuinely a really fun game. I wished it didn\\'t end, I would LOVE a full game of this. I\\'ll definitely to back and play it again. Just wish it was longer! Not a bad moment in the game. And it looks  AMAZING.Spectacular from beginning to end.It shows that they have done it with love and she is not just a demo of command as some believed.From 10.A very good showcase of the amazing features of Dualsense 5. I enjoyed this game just because it used those mechanics very often and in big variety. That was the purpose after all. As a game, it\\'s fun to play as well.What better way to explore your new long awaited console than with Astro\\'s Playroom? Thank you Sony for taking a page out of Nintendo\\'s playbook. The last time I had this much fun with an out of the box Tech Demo was Wii Sports back in 2006.This game is so awesome they need to make an actual RPG out of this this is Sony’s Mario and Zelda actually had more fun playing this than Mario or Zelda 10 out of 10Best platform game Sony has ever made, very nice to review the story of PlayStation.And how amazing that this DualSense, 100% sure that is the most next-gen thing shown until Agr.What a great way to start enjoying your new console. Astro\\'s is a great platformer game, it is a great introduction to the controller and a great way to pay homage to the old and welcome the new. The haptics feedback and adaptive triggers, paired with controller sound and game design work really well. There is something happening at all times and even though some might say it\\'s too much, I think it is intentionally designed that way. You get a good enough time to get used to your new controller and get a taste of what to expect from the rest of the console features. Fast load times make going for the platinum a great experience and the few hints are good enough to keep you collecting stuff until the last few trophies that might require some online guide help.By the time you have finished the game, you will feel at home with how the new controller work and thus use and implementation in other games will feel less than a novelty and more like a welcomed addition to your gaming experience, and that is great. You\\'ll be less distracted by how things work and will be able to concentrate on just enjoying the experience.Not a 10 as it is not a legendary masterpiece, but it does the job it set out to do extremely well and it is a must play for all new console owners. And the speed run challenges are great and might keep you coming back for a few minutes/hours at a time to grab back your #1 place among your friends.Dualsense has literally changed the game and this game is its showcase. Great platformer that offers immersion like no other game due to the controller. So much fun and a great first Platinum for the next generation of PlayStation.An extremely awesome game with the complete PlayStation history and all features of the Dual Sense Controller which make the Game an Unique.This game is very good, it is very entertaining, I bought PS5 also because I want to play this gamemagnificent demo for the dualscense but actually a pretty fun game for launch of the ps5An incredible showcase for the new console. Best usage of the DualSense till now.Simple game, full of references, graphically pleasant, free and a tribute to all fans and even the PlayStation brand.\\nHe is challenging, good for those who want to do Speedruns and is even easy to platinum (I in 3 days planned 91%)The dualsense is a game changer  definitely a big reason why this game is so fun. Its definitely a must play because its pre installedAn amazing little game. Might not be long (took me 4 hours to get the platinum trophy) but it is full of heart. Amazing music, stylish gameplay, a great introduction into the DualSense and just in general a hard trip down memory lane. Amazing! I hope we see more of Astro in the near future!This game is so much fun! The graphics are really great looking how stylized they are, and Astro is so cute lol. Its pretty short of a game but it\\'s got a good amount of content. The greatest part of this game is what Sony did with the controller,  every surface you walk on you can feel in the controller and shooting the bow or gun feels amazing! Can\\'t beat the price of it either haha! Great job Sony!!Every time I jump back to the game I have a huge smile on my face. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers do magic! and finding small references to the history of playstation and its exclusives in every corner is great. Plus, don\\'t forget to use Activity cards, it cuts that fast loading times in half!Showing something new, that is and the new generation, congratulations Sonynice GameIf you\\'ve ever played a previous playstation console, this game serves as a love letter & tribute to those memories. Not only does this game stand up and perform brilliantly as a 3D platformer, it also does an unbelievable job as a tech demo showcasing exactly what the dualsence haptic feedback controller is capable of. Which is so impressive you really do have to experience this by playing as words can\\'t describe it well enough you simply have to feel it for yourself. There is so many little moments where you see little bots recreating scenes from your favourite games. As I have been playing all generations of playstation consoles this was a lot of nostalgia.  I haven\\'t seen anyone playing this game without a big old smile on their faces. It\\'s absolutely brilliant. It\\'s a fun platinum trophy to get. The game isn\\'t too long but you could spend hours upon hours playing the speed run sections mastering the courses and getting your times down to best your friends scores in the leaderboards. I couldn\\'t reccomend this game more. 10/10 and it\\'s free, pre installed on every PS5... And that\\'s a great price! Play this game.It\\'s a must play through and through for this particular console launch! The best way to introduce you to this new system is with Astro\\'s Playroom.It could not be better experience to try the Dualsense command, hopefully this game is as a proof of what the command is capable of doing and does not remain in 4 games.Beautiful. Great Platformer. Way to put PS5 to the fullest. Sony did good.10/10By far the best pack-in game, even surpassing wii sports! The haptics are next-level. The triggers feel outstanding. Every surface feels different, from sand to metal to ice. You can feel each raindrop with the dualsense! The sounds from the controller compliment the haptics to enhance the feeling as well. The game utilizes every bell and whistle of the dualsense and I cannot wait to see what other developers do with the haptics and triggers moving forward .As a game, it was delightfully charming. Astro is very adorable. The music is fun and the levels have may secrets to uncover. The game also serves as a tribute to Playstation history and is done very well.I highly recommend that new PS5 owners start with this game as it not only shows you what the console can do but amps you up to enjoy your new PS5. In fact, I almost feel like other launch games are lackluster as they don\\'t utilize the full breadth of features of the dualsense. Astro\\'s Playroom sets a high bar for future games.Amazing game that showcases the power of the new DualSense controller and the next generation of gaming. What a cute and wonderful platforming adventure this game is!Very good game, had tons of fun, and as a tech demo it really shocked me. Very good way to show new features and felt like an overall pristine experience!Incredible game with so much nostalgia, just it would never end! Finished it in one play through as I couldn’t put it down!Not only a great DualSense showcase but also a really fun game - if you include a tech demo on a new console, do it like Sony.Demo game included in every PS5 where you discover the features of the new Dualsense, a wonderful game full of memories of the whole PS5 era, definitely the ps5 mascot, as soon as you try it you come a smile: DThis sort of felt like an interactive museum. Really cool what they\\'ve done and a great way to show pride in their past and now present hardware. Makes me feel good about my investment in a ps5.It\\'s really a very good platform game.I had a lot of fun playing this game. Very good work.The game is amazing. I would love to have continuation of this game in full scale. I think this is the only game of new generation in 2020Best gane ever!, the gane play, the references, the sound, the way it shows the control, the desing and graphics, great gameAfter playing this game I had to sign up to metacritic to give a review. This might be the best game I ever played. The DualSense experience is pretty amazing while playing this game. The music is very uplifting and happy. This is a game we all need in 2020.\\n\\nAnd suddenly I wish Zelda BOTW was playable with DualSense.This game was truly amazing. Getting the platinum for it as a long time playstation fan was well worth it and I was able to find and understand just about every Easter egg in the game. Truly a masterpiece and I want more from ASTRO. I want a full game or a sequel of some sort.• Very good story as you get to go through PlayStation\\'s history\\n• Gameplay is very fun and enjoyable\\n• Great use of the Haptic Feedback and the Adaptive Triggers\\n• Easy Platinum for Trophy Hunters\\n\\n• Relatively shortA really curved platform game, in which it allows you to try the new dualsense functions in conditions.It is also highlighted the originality of the same, which allows youIt was my first PS5 game, as it was a free showcase of the new Dualsense. And it was great. I didn\\'t expect the PS5 controller to be that good. My jaw dropped.Definitely a must play experience for any PS5 owner. Insanely fun, so much love and attention was clearly put into this game, as it\\'s just bursting at the seams with PlayStation fan service. This made the launch of this console amazing, as it beautifully showcased the power and opportunity the next generation hardware has. Amazing game, with amazing music to boot (that GPU song is just delightful). If you have managed to get a PS5, do yourself a favor and get the platinum in this first!Perfect game to start with, teaches how to use the DualSense controller. Very intuitive, even for a 3 year old to play as his first game ever and easy enough to finish.Astro`s Playromm is an extremely good game, it puts the dual -sensense controller really well in scene, playfully it is mega and the graphic is really very good.\\nI played through the game with a platinum trophy and that alone shows how cool I found this game, I already liked Astro really well in the VR offshoot, but now that there is also a non VR game that is also free on every PS5, should every PS5 owner really play this game, really very well done.\\n-NerdgamingThis incredible, wonderful game is an absolute STEAL considering it comes free with the PS5. A short but sweet platformer that never runs out of creative and innovative ideas. It has some of the best use of the Dualsense 5\\'s powerful features to date. It is filled to the brim with references to characters and hardware throughout Playstation history. Jim and Team Asobi absolutely snapped when they made this one!!Team Asobi has made one of the most underrated and fun platformer games ever! I LOVE ASTRO and love all the DualSense features, all the PS hardware, and game characters! I can\\'t wait to play Team Asobi\\'s next game!Fantastic game showcasing a lot of PS5 and Dual Sense\\'s abilities, recommend to everyone who starts with PS5This game made me laugh out loud so many times. Such a cute game that comes pre-loaded into your PS5! I even got the platinum trophy for it. Short and sweet!Perfect showcase of dualsense, fun platforming, great visuals and fun easter eggsAmazing game that came packaged with PS5 for free. Astro bot is starting to become a PlayStation iconic character!!! 10/10Astro is something extraordinary. I wouldn\\'t analyze it for the game it is, but for what they wanted to show you it gets full marks.\\nAmazing how Dual Sense is exploited and for all the secrets for playstation fans. Absolutely to try.I expected just a short demo of dualsense, and i ended up smiling the entire game. This game is a masterpiece, even just being a \"tech demo\". It feels like a crime to get this game absolutely free!A great platform game, full of innovation and tributes to the history of PlayStation.Love the haptic feedback and adaptive triger dualsense very awesome game 10/10I didn\\'t expect this fun and creativity! A game with diverse, light ideas and pretty memoriesWow, this game out-Nintendos Nintendo. Truly delightful and sometimes quite challenging (at least for me). A joy to play.Easily among the best platform games ever, it rivals mario, banjo and ratchet and clank games and might even succeed them in every way!! Ohh and the soundtrack is fantastic btw.One of my favourite platformers ever! Great showcase for the new Dualsense controller and introduction to the next generation of gaming. Loved every easter egg and the songs were perfect! So catching and fitting for each level. After growing up with the PS1 and owning every Playstation console - it brought back wonderful, nostalgic memories. Incredible game and it\\'s fantastic that it is free so all PS5 owners can enjoy it!! Well done Sony!Amazing game that came packaged with PS5 for free. Astro bot is starting to become a PlayStation iconic character!!! 10/10This Astro game is incredible what a demonstration of technology ! The Dualsense is the best controller ever made for sure ! Thank you SonyI’m not gonna write multiple paragraphs about this, all I’m going to say is everything about this game is absolutely amazing, and it’s on of the best and one of the most fun things I’ve ever played.This game oozes passion and love, passion for a simpler time of gameplay first fun and a love for Playstation History.  It\\'s a 5 hour free love letter to the PlayStation fans. Its criminal that some \\'critics\\' scored it a 7/10. This is a solid game and should not be missed.This is to be a presentation of Sony\\'s new command, but that\\'s not all, a fantastic experience with many mixed feelings: nostalgia, adrenaline, joy, ineffable sensations, from those who play l.… ExpandFantastic platformer with ingenious use of the new technology. Would highly recommend because it is worth the time. (Also free).In the beginning I thought of this game as just a free goodie which would be mediocre but I was so wrong. It is a fantastic game and an excellent tutorial for learning all about the ps5 controller.Best free game after Wii Sports. Truly shows the potential of the PS5 Dualsense controller. Worth getting a PS5 just to play this gameAmazing experience that every PS5 owners should play. I cannot remember the last time I a video game console had a free game installed. This is fitting for the themes of Astro\\'s Playroom, a nostalgia trip of over 25 years of PlayStation and a demo for all the new features of the PS5. A free pack-in game is a new feature by today\\'s standards.\\n\\nThe gameplay in Astro\\'s Playroom is perfect. Astrobot has a laser jump that will float him across gaps and destroy enemies. (Astrobot is a vicious little killing machine.) This makes the platforming rather forgiving, and adept players will be able circumvent obvious routes to speed through areas. Astrobot also has a punch and a charge up spinning attack that is always fun to watch. Some areas have weapons like a bow and arrow or a chain gun.\\n\\nThe world is rich with activity. I truly have fun watching my family navigate this game space. The world is overflowing with little bots who get into trouble, re-enact memorable scenes from PlayStation games, and interact with Astrobot. Few platformers have this kind of attention to detail. The total effect is simply \"wow\".\\n\\nFor people who play inverted like me, you can invert the Y or X access in the PS5\\'s main system menu. I think this option was omitted from Astro\\'s Playroom because Sony wants you to find that system toggle. The game has a functional quality to not only show you the advantages of the DualSense controller, but also the gameplay features. To be fair to Sony, functions such as 3D motion controls and the touch bar were already in the DualShock 4 controller. Game developers really need to start bringing their control schemes to the modern era.\\n\\nThe climbing section of Astro\\'s Playroom is the perfect example of how innovative a game can be. Astrobot climbs into a monkey robot suit (one of 3 robot suits in the game) and has to use a combination of the left and right triggers and the motion controls to climb up a mountain that is studded with handholds and hanging bars. I have never been so taxed to move in a PlayStation game and I loved it. Climbing in games vacillates between a slow moving chore and the game auto-climbing your character up walls while you hold down X. Astrobot\\'s Playroom is the first time I have seen climbing get gamefide.\\n\\nIn addition to being an utter joy to play, Astrobot is also a quick Platifnum trophy for those who care about that kind of thing. I usually have disdain for in-game collectibles though I am a completionist at heart and if the burden of collectibles is not too high, I may go for it. The collectibles in Astro\\'s Playroom fill up a showroom of 5 generations of PlayStation gear surround by giant murals. The number of collectibles is not only management, you have a sense of something to show for your effort.\\n\\nAll-in-all, Astro\\'s Playroom is a must play. When you buy a PS5, you may be excited to get into one of the many AAA games for PS5. Wait on those. Soak in all the goodness of Astro\\'s Playroom first.Astro\\'s Playroom Review: 9.5/10\\nI\\'m giving it almost a 10 for being free and very fun! Glad it comes with the PS5 and showcases beautifully the features and capabilities of the DualSense! I know why the game isn\\'t as long as I would\\'ve wanted but it\\'s understandable. If you get a PS5 play it!It’s an amazing game that fully uses Dualsense capabilities to make an amazing, truly next gen experiencia, I bet everyone that owns a PS5 , and is a PlayStation fan is going to love it, it’s full of Easter egg and collectibles about PlayStation history.It’s the best of its kind',\n",

I\\'m playing on low fidelity due to my pc being a bit of a potato. But it still plays really well and is truly the best vr game I have played to date.… ExpandThe revolution has began. Valve did it with the original Half-Life. Then pushed the limits with Half-Life 2. Now Alyx is here to bring us the future of videogames.\\n\\nBest Half-Life. Best AAA title. Best VR game. I have spoken.Fantastic game! Very scary, very fun, and amazing storytelling.... Can\\'t wait for another... ADDICTEDThe awesome part of Half-Life series! Cool story, gameplay, graphics, characters and optimization.This game is very immersive and interesting, it expands on half life universe, blows away with it\\'s gameplay mechanics, it\\'s definitely one of the best VR games ever made.

It\\'s THE GAME of virtual reality. It\\'s a wonder in every way. This game is taken care of in every tiny detail. The immersion is absolute and after 104 minutes played for now and just getting out of bed I\\'m going to go straight out and keep playing.\\nHalf life Alyx is a gem that has set a standard in gaming and VR since it was released yesterday.\\nGet yourself some VR glasses and try this game you will never regret.Great gameplayGreat story (the story was unpredictable as well)Great endingWell optimized gameGreat graphicsI think the negative review\\'s were becuse of why the game is made for vrDon’t listen to the troll reviews! Valve has worked hard on this game and made it compatible for even the most affordable HMDs. There are more ways to use movement, such as smooth locomotion instead of teleportation. Ladder movement has been fixed! The level design, sound design, graphics and puzzles are phenomenal.Absolutely incredible game, would highly recommend it. Half Life Alyx PROVES VR is NOT a gimmick, it is a full on GAME and it is simply AMAZING. If you don\\'t have VR and you have the money for it get it, it is worth it for the experience. Most of the bad reviews are people that are mad that they don\\'t have VR so don\\'t mind them they are just trying to ruin the score/rating. This is definitely a contender for game of the year and once agian Vavle will most likely revolutionize gaming.It’s really not that Hal-life, that was expected by fans for years. I think it is made for selling Vavle’s versions of VR. After Boneworks it’s no pleasure to play Alyx.Basically this game costs the full price + VR equipment\\'s price. Worth buying VR for playing games ? No.\\nJust buying VR to play 1 game its incredibly stupid thing to do.\\nGame is not that good, i don\\'t get the hype.\\nI repeat, GAME IS NOT THAT GOOD, just OVER HYPED, not worth buying.\\nIts just a VR exclusive made so some waste their money on VR they don\\'t need, i won\\'t be forced to do this just because some smarty-pants wants VR exclusives.\\nGame sucks.They released in essence a full -fledged third part, the events of which are very important for understanding the further plot.And they made it a game for the elect.0 out of 10Tried it over an hour, it\\'s really just a generic FPS with a little more interactivity, I really do think VR is just a gimmick, this was my latest and probably last attempt, tried Boneworks and several other titles before this one, VR really needs to mature a lot before I could recommend it.This game is complete VR garbage. If the developers are going to force people to buy a VR just to play this trash game, the least they could do is make it immersive. It fails to do that with so many invisible walls. The AI in this game is incredibly stupid. The voice acting for the monsters are cringeworthy. Those small jumping monsters don\\'t even sound like monsters, they sound like raccoons growling. The level design is trash and boring. While the graphics are good, the outside environments have horrible lighting effects. The story is awful. The walking is too slow in this game.\\n\\nThere is no multiplayer at all. So once you beat the story, there is not a reason to play this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cashgrab. These greedy developers are asking for too much money for a gimmicky game. I recommend you wait until this game is $5 before picking it up.Garbage story that ruins everything that Half-Life 1 and 2 did, what a disgrace. Also the VR is more of a gimmick than a boon. The gameplay is interesting for 30 minutes but then it becomes very boring, it lacks depth.The most glaring issue is the lack of keyboard and mouse support.  Valve is catering to the 0.1% of Steam users who have VR while forsaking the rest of their customer base (and throwing longtime HL fans under the bus).  With that aside, lets get down to it:\\n\\nLooks pretty, but gameplay consists of fighting the motion controls while moving to the next scripted cutscene.  AI is dumb as rocks with enemies not even noticing your presence as you very loudly grab bullets right behind them.  Shooting them is even funnier, as you get a full ten seconds to empty a mag into them.  Its incredibly slow and BORING.  Nothing entertaining like past entries.\\n\\nThis is not Half Life.  This is a tech demo meant to sell VR hardware.  Where the hell is the Freeman?  Where is Half Life 3?  These 100 score critic reviews are incredibly suspicious and suggests Valve is paying people off to dampen any legit criticism.Uninspired, jaggy, rushed fan service to the most overrated franchise of all time.  LMFAO. critics giving this a 10/10 to justify their $1000 PC VR headset purchase. The game looks like they took 2004\\'s Half Life 2 ... but in VR.Ensure you have a finger tracked setup for this game. Nothing is added by using VR for this game, a bad shot at trying to breathe some life into VR using a beloved franchise.It\\'s an amazing demonstration of what can be done with VR, and it\\'s a good Half Life game - the horror aspect got to the forefront in this one, and it\\'s something Valve really shines at.\\nThe Source 2 in all it\\'s glory is finally being used to the full potential, and it\\'s lighting is so good that it can put Unreal Engine to shame.\\nThe only downside is that this game is clearly made with care for people who are just tipping toes in VR, with slowly ramping combat - at the end of the game it feels like you\\'ve only just reached your combat potential, but then it is over. It makes me wish for a sequel even more.The best game in VR without much of a debate. the only thing it is lacking is melee combat, but it didn\\'t really hurt the experience because of how fun the guns were to use.Honestly, this is the best game you can buy. If you are lucky enough to own a HMD, I urge you to buy this game. I\\'m pretty sure this is a game I can let newcomers play to, given the right comfort settings.And the story, oh boy. You\\'re getting a real treat, as usual with a single player Valve game. This is a great look into how games once where and how they should be.Very good game. Very great interactivity and a lot of player interaction with the world. Good graphics, game design and thoughtfulness.Game changer, it\\'s worth the price.  It\\'s seriously the best game I ever played.Masterpiece, it is definitely revolutionary as all previous deliveries, this time the revolution was the VR as in previous games it was not easyNever seen anything like this before in VR. Its been 4 hours but it felt like 40 minutes.good excellent thanks for your time Glad tiding the sound configuration of dutyValve have always been famous for pushing technical boundaries further in games. The company that made Half Life, Steam, SteamController, Valve index and 2 most popular online games ever now presented a game changing VR game utilizing newest technology and bringing it to masses.\\nTo be honest, I can\\'t recall a non-vr game having such awesome photorealistic graphics. Now seeing such mindblowing level of visual fidelity in VR, the deeply detailed world while having a constant high rate FPS - this shows who is the Boss of video games industry. Not just Vavle is the Boss of All Games being Steam, but they still make killer games at a level that no studio can beat. They have best programmers and artists. Valve produced the best VR game ever existing to date, and made an important contribution in popularizing virtual reality headsets.Games like these are used as benchmarks that will be remember forever. From the story and also from the gameplay point of view, this is amazing.Not only a masterclass in VR world-building, gameplay, and mechanics but a masterclass in narrative storytelling on any platform or medium.This game is truly a masterpiece... I own the Rift for quiet some time now and played a lotof cool shooter games (e.g. Arizona Sunshine) but this game just blew my mind. Stunning graphics and the feeling of the game is just WOW. Everyone giving this game a score lower than 8 is just a troll or is salty because he/she can\\'t afford a VR setup. If you own a compatible VR device, you have to play this game! 12/10, much wow, will blow you away for sure.One of the game changers of the last 10 years. An absolute masterpiece. If this is the tip of the iceberg of the Source2 Engine, I don\\'t know how HL3 could be.The game is simply absorbent, there are no words.It is highly immersive, the scenarios are incredible, the interesting puzzles, the set of the Half Life spectacular universe ...\\nThe only thing missing is the possibility of being able to run ...\\nAnd the only defect of the game, which is over.It cost me 18 hours, because I play without haste, exploring everything well, looking for resources for all drawers.He has details to rage ..\\nI left wanting more.I await a second part or a Half Life 3 with the same quality as this.And of course, in VR.\\nAnd also, an VR version so that I can reach more people, although I suppose that is a lot of work for developers, and I would totally change the concept of the gameIt would be pointless to write another review, as there are already tons out there with WHY the game is so great. I am amazed how Valve manged it to bring HL2 (which I played religiously in 2004 and then HL2:DM for a long time) into 2020...and it doesn\\'t feel dated but all new and exciting again. My Rift was literally collecting dust in its box...and this is finally a game I can\\'t stop playing.\\nEverything, everything about this game is just awesome.\\n\\nTo the people who say that \"they made it only to sell their $1000 index HMD\": Well you can get a used Rift CV1 for €200, less than just an average gamer monitor. Your \"$1000 HMD\" argument doesn\\'t fly anymore.Can\\'t wait for Half-Life Brain interfacing in 13 yearsLoved every second. Going to jump back in to get all the resinthe best thing ever happened to PC gaming\\nBest Half Life game/Best of VR game/Best pc game/\\nJUST THE BEST GAME\\nwhat can be better than this? maybe only something like Sword Art Online in real life?\\n(btw SAO is **** i was just using it as example)Wow! That\\'s the future of gaming! Standing in front of the citadel in City17 and seeing the true size of it in VR is mind blowing! You can use your bare hands to interact with all the objects around you in such a natural way. I was immediately IN THIS WORLD. You\\'ll forget your real space, but beware of the walls in your room :). There is so much attention to every detail paired with great storytelling.\\n\\nIt\\'s so intense! Half Life reached the next level with VR. If you never played in VR, give it a try and do it slowly because Alyx is so immersive you can have some problems as beginner. Especially movement should be set to teleport for beginners to avoid instant motion sickness, veterans use smooth locomotion and have the best experience of their VR life!\\n\\nLove it!We waited for the game for 13 years, passed the game in YouTube, a great game!Now there is this thing called being jealous. That is certainly how some people reacted to the game coming out and not being able to play it because they do not own or want the required hardware. I wonder if they have the same reaction to games coming out to consoles etc. that they do not own. Or maybe they just want endless iterations of the game they have played already. Ah well, I\\'d recommend this game in particular on the simple fact that it is finally pushing a reemerged technology forward into gaming.Valve did a new revolution ı think. They did two revolution in 1998 and 2004 and now they did another. VR can be the future for gamers. I was not thinking that before playing half life alyx but everything has changed after this game. This is amazing. I cant tell it with words. İt is perfect .Half Life is back.\\n\\nMake no mistake, this is not Half Life 3, but it is a full-fledged Half Life game, a wonderful addition to the series, and pushes the boundaries of gaming\\'s newest frontier like all major Half Life games should.\\n\\nSome experienced VR users have expressed frustration with some features that Alyx is missing compared to other VR games like H3 and Boneworks. These critiques are valid, but my theory is that this is because Valve has included only the most polished VR interactions and features that they could. It is a solid title for both those new to VR, as well as people who have been escaping meatspace since 2016 or even earlier.\\n\\nIf you bought a VR headset for this game and are finished with it, don\\'t put that headset away yet, this isn\\'t all VR has to offer. If you want more Half-Life in VR just on an indie budget, pick up Boneworks. If you want more physics-based combat, pick up Blade & Sorcery or GORN. If you want even more intricate and wonderful gunplay, pick up Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, & Hand Grenades. If now you\\'re thinking you\\'d like to try Counter-Strike in VR, pick up Pavlov. If you want another linear semi-horror, single-player VR FPS, pick up Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. If you want something completely different, you can\\'t go wrong with Beat Saber.\\n\\nMany people have already proclaimed Half Life: Alyx to be VRs \"killer app\" and that argument certainly has merit, but don\\'t let that trick you into thinking it\\'s all there is worth playing.holy **** a must play game! if you haven\\'t gotten a VR yet, NOW IS THE TIME.This game is mind blowing. Absolute fantastic experience so far. It is incredible how immersive this game is. There are so many great details to discover and the atmosphere is really terrific.\\n\\nYou should not expect the freedom and sandbox physics like it is in Boneworks. But in return this game so much less clunky and feels so much more polished. Instead of a sandbox you get a theme park game. And its the best theme park I have every experienced.\\n\\nOne further comment to movement options: This game is clearly designed to be used with teleportation/dash movement and not for free locomotion. I always though that free locomotion would bring the best immersive feeling, but I changed my opinion completely. I think that the dash movement is much less immersion breaking than the free locomotion option.\\n\\nThe reason is simple: When freely moving with a thump-stick you are moving all the time, even for small distances as it is the most convenient way (humans are lazy). But this means that you are all the time disconnected from your real movement and it feels more like sitting in a cockpit.\\n\\nIn the dash mode however, it is easier to just walk one step in your play area if an object (for example a door) is close enough. So I really get around in my play area a lot and it feels like I am really there. Of course to move greater distances you need to dash, but I think it feels really good and immersive because the audio effects are so great that it kind of feels as if you are moving there.\\n\\nSurely, from time to time, you get too close to the boundary of your play area and then you need to step back and dash forward, but for me this is way less immersion breaking than moving all the time independent of your body, since in total you have much more time to be completely immersed in the game.\\n\\nAlso I think it is better to disabled snap turning as you are more immersed in the game if you turn manually in real life (you need cable management though.)People who dislike this game because it\\'s VR only are pathetic and disgusting. You known there once were only 2D games, and buying the first 3d accelerator card for my PC in the 90s was hella expensive. That was no reason to hate on the up and coming 3D games.\\n\\nIdiots somehow have 1300$ for a phone that they use to browse 9gag, but when an emerging technology comes along that promises new ways to play, they are suddenly all out of mere 400$.Valve shows once again that they are the kings of video game innovation.\\n\\nAt first i was curious how this would compare to Boneworks, a Half-life inspired game in VR that is truly groundbreaking in how it handles realism and physics. However Boneworks starts to show fairly early on the limitations of full physics simulation when precision can be unforgiving and dissonance between real life and virtual can create some really awkward jank.\\n\\nThis is where Valve flex their masterful AAA muscles and experience. They have struck that perfect balance between realistic physics, world agency, but also making if feel fluid, seamless and deliberate.They have pushed the boundaries of VR and made the first truly killer app that has the titanic weight of the Half-Life IP behind it. This is where Valve and Half-Life truly belongs, at the frontier of gameplay innovation.It goes beyond my high expectation.\\nA new step for video games.\\nUnbelievable !!Simply the best, hand crafted while still being meaty with content. Nothing close to this with VR, a must play for VROne of the best video games to this day and age!I jumped in with unrealistic expectations because it\\'s the first half life game in 12 years but it somehow managed to surpass those expectations.It\\'s worth buying a headset just to play itI waited 7-8 years, and i can say............This amazing!!////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////.//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////The best VR game of all time and one of the best games this year. Not to even mention that it brings back one of the best game series back from the dead.Lovelovelovlovlovlovlovl OveovlovlovlvrulrodlvrulGorGotoAn incredible addition to the Half-Life series. Iy has absolutely everything you would hope for and more from a new Half-Life title. By far the best VR experience out there right now. Beautiful graphics, amazing story and dialogue, and the atmosphere is perfect. Headcrabs, zombies, and barnacles are all so much more creepy than ever before, and the sound design is absolutely superb. This is a perfect game in every way. The only way it could have been better is if it never ended.This game is just amazing.  The world is so detailed, when I take the headset off, I get confused whether I am in VR a bit.  I can\\'t believe it works so well on my middling hardware.  Best game in VR, along with Lone Echo.Wow, I just finished. I can\\'t believe that not only is there a new Half-Life game, but it\\'s in VR and 100% lives up to the quality of HL1 and HL2. This is without a doubt the best VR game ever made. It\\'s also one of the best looking games I have ever played (sometimes I would pick up a clock or a hotel card, hold it up to my face, and fail to find any \"tells\" that I was looking at a digital rendering and not a real object) and a wonderful example of thrilling game design.\\n\\nAny concerns I initially had about there being too much humor faded after I realized I was playing a pretty scary horror game and that the humor is just there to keep things from getting unbearably bleak. The writing is sharp, the acting is fantastic, and Valve keeps each new area full of interesting surprises.\\n\\nCombat is surprisingly challenging. There are a lot of things to juggle, between keeping your guns loaded and accessing you inventory mid-combat while not getting mowed down instantly. Alyx is not Gordon Freeman and does not have a magical bullet suit, so she dies very quickly if you don\\'t retreat or stay in cover.\\n\\nThe level of immersion is off the charts, even for a VR game, in part because of the absolutely gorgeous Source 2 engine and Valve\\'s top-tier art team and level designers. There is also plenty here for Half-Life fans to enjoy, with familiar characters, enemies, and weapons making appearances.\\n\\nAlso, the gravity gloves are brilliantly implemented, and strike the perfect balance between utility and being overpowered. They are not the gravity gun, and you will not be mowing down fools by hitting them with a cinder block at Mach 3. They\\'re more for grabbing distant items and to keep you from having to bend over all the time to pick things up.\\n\\nAll in all, I couldn\\'t be happier with this purchase. Valve did it.This games consolidates all of the best VR practices we\\'ve seen in the best VR games in the past 2 years to create a solid VR experience.\\nNot even mentioning that it\\'s Half-life, it\\'s a solid game on its own regardless of platform. the story, characters and dialog are amazing as we\\'ve come to expect from Valve.\\n\\nMany people back in the day would\\'ve complained too that their 486 based pc couldn\\'t run the original Half-Life, that 3d was a gimmick, why buy a graphics card?, many people could\\'ve complained that the physics in Half-Life 2 are just a gimmick, that they don\\'t add anything to the game, and many people will complain now that VR is just a gimmick. Do not listen to these people.This is THE defining FPS adventure we have been waiting for in VR. Highly detailed, incredible story, incredible sound design. One heck of a game VR or not ! Absolute masterpiece of a game. This is my first Metarcritic review - But I had to get it out. INCREDIBLE game ! Plays flawless on the Rift S -Greatest VR Game ever made, one of the best first person shooters of all time.As a diehard Half-life fan, I am overwhelmingly happy this game got made. The ending is so special.Thank you, ValveNo wonder I bought BP!Graphics - amazing!GIIMPLY - varied!Optimization - fireThis game is incredible. Truly a good vr game. It was well worth the wait..Excellent immersion in a rich familiar world. Seeing a Vortigaunt in front of me adds something that pancake gaming just can\\'t provide. Worth the wait!Absolutely amazing! Valve is once again changing the way people play games and while many people are upset now, it wont be long before VR is going to be the way to go.Thanks Valve you have given us what we were waiting for, I hope the 3. Glory to Mr. GabenThe best VR experience i ever had, nice job Valve!.\\n\\nDon´t listen to the trolls, who gave this game a bad voting. This right here is a masterpiece!Don\\'t listen to the flatties trying to troll on this game.\\nIf you play this game, you would not be able to give it a bad score.\\n\\nI cannot praise this game enough.\\nAs an avid fan of VR as a platform, this is exactly the push we needed to show to the world VR is ready!\\nHalf-Life: Alyx is doing a massive service (and sure, making a tasty profit, not the point though) to the tech world by putting VR in the spotlight once more. Valve don\\'t just stop there however. At the same time they are contributing to the arts and nacent XR development industry, raising the bar on input language, immersive narrative through entity interactions, and just such a satisfying, solid, and unique gaming experience.\\n\\nAs a VR developer myself, it\\'s hard to overstate the importance of this game to the industry. Surely a water-shed moment for tech at large.I\\'ve been a hesitant fan of VR for the better part of the past year ever since I tried out RE7 on PSVR. Despite the limitations I was really impressed and saw great potential in VR as not necessarily \"the future\" of gaming, but certainly as a very strong and viable alternative to flat-screen gaming. My only gripe at that point was the lack of titles available in VR.\\n\\nValve has always been at the forefront of the industry pushing new technology down consumer\\'s throats until they conform, and in retrospect we find that it\\'s usually for the better. Innovation is nothing to belittle and there is so much of it in Half Life: Alyx. As a game, it\\'s also quite excellent. The aesthetic is pleasingly dark and they push horror-esque scenes throughout the game to better effect than actual horror games. The UI is intuitive and throwing grenades or pulling things in with your gravity gloves works like a charm. The music is very fitting in all situations, and definitely adds a lot to the game. Not forgettable at all. The first time you go up against Combine soldiers and the music from the trailer kicks on, it feels great. Additionally, Valve has promised 3 more AAA VR titles in the coming years and so it\\'s looking like my gripe about there  being no titles is about to be addressed.\\n\\nHaving said that the game doesn\\'t come without a few downsides that I hope will be addressed.\\n\\n- No run feature in smooth locomotion mode\\n- Sometimes the physics engine messes up a bit. Haven\\'t had anything game breaking\\n- When I started the game the first time, there was an audio issue where any action performed by characters was not heard, but ambient noises and music could be. A restart fixed it and I haven\\'t had a similar problem since, though.\\n- Not enough crowbar\\n\\nBut all in all this is a wonderful title. If you can, get yourself some knuckles controllers for this game because they work infinitely better than the alternatives, and obviously better headsets will make the game more enjoyable.\\n\\nAs a sidenote, I\\'ve only completed about half of the game so far but if anything serious changes my opinion about it as the game progresses I\\'ll rewrite my review and reassess the score I gave it.Absolute terrific delivery from Valve. Graphics are really good and balanced, physics top notch and the story of half-life is unraveled deeper. Even on a cheap WMR headset you can really enjoy this masterpiece.\\nCould not recommend more.The best VR game to date and a worthy Half-Life game. Waited 12 years and did not get disapointed. Graphics, gameplay, sound, storytelling is just a joy. Also the best left hand support in vr.It is a fucking wonder, see that I had high expectations but PFFFF has surpassed them, and the optimization is brutal, even with a GTX 1650 you can play.Played the whole game, took about 12 hours to complete. In terms of gameplay it\\'s not going to blow your mind but it\\'s not intended to. It feels incredibly natural, what you think should happen will usually happen. Make sure you avoid spoilers because the game has a great story which you will want to earn. I see a lot of people saying the game is disappointing compared to Boneworks but everything I disliked about Boneworks wasn\\'t in this game. Platforming in Boneworks was irritating. The thumbstick movement in Boneworks made me feel really sick but with Alyx I didn\\'t feel anything with the blink motion enabled. The action with guns felt incredibly similar but Half Life had the added great scripting of the enemies and each big fight felt like you were fighting for your life.\\n\\nThe short review is it\\'s amazing and it is an instant VR classic.\\n\\nNotes for people who are on the fence:\\n\\n1. You don\\'t need to buy the Valve Index\\n2. It\\'s a prequel but it definitely adds to the story of the original games\\n3. It isn\\'t Half Life 3 but uses the Half Life universe correctly and treats the lore well\\n4. The game really wouldn\\'t be the same with a mouse and keyboard, people will complain but the game would be so easy with a mouse a keyboard but the added complexity of VR IS the game.\\n5. If you are interested in VR and just are waiting for an opportunity this is definitely the opportunity but if you aren\\'t interested that is fine\\n6. There is no need to spam 0/10 ratings on a game you never playedWhat you dream every VR game was. Lives up to its expectations. I\\'d wait another 13 years for another game like thisReally top -end game for VR.Atmospheric, interestingly, addictive.Expectations were justified, the game is just something.People Who Complain Is Base The Haven\\'t Tried It.Total Feeling of Being in City 17 and the Half-Life Atmosphere.Amazing Second By Second.Overwhelming Enjoyment for Saga Lovers.\\nGreat Story and Content.\\nMasterpiece: The Best Game for Br and Pc/Console.Essential.\\n\\nThe people who complain is because they have not tried it.Total sensation of being in city 17 and in the Half-Life atmosphere.Amazing second to second.A brutal enjoyment for saga lovers.\\nGreat history and content.\\nMasterpiece: The best game of both VR and PC or console.Essential.\\n\\nThe grapes are not green, fortunately.Just finished the story line. Half Life Alyx is the culmination of the entire history of video games. Not just of virtual reality. The mechanics. The graphics. The immersion. The art. Absolutely a pleasure.What can I say – this game is amazing. I clearly remember the moment when I put on my glasses run the game and saw myself in the middle of City17 with the citadel in front of me – this was indescribable feeling. You know what? This feeling is with you whole the time. I take my hat off to Valve, they did it again – they show a new direction for whole game industries. It\\'s amazing step, and I hope that Valve make HL3 in the same way.\\nBest game experience for years. Even now when I relay this words I have goosebumps just thinking about it :-)Best VR game ever (the gravity gloves are AWESOME!). I highly recommend you get it, it\\'s perfect for Half-Life fans and PCVR owners.This cannot be stressed enough, the atmosphere and immersion in this game are like nothing else. it\\'s a bloody masterpiece. Every step of the way (even the slowest moments) have your attention. Then there is the story... omg, if you\\'re a HL fan you will LOVE it, if you\\'re not, you should be.This is the best VR game of my life and one of the best gaming experiences ever. Hoping they will continue it in the coming years and not decades :)I think this is the best VR game to date and might even qualify as the \"must have\" vr title. It\\'s quite immersive and the physics aspect is just great. I\\'m playing with a pimax headset and the immersion the combination gets is just amazing.Absolutely amazing! First game in VR that is not just a gimmick but is actually a proper game great gameplay and storyline. The visuals are best I have seen on VR so far.game of the eon hands down. Valve did it again, and I hope they actually make more this timeThis is Great, Keep Calm and Wait HL3, and G-Man = Lox, Caroche HL: Alix turned out to be really suitable, the ending simply blew up my brain, looking at the ending, I realized that there will be Half-Life 3, there was patience.It is not HL³ but it is a preparation for it!\\n\\nThe ending worth the entire game.This is maybe the best game I\\'ve ever played. Valve is finally back with Half-LifeThis game is a real masterpiece! The best game I have payer in my entire life ! It blown me away from start to finish!Half-Life: ALYX is one of the best games I\\'ve ever played on any platform, and certainly the best VR game I\\'ve ever played. You might notice that the reviews are either 10/10 or 0/10 and the only people rating it 0/10 didn\\'t actually play the game. It has a few minor flaws such as so-so melee, but the full package makes up for it and then some. The guns feel satisfying to use. The locomotion is polished and a joy to use, even on Vive touchpads. The graphics are not as good as some other AAA flatscreen games, but it still looks fantastic. This is done because VR needs high framerates and high resolutions to look even ok.\\n\\nI won\\'t spoil anything, but the game is worth it for the ending alone.This game is very exciting and interesting, it expands the Half-Life universe, amazes with its mechanics of gameplay, this is definitely one of the best VR games ever created.I don’t understand why people who do not have virtual reality and who have never played the game can watch it.The game offers a whole new experience and opens the doors for VR. Being the biggest vr investment yet, it is absolutely worth the wait, as you go deep in city 17 or when you meet the briefcase guy who makes that deal. The game is so detailed and the best experience you can possibly have on vr, despite that the game only has 3 weapons, the upgrades system is pretty well made as it rewards players for exploring specially that all the upgrades are useful at some point and will not let your gun down anytime soon.… ExpandAmazing. Everything is perfect. I was expecting good game but this is holy grail!!!This is from far the best VR game that I ever played.  the storyline is excellent and you feel completely immersed as soon as you put your headset on. I recommend it for anybody who is thinking about getting it you will not be disappointed. VR is the future and I\\'m happy to be part of it. Thanks  again valve for this masterpeice.Best game ever i m just sad that it didn\\'t last for ever hopefully we get new one soomNext level Experience in Gaming. Similar to the step from  2D to 3D. It is an unbelievable joy to hold the gun and tools in your hand.Score is 10, The quality of this product is outstanding. The best VR game I have ever played. Well done Valve. Pure Art!!!\\nThe sound and env, story, graphics I just cant explain, it feels like you are inside the HL universe. really it feels like you are inside CITY 17.\\n\\nBelieve me. VR is the future if all games as quality as HLA.crown and it was disgusting that I i me i I will have to sideload me to theThe closest thing to taste a good reserve wine. Of those that you cannot taste daily and leave a pleasure that has nothing to do with the other more mundane wines.\\n17 years have passed without knowing anything about the universe of Gordon Freeman and the world of Half Life 2 ... But what returns! Valve, the developer, has not only put the saga at the height of excellence. This Half Life Aryx has entered as an elephant in a traditional Gamer world pot and thanks to the VR experience has raised the interactive entertainment formula when nobody expected it.\\nSlip, foolish. Volad to some oculus, some live or the Index de Valve if you have the budget ... and play the best game of the decade. The one that marks a point of non -return, which has put on its own merits, to the rest of the developers as small studies in a periquete.\\nWhat I have lived cannot be expressed with words. You have to try it and touch, look, astonish, freak out and cry with emotion ...\\nA must play of the decade.Valve 1998: \"this is how FPS games should look like\"...\\nValve 2004: \"This is how physics in games should work\"....\\nValve 2020: \" This is how VR games should be played\"  ...\\n\\nVALVE DID IT AGAIN !!!!   Even after 13 years of inactivity in Half-Life world, they put the bar too high, this time in VR world.  No words, amazing masterpiece and jewelery among VR games.  We want more !!!!Ignore the 0\\'s from all the people that haven\\'t even played the game.  It is RIDICULOUSLY good!  I wish Metacritic had a way to wean out these sub-humans that just give the game a o for absolutely no good reason.Valve somehow could repeat the same effect as it was in 1998 and 2004. Though it isn\\'t packed with all possible physical VR interactions (like boneworks does) it is much more comfortable and interesting to play. So I could say it is The First full length single player AAA VR game. It is not a VR demo or some physics sandbox. It is big solid experience. And it is Awesome! Bravo, Valve!GREAT GAME!!! This game would make me buy a VR headset. It is so cool to be immersed in the Half-Life world. This game has fun, new, innovative gameplay.',\n",
       " 'Honestly I\\'ve played a LOT since Shadowbringers has released (pre release on 28th) and I\\'ve finished all the MSQ (Main Story Quests) and It\\'s been a hell of a ride. Voice acting and story line are ON POINT!!!\\n\\nOn release there are 8 dungeons and 2 big boss \"Trials\" as well as 2 lesser Big Boss Trials included with the expansion as well as 5 zones you can obtain flying in right away (Not wait 7 months and have to do a buncha BS, looking @ You WoW)\\n\\nAlso with Shadowbringers it brought a complete revamp to the games combat system and healing system. It made all the jobs (Classes) WAY more fun to play which is awesome. Looking more and more like a fast action MMORPG.\\n\\nEach zone ingame is gorgeous in Shadowbringers, all the music is amazing, the game is more fun to play than ever and jobs are more balanced. What more could you ask for to be honest.\\n\\nSo some people give low scores it seems because it\\'s expensive because they have to buy initial game plus this expansion. Other games make you buy initial, prior expansions and then current expansion.\\n\\nAt least FFXIV Lets you buy Game + All prior expansions for one low price and then allows you to buy current expansion when you get to it.Shadowbringers is, in my experience, without a doubt the greatest multiplayer story ever told through a game.I\\'ve played many Final Fantasy games, but Shadowbringers is my favourite of all. It puts forth the greatest depth accompanied by dark, interesting themes, that are tackled with an expert finesse. Like it\\'s predecessors, Shadowbringers is truly a game upon itself rather than a simple expansion.A story that deserves to be experienced by all, but unfortunately may only be experienced by few, as it is necessary to work your way through the other fantastic FFXIV expansions before arriving at Shadowbringers. Shadowbringers is a masterpiece that brings a level of worldbuilding that is a rarity in JRPGs, and unrivaled in the MMORPG genre.Amazing story. Graphics has a great emphasis on attention to detail from scenery to character.Hello, I\\'m absolutly not a paid corporate shill and this is my unbiased Review for SHADOWBRINGERS\\n\\nSHADOWBRINGERS is a masterpiece of video game narrative. Nothing else even comes close. The story is brutal, challenging, bold, and almost never \"fun\". It is harrowing, forcing the player to confront violence in a way video games never do. In a medium where everything is John Wick, SHADOWBRINGERS is Schindler\\'s List.\\n\\nAnd just like that film, there were times when I wasn\\'t sure I could keep going. It is a relentless emotional assault that I suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. The game is a work of art - every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. Visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. It is astounding. And frequently beautiful.\\n\\nWith moments you NEVER find in video games.  But I cannot overstate how harrowing it is. It feels like 2 seasons of the darkest TV show you\\'ll ever find, and it frequently better than most TV on the air.  That\\'s saying a lot.  I think it is an IMPORTANT game. It tore me up, and I will never, ever forget SHADOWBRINGERS is a game that will change you.\\n\\nIn short, SHADOWBRINGERS put me through hell.  I did not enjoy it.  I wasn\\'t supposed to.  I was affected by it.  Like no game before.  I am in awe of it.  I am recovering from it.The story continues and builds on one started almost a decade ago, and it is amazing. Fantastic game with so much care put into it, beautiful for its age, god tier music, the most chill and friendly community I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\nThis is the best mmo of all time, and this is their best xpac yet. Can\\'t wait to see the conclusion of the story arc that started with 1.0 to end in Endwalker, and definitely can\\'t wait to see what the next arc will be.This is possibly the best Final Fantasy in the series... and it\\'s an MMO on top of that.\\nThe systems they use are perfected. They don\\'t change very much, but that\\'s because they\\'re done so well. All they do is add more and more content to do and more classes to play.\\n\\nThe music is 11/10 as well.Shadowbringers is an amazing expansion with an excellent story, amazing soundtrack and some really nice environments.\\nWith FF14 plus it\\'s expansions and FF7R, final fantasy seems to be getting back on track. The future of the franchise looks promising. The next expansion to FF14 will no doubt be great.In 2021 I started playing from ARR to Shadowbringers and I am blown away that a 10/10 game could get better. 100/10 easilyThe Shadowbringers expansion is the pinnacle in Final Fantasy series, while the early game can turn some people a way but the overall gameplay is only getting better and better over time.Having played FFXIV actively for two years now, I can honestly say it is one of the best video game experiences I have had the pleasure of playing. Shadowbringers is the highlight of the journey, bringing a story that made me cry more times than every other game combined. If you enjoy a good fantasy story, you can\\'t go wrong with Final Fantasy XIV. Every expansion is like a new book or a season of a fantasy series, and Shadowbringers is where the game rewards you for the investment of getting so far.Fantastic game with a really nice and welcoming community. I was baffled by all the things you can do in this game.\\nEspecially the healthy faction system and the player housing was a breath of fresh air for someone coming from wow with it\\'s toxic faction system, that is reflected in the toxic behavior of wow players. Not all of them of course. Many are just tired and frustrated by it but aren\\'t toxic. So yeah, it\\'s nice to see that Square Enix is managing their factions and the community in such a healthy way.\\nFF XIV is great!Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers isn\\'t just a good MMO expansion. It\\'s by far the best Final Fantasy game I\\'ve ever played. The combat system has been refined and retooled to be more intuitive with less unfun mechanics bogging it down, such as the removal of the ammo and heat systems from Machinist. The story in Shadowbringers is far and away one of the best RPG stories in years and is full of twists and turns that challenge your preconceptions of the rules of the world as well as the morality of your struggle. Masayoshi Soken has also blown us away yet again with his OST, managing to implement all manner of musical genre into an ever-evolving game. Shadowbringers is more than worth your time, and I strongly urge new players to progress through the game normally rather than buy skips to jump straight to the endgame. Endgame isn\\'t everything in XIV and the story loses a lot of meaningful impact by skipping it.Amazing new DLC! New classes, new Music, new location. Amazing story. Recommended!Perfection! I\\'ve played mmo\\'s since the early days when Ultima Online existed and have to say that Shadowbringers is the first in a long time to make me feel so engaged with the story. final fantasy XIV is known for it\\'s impressive storytelling, but Shadowbringers takes it to another level. On a MMO stand point it\\'s perfection.... equally you could call this an amazing RPG.\\nThe additions of the Trust system and other quality of life changes, really just polish the diamond this expansion already was.I made an account this to rate this. This game left me feeling empty and sad in the way only truly amazing stories can. The characters are so incredibly written and voiced. The antagonist is beautifully crafted. The cutscene are animated perfectly to fit the scenes. This game made me connect so much even just with my own character. It\\'s truly a masterpiece. I almost wish this wasnt an MMO, because anyone who doesn\\'t play ffxiv will miss out on this, and that\\'s genuinely upsetting.The story of the new Addon is better than the most AAA single player game stories.Aviot is incorrect on the yen price to get into the game,  its actually ¥6576 / 59.99 (expac + base) for a new player\\nand ¥ 4200 / $40  for a veteran player.  you wont find another mmo like this,  it transcends the wow clone stereotype.The best Final Fantasy experience in over a decade. FFXIV has always been good but Shadowbringers just pushes it over the edge.In an age where the MMO genre seems to be dying off, Shadowbringers emerges to show that MMO\\'s are still alive and kicking. A story that grips you as soon as you jump into it. Environments and music that will leave you breathless. Truly, Yoshi-P and all of SE should be proud of this as they have done a phenomenal job.Shadowbringers is the best mmorpg expansion that we\\'ve seen in many many years. SE knocked it out of the park with this one.FF XIV becomes greater and greater. Great scenario, great antagonist(whom i used to compete a lot). Antagonist deserves a lot of good words in his address. His story, his character it\\'s all so great. And last part of scenario is breathtaking. What more can i say? - Music. Soken is genius, and music in this expanshion says th same. Design of location worse than in Stormblood, but still good. But design of last scenario dungeon is something amazing. About gameplay... I very like rebalance of classes. Trust system is best that they can do - NPC deal good dps, evade AoE and boss mechanics, (Urianger - best healer) and no awaitng in queue for dps, it\\'s good step. So i receive many positive emotions through playing this expansion. Thanks to Yoshida, Soken and other creators of this masterpiece. Looking for new scenario patches.All I can say is the story is insanely good and keeps me reeling in the entire time. The dungeons are super high budget and the world environment is gorgeous. Note that to get to Shadowbringers you must complete the previous expansions.Not the most noob friendly game out there. But once get over the steep learning curve, this becomes a legendary MMO!Just finished the Main Story. This is by far the best MMO Expansion I\\'ve ever played. The music is fantastic, the QoL changes are extremely good, and the story blows many other non-mmo Final Fantasies out of the water.I haven\\'t felt as exicited playing an MMO since I was a child. City\\'s actually feel like they are cities and not just a warehouse with vendors. Music is so good I could just listen to it all day., Almost all of the main story is voiced beautifully, and the story itself just drags you in and keeps you there. I normally skip stories and only play for endgame, but this expansion\\'s was just too goodOne of the greatest stories ever told in Final Fantasy franchise and one of the best mmo expansions ever released. True masterpiece.Played this expansion\\'s story from start to finish.\\n\\nOne of if not the best story I have played in my 14yrs of playing mmos. So many plot twist, raw emotions, and just masterful writing in part of the story writers. Tons of voiced cut scenes. You even begin to question yourself if the main villains are actually bad and second guess if what you are doing is even right in the first place. This expansion ties the game into all the expansions before it filling in many of the small questions hinted in the dialog and cut scenes of A Ream Reborn, Heavensward, and Storm Blood.\\n\\nThe sound track for this expansion is stellar, with the exception of the open world battle music in my opinion had to turn that off in the settings. But everything else just fits so well. I found myself literally just listening to the field music in several of the zones and the final battle zone for 30+mins while I did stuff around the house the other day.\\n\\nWorld design they take us to another shard, parallel universe, where the world developed completely differently. You can tell where you are in game but it is done where they really did not borrow any assets from the old Eorzea world. It is masterfully done. Some parts of the world even change as you progress through the story.\\n\\nNegative parts of this expansion are somewhat hard to find, it is very polished but here are a few in my opinion.\\n\\nYou have to do everything else before it or pay to skip to this. So as a new player you have 50ish hours of work to get to this expansion, or drop money in the cashshop. (You will be sorta lost in the story if you do though.)\\n\\nThere are points where you need to level up outside progressing the story. While not bad with what the game give you it sucked to have to take a 1-2hr breaks right as you are getting into the story to continue it. This is standard for a mmo though.\\n\\nThe server issues on certain worlds, while no where near as bad ARR,HW, and Stormblood. Disconnects and ques are up drastically. To note this is common in any major mmo and always resolves itself as the expansion launch gets farther away. This basically means a lot of ppl are playing.\\n\\nExtremely long ques for tanks and dps classes due to shortage of healers. Without the launch of a new healer job this expansion there is an extreme imbalance of jobs in the instance que system. You can expect up to 30min waits as tank and dps. Healers insta get into groups for literally everything.\\n\\nOverall this is one of the single best expansions ever released in any mmo period. I highly suggest purchasing it even if only to play through the story it is that good.I\\'ve finished the main story and have played this pretty much all day every day since the Early Access released. I can honestly say this is peak story telling in a video game. This expansion is the result of a stroke of genius. From beginning to end the entire story was engaging, the characters are all interesting and the main antagonist is as charismatic as a character could possibly ever be. The story is full of mysteries and secrets and it\\'s also very lore intense for those who care about that. Gameplay wise, the dungeons are a lot of fun, boss mechanics are as engaging as ever and I absolutely love my job\\'s new skills.\\n\\nI can\\'t in good conscience give it any other score. If I had to think of a negative, it would be that they set the bar too high with this expansion. I\\'m not sure they\\'ll be able to ever beat it.Absolute phenomenal story telling, best expansion story line yet. Would highly recommend to anyone on the fence.Best expansion yet, square enix really outdid themselves, amazing story, soundtrack, locations.Holy... this is how a expansion to a game should be, Shadowbringers puts other Mmo\\'s to shame with it\\'s otherworldy soundtrack and a Story better than most tripel A games provide. THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR FF14 PLAYERS !I am not the type of person who typically writes reviews, but I truly felt like this experience deserved one.  This is one of the best stories, so far, that I have ever played in a game.  I am putting this on par with AAA single player games as well.  This expansion, all by itself, stands on its own but with the foundations set by the past 5 years, it is even better.  The music is some of the best I have heard in a video game.  The story is amazing and well written.  It is like finding a good book that you just can\\'t put down.  The world is absolutely gorgeous and filled with life and adventure.  The player base is amazing.Koji and YoshiP really did go all out here. Other companies should take noteBest expansion of the game so far and probably the best overall expansion to a MMO in general of all those that i have played. Story was excellent and kept me wanting to know what happens next. It was also accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack. This is for sure one of if not the best MMO out there now.If you\\'ve reached Shadowbringers you\\'ve already invested a lot of time into the characters, but this is where a lot of that investment will pay off. Shadowbringers pulls on countless threads that have been woven into the world of Final Fantasy XIV and tightens the lore into a more cohesive whole than it\\'s ever been, and for me that\\'s where the biggest moments in Shadowbringers have come from. For all the time I spent attending Fan Fests or watching them in the middle of the night or sitting through translated live letters and parsing each word of interviews and press releases, I was still surprised by so many elements of the plot and the final acts left me simultaneously in awe and terror at the events that were unfolding in front of me, so masterfully brought back to life by Naoki Yoshida and his team. This was a story to rival the best in the Final Fantasy series for sure.I\\'ve been a fan of Final Fantasy 14 since day one but this expansion has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had in a game.As a long time WoW fanboy, all I can say is that Shadowbringers sets a new bar for the MMO Genre.\\n\\nWoW really has some work to be done to rise to the level of Shadowbringers.Shadowbringers is one of the best expansions for Final Fantasy XIV. The Campaign storyline, although it can feel lengthy, delivers a great villain with understandable motivations and explores its new setting very well. A great improvement over Stormblood\\'s Zenos, which felt like a one dimensional fighting machine written by a Deviart fanfic artist.\\n\\nMost of the jobs were revamped and useless skills were removed from the game without making each lose it\\'s identity from one another, although some might feel it\\'s way too simplified now.\\n\\nThe music for this expansion is phenomenal and the soundtrack can be enjoyed even out of the game, The graphic and environment also looks superb and each zone is vastly different from one another.This is a really amazing expansion, to the story,characters, places, maps scenery, music, all so amazing, well worth the money and worth it, wont be dissapointedWithout a doubt, one of the best MMORPG overcoming the former, Wow, I recommend itShadowbringers has an MSQ I want to relive countless times. I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I questioned and reveled in each passing scene. I played solo, I played with friends, I took every opportunity I could to participate in all I came across and am still adoring in exploration.\\n\\nWe\\'ve come so far since our earliest days in the Waking Sands, and I\\'ll be damned if the game hasn\\'t as well. The voice acting, this expansion, was truly magnificent. Even side characters and NPCs had rich, expressive voice work that surprised and delighted each and every time I came across it. The sound track is incredibly immersive - Soken really went above and beyond to bring this situations, these locations and this story to life.\\n\\nThough it\\'s hard to put into words, Shadowbringers, has a \\'classic\\' fantasy feel though never once lacks for pacing. The storytelling speaks to the soul on a whole new level and come it\\'s conclusion I felt the need to take a breath and processed all I\\'d witnessed; satisfied and emptied, both, with a strong desire to revisit past scenes with a different take. In an attempt to avoid spoilers, I\\'ll not go into detail but the final \\'zone\\' leading up to it\\'s end was incredibly impactful - to feel a sense of nostalgia and sadness bordering on the personal for a place never before visited is uncanny, and it\\'s the truest expression I found to describe 5.0.\\n\\nFor anyone out there thinking of giving it a go, don\\'t hold back.\\n\\nMy opinion is that of one voice among millions, but simply said: Thank you. Thank you, Yoshi-P and the SE team for all the time and effort, the thoughtfulness and the passion you bring to game development and the world of Final Fantasy.Great Ff game. Recommend. Best since X. Squaresoft level. Great story. Music. Best MMO.Great great great. Squaresoft level. Very good. Best MMO out there. Recommend to everyone. Amazing game.Shadowbringers shows that it is possible to have an amazing story in a MMO. Not only does this expansion excel in storytelling but it takes Final Fantasy into a whole new direction.This mmo is amazing, best main story, best soundtrack, best combat system (old shcool), best dungeon and raid mechanics. The game runs flawlessly on my 1080 Ti and 8700k at max setting at 1440p.\\ngreat work optimizing it, thank you Yoshida san.The best Final Fantasy XIV expansion so far. An amazing and emotional story that I won\\'t forget.One of the best MMO expansions ever released. Story wise it rivals some the best FF stories in yearsBest FF Expansion since Heavensward, amazing story, OST, Combact, voice acting. Everything in this expansion is the best on this. Been plaing since half of the life of Heavensward and it gets better the more you play.Shadowbringers? More like Feelsbringers. Amazing story, captivating characters, fun side quests, and so much more to do. There\\'s endgame and still working on the game even after the credits roll. Come for the vierra, stay for Yoshi P.This is the best MMO experiences Ive ever had. From the music to the MSQ and everything in between.The story in Shadowbringer is leagues above other MMOs, really putting the RPG in MMORPG. The job system allows you to play any job you want without having to start a new character and going through the story all over again to do so. The community are overwhelmingly positive and helpful most of the time. If i had to pick only one MMO to play it would be FFXIV!Amazing expansion to an amazing MMO. Shadowbringers brings the stakes to a whole new level and easily manages to outdo the previous expansions. Incredible soundtrack, beautiful new areas and the always so captivating storyline.\\n\\nShadowbringers has also brought heaps of QOL changes concerning the gameplay (especially when it comes to crafting and gathering), so in case you have previously found the game too convoluted, it is now easier than ever for both new and old players to jump in.The is just the best extension ever and maybe... the best Final Fantasy game I\\'ve ever played until now. What a hell of a ride, it\\'s just AMAZING !\\nThe whole plot is well written, full of drama and hope.\\n\\nIf you\\'re still wondering if you should play it, don\\'t hesitate. Go for it.A great addition to good MMORPG, the developers of which love both their brainchild and their community.Shadowbringers is one of the best stories in the entire final fantasy series (definitely the best since the merger of Square and Enix) and the best expansion of ffxiv. I\\'m not a fan of mmorpgs but this one is a must. While the initial story may not be the best (they will modify it in the near future to make it better and shorter) the expansions are incredibly good and have a lot of content. (the base game is still good but heavensward and shadowbringers are just incredible)Best MMO Expansion like..ever?\\nThe Launch was smooth with barely any issues, the queue was long but it was to be expected.\\nThe story is as top tier as it gets, i doubt  any other MMO will even come close to be equal or surpass it.\\n\\nThe music is the best ive heard in an MMO, like it fits so well with the theme and its just perfect.\\n\\nThe Nier: Automata raid and the gear are well done and really fun and exciting ofc Yoko Taro was involved in it!\\n\\nFFXIV: Shadowbringers is probably the best FF story told in decades.\\n\\nBalance wise some classes have improved much better than when Shadowbringers launced so thats no longer an issue.\\n\\nThe new trials and dungeons were amazing with most of them awarding a really good looking gear.\\n\\nPatch 9.3 which will release near Summer will have the base story of the game remade and shortend to fit better into the theme of the expansions going forward which will also make it less annoying for new players to get into as thats really the biggest drawback for new players atm.\\n\\nOverall a 10 out of 10. Really well done SE!I played the previous expansions as a mean to cope with loneliness and a break up. This expansion made me mad and frustrated because after finding a soulmate and settling down in a new adult, functional life with a partner, I still got dragged into the unforgiving cycle of playing another expansion and it’s 5 patches. Shadowbringers dragged me back into the sad life of feeling for made-up characters and world (this time they managed to make a whole fresh one) after I have managed to find happiness in real life. And guess what? My boyfriend got addicted too after seeing the overwhelming feedback from the game. How can it be that after all that time my life is still bound to FF14, a once failed game, the story of which only became such an effective PR tool. Maybe the game is just that good? PS: I managed to stay unsubbed for 1 month before Yoshi-P was like, hey your Viera ass can now carry a **** umbrella to show the world how much of a slut you are. Come back and build your new housing quarter!!! I need more money so my dumbass son can pay his Fortnite season pass.Excellent exercution from yoshi p true legend and sme one who cares and takes are views as inportant 3 years I Ben playing ff14 gets better better not like **** ff7R ending ff14 u are my saving grace thank u yoshi p sampoFinal Fantasy XIV and her last addition to Shadowbringers is an amazing game and an incredible story that I probably will remember for life.\\nRarely in which game you will find such a level of quality of the plot and such a deep look at the characters.\\nFFXIV quietly comes to your life on a lone wagon of the hidden chokobo and takes you, a simple traveler, to an incredible adventure that will change your life both in the game and in reality.\\nDo not wait, start playing, because this game costs much more than these 10 points.\\n_________________________\\n\\nFinal Fantasy XIV and Its LATET Expansion Definite Anwesome Gaming Experience and Incredible Story that I Will Remember for a Lifetime.\\nITS Quite Hard Nowadays to find a game that WOULD HAVE SUCH A GEAT LEVEL of StoryTelling and CharACTERS Writing.\\nFFXIV Quietly Arrives in Yor Life on A Lonely Carriage Drawn by a Chocobo and Takes You, A Simple Traveler, Into An Inventure That Will Change Life Forevers\\nDo Not Wait, Start Playing, BecAuse This Game Costs Much and More THANT 10 POINTS.I bought it without even finishing heavensward and never played cause i cant afford the subscription. 10/10, would buy againwhat an absolute win for square enix to have this be the start of their new future , this is without a shadow of a doubt a game worth playing no question about it and people won\\'t know the true value of it for generations to comeI have not felt this happy to play this game since Heavensward. This is brilliant. All the attention to detail. All the small improvements to the engine to deliver high quality, expression rich cutscenes. The voicework in the german version also saw a huge increase in production quality. The gameplay may be lacking for some but I think its absolutely brilliant. Beyond that, You only need to pay about 60$ to play the full game, since Shadowbringers includes all previous expansions. This is a brilliant package and everyone should give it a try. Even if the content before looses out in comparison to this newest expansion. Especially the early game needs to be retouched.\\n\\nEither way, most of my critisism doesn\\'t concern the changes Shadowbringer does to the game. So a solid 10 from me.Nothing on the market has never been more true to the game type MMO-RPG than FF14 with their newly released expansion. The story, music, zones, new jobs, battle changes are just beautiful. I\\'m at loss for words to describe my experience trough ShadowbringersShadowbringers is a really a game full of emotions. The story is great, epic from the beginning to the end.\\n\\nAnd the truth behind everything... The truth, guys... The end of this game is incredible.Amazing storyline!! The community is as friendly as MMO\\'s go and the level of character customisation/expression is amazing. Very immersive and lots of attention to detail in both the graphics and the interfaceHaving played FFXIV since ver 1.0, I’ve seen the game change and grow over the years.  It’s been a joy too see the game become something that was nothing but a instrument of frustration to the truly great game it is todayVer 1.0 was a mess, and I was ready to abandon this game. Having come from other MMOs I was not impressed to say the least, but when Yoshida came onboard and made his promises to the players, I was doubtful anything would happen, but it did intrigue me.What he did to make good on those promises, and weaving the disaster of the original game into the lore of the Calamity event (fitting name) was masterful. By the end of its lifecycle ver 1.0 was playable and enjoyable a miracle when given what he had to work with.After the servers went down, launching ARR after the long wait was like a breath of fresh air, ARR had pacing issues and such but compared to 1.0, it was amazing, and set the firmament for what was to come. The after story for ARR was painful, you could see Square was struggling with what to do now, since it was apparent pre ARR release they didn’t think the redux was actually going to pay off.  As the months went on I played on, it was like any MMO I understood, Fuller grinds and such.  I wasn’t terribly impressed, but I saw nothing different so played XIV as well as some other MMOs at the time.Heavensward came out and it’s narrative, was amazing.  The atmosphere it set of the world, long standing cultural and literal warfare as the setting was moving. The story was subtle and we were given a deeper understanding of the world we were set in.  The Post HW stories were brief but numerous and kept me involved.The storytelling had come to its own, and I looked forwards to what was to come.  Stormblood came out and the pacing was so different from HW, the story wasn’t as nuanced but showcased a dichotomy where we weren’t focused on one area but two, expanding our view of the world two fold, and showcasing two opposite outcomes of war.  We felt the urgency a bit too much as the pacing had us jumping in and out of two lands but it’s also where the character development started becoming unquestionably refined.  Certain characters become beloved. Certain characters you should feel NO sympathy for, became human.  The worlds NPCs became more than just the 2d characters and villains that serve no purpose than to play their part and fade away from the spotlight.  The after story of SB especially showed that every character you meet probably has a history you may not expect.  And we as the hero are allowed to glimpse that history and understand. Now with Shadowbringers, the storytelling has reached a pinnacle. From the magnificent send off from Stormblood, the last story arc and that final dungeon...  we the players are thrust into a story that draws you in from the opening quest, and subsequent change in venue that quest launches.  We’re presented a slow thought out world, where our conversations feel meaningful and the characters we meet are deeper than just a fetch quest placeholder.  Don’t get me wrong, the quest is probably to fetch something, but you feel there’s a meaning for actually needing it to be done.  Then almost immediately the game sets the stakes high, and inspires the player to want to be a hero.  Want to make things right. Want to figure out a resolution as the problems are encountered.  And these problems?  These problems are set in such a beautiful crafted world, that changes so much as you advance from zone to zone. So very beautiful and complimented by a magnificent musical score. The most consistently great so far.All in all Shadowbringers interweaves all those elements. Characters, environment, music to create a story that makes you want to see how it ends. It rewards you emotionally as well as breaks your heart when appropriate, the world of shadowbringers, has that balance, and makes you want to believe you can make that difference, after all you are the Warrior of Ligh...Darkness...Taken as it is, the story is incomplete if you’re a new player, havingbto work Through all the last content may seem burdensome, but it’s so worth it.  You are the hero here, imagine how many hours of your own lore you’re creating. Not just observing but actually creating a heroic history, with so many moments of pain and triumph that you will feel attached to your character, regardless if you have the best gear or not.  It’s not the destination so much in XIV as the journey, and after Shadowbringers, you’ll want to see more than ever where the journey will go. The creative team shows their love for the game with Shadowbringers and has raised the bar so high, it will be difficult to keep up to par, let alone surpass it.  But I believe Yoshi-P and the team can, and I want to see them succeed. And I intend to be there when they raise that bar higher still.This is one of the best Final Fantasy stories in the last two decades and the best I have ever played (I\\'ve played VIII, X, XII, XIII). This story alone beats a lot of non-MMO RPGs out there. The voice acting was top-notch and even better than previous expansions. The character development was high quality as well. The cutscenes were well directed as well making the dramatic moments feel much more impact. I couldn\\'t stop taking screenshots of my characters whenever there was a big moment going on in the story. Big credit to the story writers here. The zones were also incredible. Each time I enter a new zone, I was always in disbelief in how much prettier the game and environment got with each new zone. There are definitely times where I stop and took in the sights of the environment. And this without mentioning the music as well. The music that accompanies the zones does a really great job at capturing the mood and atmosphere of the story. Same with the trials as well. The buildup to the 2nd and 3rd fight were great as well making the fights feel much more epic. Credit to Soken for composing an awesome soundtrack.\\n\\nThe only issue I had was the amount of time between the first and second dungeon (but it\\'s understandable as it fits with the story\\'s pacing). The story will make you laugh and cry. This is a tale told of epic proportions.Spoiler-free review, you have to experience it on your own.\\n\\nI\\'ve always thought that MMORPGs need to have an awful story by default. That it\\'s just a checkbox to mark like in Hack&Slashes - where gameplay is all that matters. I was sure the story is a necessary evil to drive the player around to do quests or grind through the content. Years of playing World of Warcraft solidified that opinion for me.\\n\\nNaoki Yoshida (the director of FFXIV) and Natsuko Ishikawa (the writer) have proven me wrong.\\nNot only FFXIV Shadowbringers has undoubtedly the best story ever written in an MMORPG, even better than universally praised Heavensward expansion from the same game, but also one of the best stories I have seen in any RPG I\\'ve played for the last decade at least. Not often do I have goosebumps during a cutscene in a video game, but Shadowbringers is just so good I\\'m not ashamed of admitting it.\\nThe music is also on the next level. Masayoshi Soken has again proven his mettle - he makes the highest grade video game music, on equal footing with Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Cross) and Nobuo Uematsu (FF series). It suplements the story of FFXIV in a way that when combined it truly deserves the unofficial title of KINObringers.\\n\\nThe gameplay and graphics suffer a little bit in Final Fantasy, having to accommodate for console players. They\\'re not bad, mind you - they just aren\\'t at their full potential due to the PS3/PS4 limitations. But if I have to judge the expansion on its own it\\'s still a perfect 10 for me. Worth every penny spent.\\n\\nIt\\'s made with love and care, which is especially impressive if you account that (allegedly) the game is made on a shoestring budget. It\\'s an RPG first and MMO second, but it knocks-out the competition from the get-go and for me it reigns are the king of MMORPGs in the year 2019.Comparing this expansion with all main series Final Fantasy games, would still easily put it near the top.  Huge praise to the team working on this game.  All of the other recent Final Fantasy IP\\'s could learn a lesson or five from them.Best mmorpg best DLC music 10/10 the new classes is good,new location and the best story.Even if you aren\\'t a huge fan of MMO and are just looking for a good RPG to play this game is it. I have played many Final Fantasy games in my 26 years being alive and seeing everything come to life is amazing. If you have a favorite Final Fantasy game you will find that this game pulls ideas from all of them and molds it into something amazing.\\nThis expansion however is the best that XIV has to offer thus far and the bar was pretty high to begin with after Heavensward and Stormblood. Shadowbringers sets the bar even higher. If you are looking for an immersive game with a great soundtrack with an engaging story and gameplay you won\\'t be disappointed.I got early excess and started playing day 1 and love itStory -definitely took a darker tone watching a character become a sin eater you sit there as the greater sin eater stabs the npc trying to protect a child who will become a sineater himself in time then transform barfing out light the main on her face as her eyes go blacl then the change is done. Combat for summoner & fates -the changes feel good as a summoner getting bahmuhut after 1 trance feels great and Then going into fire bird trance definitely keeps you busy in a fun way. I’ve been mainly leveling thro fates since you benefit both through exp and rewards you get from trading gems is nice once I’ve finished summoner it’s gonna be nice doing fate trains to level my other jobs to get more options in the shopEnding statement-I really love what they’ve changed and loving the story and will continue to love it going forward… ExpandSeriously puts a lot of video game stories to shame. You thought your precious heavensward was good? You might want to plan a funeral for it... because Shadowbringers puts it six feet in the ground. May be the best story I’ve ever experienced and really pulls all the lore from the last near decade of content in lovely. You’ve never experienced anything like this in a game. It’s just next level.The Story is one of the best ones in the Final Fantasy Franchise and in MMO\\'s to this date. Classes are fun, endgame is interesting and there is a lot to do after you got your first class to 80. Also the 35€ Price tag is a absolute steal for the amount of content.This is the most Final Fantasy game in almost a decade. The story, the cast, the music, it rivals or even exceeds that of single player JRPGs. Square Enix has done a great job on producing this title. Just over a decade ago, FFXIV was a massive failure. But they since then made an amazing comeback to bring Shadowbringers today.You won\\'t find an MMO (And few games in general) with a stronger story or more meticulously crafted music. The new QOL updates and Jobs are aces! Can\\'t recommend this game more!Anyone who is voting this low hasn’t played it (or is likely a WoW fanboy). Shadowbringers is a flawless expansion, a rare gem of a game that improves in every way upon the game while somehow managing to be an entire standalone game in its own right (storywise).I’ve laughed, I’ve cried, and all I want to do is do it over and over again with different characters.If you love Final Fantasy, MMOs, or incredible storytelling this game is for you...If you just want to hurry up and beat the endgame content without having to play the game.....this is still for you, but you will need to purchase a token to bypass the story.This is, without a doubt. The best MMO expansion ever.I love this game already, but this expansion made me love it 1000x more, the only real thing that is a problem now is the healer category as I\\'ve heard, other then that every other aspect of the game has been vastly improved. Story is great, music is great. I hope only for the best for this games future, because it is in my personal top 3 for games of all time.FF14 is amazing ! If you never played it, download the free trial and see for yourself !This expansion to FFXIV is the best one yet! I couldn\\'t believe this level of quality could even be reached. The world, the character development, the music and story especially were top notch this time around. It does feel slow if the story isn\\'t what you\\'re interested in. Many, many long cutscenes and dialogues. This entry solidly made me realize that this is a Final Fantasy game first and foremost with great multiplayer elements to go along with it. I can\\'t wait to see how they top this.This has been by far the best expansion launch in any MMO I\\'ve ever seen. And the game keeps improving as the devs listens to the community pleas, 10/10This game has surpassed my expectations and has taken up all my free time since launch and early access. Amazing game by the developers and everyone who worked hard on this and amazing music from Soken.Not only is this the best Expansion i’ve played in XIV, i’d go as far as to say this is also the best FF game i’ve ever played, and could even say it’s the best game overall that i’ve ever played. The music, the the visuals, the storytelling. It all left me one great big emotional mess. It’s going to be a long time before anything tops this game experience for meMust play. Square Enix are on it. GOAT. Very good. Best MMO out there. Recommend to everyone.One of the best FF’s to date! The music, the story and the backstory for the story creates a masterpiece that game developers in the west can only wish to compare to nowadays due to corporate greed! Kudos to square, Yoshida - San, and the devs of final fantasy!Great Expansion, Story has only gotten better with XIV as time has gone on, great new features such as the trust system, personally loving the Monk rework making it a true powerhouse dps.No better time to come back to the game.The best Final Fantasy game in 2 decades. The story will grab you and not let go, and you\\'ll love every minute of it.FF14 is a perfect MMO!\\nYOSHIDA is my papa!\\nYOSHIDA is my papa!\\nYOSHIDA is my papa!\\nYOSHIDA is my papa!\\nYOSHIDA is my papa!Shadowbringers can obviously be called the best addition to the Final Fantasy XIV! The presentation of history, atmosphere, music.Square Enix made a huge job!A lot of time has passed since the release of a realm Reborn!And I see a breakthrough in the development of the game!Shadowbringers is what we were waiting for in 2019!Thank you, Square Enix for a masterpiece!Played during early access and once i finished the MSQ i must say, hands down GOTY for me, what a great experience, been emotionally invested trough the story and even weeping in some parts. This game is absolute wonderfulOne of the best stories I have ever seen, great music and awesome gameplay :)The best Final Fantasy story I’ve ever played. I am just completely blown way. The music is incredible, the new zones are beautiful. The dungeons are amazingly designed. Even the voice acting is amazing. You can see how much hard work the dev team have put into this game and it really shines through. An excellent expansion to an already fantastic mmo.Simply the best expansion released for FFXIV. It has come to the point where you can consider FFXIV\\'s story as one of the best FF stories out there.\\n\\nShB comfortable **** on a lot of RPG stories in the last decade or so.I made an account just to rate this. I finished the main scenario quests a couple hours ago and I have no words that can truly describe just how epic it was. If there was a way to say \"wtf\" and \"holy sh!t\" at the same time, I\\'d be shouting it until I lost my voice. The dev team has outdone themselves in every aspect. BravoAbsolutely the best Expansion FFXIV has to offer! The whole Expansion is a roller coaster of emotions from the start to the end ! If ur into the story. I strongly recommend to not buy the jump potion if you are a new player! You will miss out on a lot of the story wich leads up to Shadowbringers wich kinda brings all of the stuff that happened before to its conclusion! And theres more Adventures after!Too good for an mmo.The most final fantasy game I have played in last decade.I\\'m a lazy person and don\\'t really write review. FFXIV 5.0 made me registered an account in this website and wrote a review to pay my respect! The story is super super super good, personally I think it is better than 4.0 (stormblood)! New maps have very beautiful view!This Expansion is beyond fantastic!\\nFirst of all, let\\'s look at the bad parts, to show how few there are:\\n- The combat music for overworld battles is horrible\\n- The FPS cap was a mistake (although it\\'s being removed again)\\n- Many large areas look pretty empty\\n- From all the shiny old weapons they only implemented the Omega weapons for Gunbreaker and Dancer, unlike Stormblood, where they implemented almost all old weapons for Redmage and Samurai\\n\\nAnd that\\'s it! Everything else is absolutely wonderful:\\n- The music is wonderful through the bank. Every dungeon theme is on spot and fits the theme. Every boss theme is incredibly exciting. Every zone theme is absolutely perfect and when the area\\'s night is restored the music gets even better. And the Final battle\\'s music is unbelievable\\n- The story of this expansion is absolutely breathtaking, especially the ending. You thought Avengers: Endgame was a great ending? It is total crap compared to Shadowbringers\\'s ending. Shadowbringers genuinely made me cry for the bad guy in the end, despite having done the good deed. Never had this experience before\\n- The lore is so rich and well implemented, that you crave for more and actually want to listen to non-essential NPC conversations, which I never did before\\n- The changes to combat classes, despite them being a simplification of their rotations, feels extremely good, satisfying and rewarding now. Jobs feel much more intuitive and mistakes don\\'t punish you in such an unsatisfying way anymore (also, boss transitions aren\\'t such a pain anymore)\\n- The endgame is full of interesting stuff to do, like the Crystarium deliveries, FATE chains that reward you with several different things (apparently they\\'ve learned from Eureka), the typical expert dungeons (which also are very entertaining), very interesting extreme boss fights, countless Sightseeing Log spots that are a challenge to reach, level scaling Sidequests that now reward you with decent experience no matter when you take it and a soon to be released raid which I can\\'t wait to see\\n- The trust system (running dungeons with 3 story NPCs instead of 3 other players) is actually better than I imagined it would be. They perform flawlessly in every dungeon, which is great for players who still have difficulties learning the mechanics - even if you deliberately pull extra mobs (the NPCs can take it) - with the only downside vs real human players being that trust NPCs do much less damage and the dungeon takes longer to complete in general\\n- The new races Viera and Hrothgar - despite only existing as one gender each in the game for now - look absolutely stunning and despite thinking that not many players would pick up the bulky, muscular Hrothgar, I\\'ve actually seen lots and lots of them running around\\n- The two new jobs Dancer and Gunbreaker feel extremely great to play. Their animations and sound effects are super satisfying and their general gameplay feels extremely polished\\n- With the active subscriber count reaching over the 1 million players bar the game feels so full of other players and no matter where you go at any time everything feels so full\\n\\nAll in all, this is the best Final Fantasy XIV expansion so far - even a lot greater than Heavensward, which was already amazing and of course better than Stormblood, which was not that great in comparison, but still good.The best expansion of FFXIV and insane OST, breathtaking and tearing story, what I could ask for more.Best mmorpg best DLC music 10/10 the new classes is good,new location and the best story.',\n",
       " 'I was a big fan of the first Evil Within and the main reason for that is because it had a unique setting and it was accompanied with a unique story. Thankfully The Evil Within 2 continues this trend and in some ways it improves on the original game. The enemies you face in the game have a decent amount of variety to them and the best thing is that they’re actually scary at times. The enemies also make the combat scary and this fear when in combat makes the game stand out for all the right reasons. I was however frustrated when it came to the camera because the awkwardness of it did hinder me at times, especially when I was in dire situations. I also wasn’t a big fan of the shooting mechanics in the game and the main reason for that is because it didn’t have much fluidity and when shooting it instead felt clunky. There is however a decent variety when it comes to the weapons so you don’t have to use a gun if you don’t want to because there’s plenty of things for you to craft. My favourite thing about the game is that it allows you a lot of freedom through exploration, and this is great because it stops the game from feeling linear. The presentation side of the game is awesome and can really create a scare or two. I was especially fond of the art design in the game because I thought the gore was done to perfection. At the end of the day while the few niggling problems the game has stops it from being a masterpiece there is still a very good game here. The main and most important thing The Evil Within 2 did is that it kept things interesting and exciting throughout, and with the added fear factor thrown in for good measure it made it difficult for me to put the game down. Fans of the first game will love The Evil Within 2 and if you’ve never tried an Evil Within game before then I suggest you check it out.The Evil Within 2 continues the first game\\'s story and also it\\'s style: playing stealth, using resources carefully, explore and feel the tension building up. Again, this game allows itself to take player out of context and make everything unexpected. The only drawback in my opinion are the rather generic cut scenes and the kind of superficial story. Overall a very good game though.A great evolution of the first, challenging, gameplay has improved a lot and great immersion.\\nCons: Confused history like the first and some bugs.This game is everything I expect from the survival horror genre. It\\'s creepy, has a good story, good characters and the graphics are very good. I\\'m a silent hill fan so I really loved this game. I\\'m glad that games like these are still being made.Every thing I wish it in games I found in the evil within two .. I actually it is one of the best 5 games I have played in my life ..… ExpandIn this review, only the negative aspects of the game are considered. The purpose of this work is to help you to get a better decision on the purchase of the game\\n\\nWeak points:\\n- There is nothing here :) go and buy this game ASAP!Super amazing story and gameplay. Hopefully the\\'l make another chapter. It had been quite a while since i jumped from the chair.Absolutely superb game. Better that the First One in Pretty much everythingIt\\'s better than the first game in terms of gameplay and graphics. The plot to continue the story of the first game was also very goodLet me start by saying that I truly believe this is the greatest horror game of all time, and that\\'s coming from someone completely obsessed with the Silent Hill and Resident Evil series.\\n\\nAs twisted as this game is, I couldn\\'t wipe the smile off my face the entire time. The Evil Within 2 is worth your time, especially if you\\'re looking for something to scratch the survival-horror itch.\\n\\nEnjoy your stay in Union!Extraordinary this game is really a great smart and new style that is all -like and beautiful… ExpandDo yourself a favor and get this game immediately! This might be my new favorite game of all time... It reminded me of the first time I played Resident Evil 2 on the PS1. Seriously loved this game so much. Gameplay 10/10, Visuals 10/10 and Story 10/10. There\\'s also a tremendous amount of replay-ability here with all the collectibles.Excellent, one of the best I’ve ever played. Challenging, frustrating, beautiful.I am in part 3 of the game I am preceding some bugs, but the game is spectacular, the Xbox One version has some FPS fall bottles, but that would be the minimum to know ...!The last review I posted here was for Dead Space 3. I gave it a 10 because, while yes it had faults, I enjoyed the heck out it and isn\\'t that what it\\'s about? For the same reasons, I give Evil Within 2 a 10. I  literally spent over 40 hours in 1 play though, going through every nook and cranny to uncover secrets, craft materials and more. There were moments with the \"Anima\" ghost lady that literally scared me, whether in a tight, small room or out in the open streets. Loved the monsters and found the story intriguing. I really hope this game sold well and they will make Evil Within 3. I\\'d pre-order it for sure! Love this series...  Keep \\'em coming!So i just wrote a huge review and the server hung up....\\nAnyways ill keep it short this time, the game was fantastic, one of my favorite of all time. Play it for a truly blissful experience.An absolutely superb sequel to an already outstanding experience. This game delivers everything you love from the first game along with new welcome additions such as semi-open world levels, a variety of new weapons and really homes in on the stealth. The only negatives include a less interesting villain and fewer scarier and diverse enemies than the first game. But still a must buy!Visually beautiful, horrifyingly unsettling, and unbelievably fun. Although I enjoyed the first Evil Within, the second blows the first out of the water. The Evil within 2 is by far my favorite survival horror game, and that says alot because there are so many great survival horror games i love out there. Do yourself a favor and play this game, i cannot praise it enough.I\\'m playing this on the new Xbox One X and it\\'s amazing! Especially with the Dolby Atmos surround sound in my headphones. The Evil Within 2 is a fun experience... one not seen very often. This game belongs up there with the greats like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption and Witcher 3. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the first game in years that I had trouble putting it down. It\\'s just that good! MUST PLAY!The perfect sequel. Tango clearly absorbed all the feedback and experience from the first title and used it to create something better. The Evil Within was memorable for its tough gameplay and great horror elements, but received criticism mainly for its confusing story and failure to make us care about Sebastian. The Evil Within 2 shines thanks to amazing combat mechanics, enemy variety, and resource management where every bullet mattered. The story, although still tropey at times, does a much better job of offering a goal to aim toward while making Sebastian more intriguing as a protagonist. All in all, it\\'s a great game if you\\'re a fan of challenging 3rd person shooters and love scary, atmospheric worlds to explore.This is a big improvement over an already decent original in my opinion. There\\'s still competently balanced combat, engaging resource management, enemy variety, and memorable bosses just like the Evil Within.\\nThis game brings more to the table with a few limited open world environments and a crafting system that fit in so well you\\'d wonder why they weren\\'t thought of in the original.\\nThe biggest standout over the original game is, however, the atmosphere and story that The Evil Within 2 has this time around. Tango has dispensed with the generic \"edge-lord\" Ruvik that the end of the first game teased. In his place we have a variety of equally hammy but so much more charismatic and memorable antagonists that plague Sebastian this time around.\\nThere are some pacing issues and plenty of plot holes, but the Evil Within 2 provides one of the most sincere and genuine cheese-baked stories I\\'ve experienced in a Triple-A game in a while.Great game and a great improvement over the original.  The new monsters are scary, the new upgradable abilities are stronger and more important, and the guns got a much needed boost (not that you\\'ll have enough ammo to feel comfortable using them all the time) .  The free roam style of game play gives this game a whole new style and way to play making stealth key and shot timing critical.  You can see many nods to resident evil in this game which would make sense coming from the man that made the good ones.  Pick this up and hunker down because this game is intense.  My only problem with this game however is the noticeable drop in framerate when facing multiple enemies at once especially with a flashlight on.  In a game where quickness and careful shot taking is so critical I got very frustrated when the game slowed down so often.  Aside from that, pick this game up!Personal opinion: a piece of horror game, one of the best on ps4, quite complete I would say, drinks from other classics such as resident Evil and silent Hill, but with its own personality, there are moments for terror, for action  and stealth.  All this in a formidable story where it continues where the first part ended.  The duration is very good, it is quite long.  I also like the graphics, it has a variety of scenarios always well carved.  Perfect and scary sound.  Recommended for horror lovers.… ExpandCool game, a great plot, the best part I hope there will be a sequel.Really magnificent game.It is difficult to imagine a game that can attract you with gameplay and plot, narrative, general design of the whole world and interesting ideas ... The only minus of the game is graphics.Really such a level for 2017.Great continuation of the first part.The plot has become less confusing, the graphics became better, the musical component at a high level.And the finale ... The final pleased me.Still, I hope there will be a third part and they will tell us the whole story until the endin my opinion this game is the most entertaining and value of money game of ps4 xbox one era… ExpandIm writing this Review 3 years after The launch of this game But screw it. The Evil Within is a Spetacular Survival and Action Horror, with an amazing Protagonist and some good Villains too. The gameplay it\\' s a little fought but you get used to it. Graphics are 9/10 for a game launched on 2017 and stealth system is pretty good but nothing so \"Woooow\". The Evil within 2 Fulfills its role in the proposal that was found 10/10I\\'m lazy, it\\'s takes a lot for me to take the time to come on here and write a review, I played the first game so I\\'m used to the controls, I was blown away by the ending, one of the best I\\'ve played in awhile, loved the way they brought some of the old bosses from the first game into this one.  I had a lot of fun playing this game, it\\'s worth your time, also play it on NightmareI\\'m giving this a 9 but rating 10 because of the haters. This is a game with ambition and it offers alot of compelling gameplay and imaginative horror sequences. The Evil Within 2 is essential for anyone who likes genre classics like Silent Hill or Resident Evil. Unlike those games, it makes the bold decision to allow players the freedom to roam it\\'s world without many of the corridor constraints typical for this style of game and it\\'s mostly successful. I wouldn\\'t agree with the term \\'open world\\' here, but the levels are certainly big with many places to explore and plenty of dark creepy corners you would rather avoid. There\\'s plenty of freedom to tackle enemies in different and sometimes imaginative ways. Speaking of enemies, they\\'re about as repulsive and freakishly scary as anything I\\'ve seen in a game of this kind. Brilliant audio design makes this a game to play with the lights off and head phones on. A worthy sequel which is often better and certainly more immersive than it\\'s predecessor.Shinji Mikami hit harder with this sequel. The best new iteration they could come over with. A spellbinding atmosphere is at work coupled with a more accurate gameplay. The scenario has been the target of the developers this time giving raise to a much more heady depiction of Sebastian Castellanos. Breathtaking cutscenesI loved it ... I am playing it from Game Pass I tried it and it was spectacular I love this option to try a game without depending on buying it previously, a glory ... expandThis is definitely an improvement in some ways, but a bit of a let down in others. The scares, the visual design, music, atmosphere, gunplay, survival aspects are all top notch. That said, moving to a Dishonored like hub world kind of kills the pacing, which is crucial to a horror game. I spent 4 hours in chapter three just doing map markers, which can be great for some games, but not so much for this.\\n\\nPerformance-wise, it\\'s pretty solid but it does stutter a bit after starting up.This game really falls apart after the first boss fight. Gameplay is repetitive and characters are unmemorable. Sebastian looks and talks like **** compared to the first game. Also he is very poorly written as a dad, I couldn’t take his “character development” seriously. The characters felt more human in the first game.Everything is garbage lol I really wanted and tried to like this game but I just couldn’t! I miss the first gameThe first Evil Within had such charms and this game abandoned all of them. I can see why this game flopped so hard, it\\'s just sad.This game is a downgrade from the first one in every way. Like a weaker sequel of Silent Hill Downpour. The “open” map wasn’t well made. The writing was one of the worst ones I’ve seen in video games.Plot is not as good as it wants to be. Characters, including its lead, are forgettable. Writing is awful. Level design is weak. Graphics are sub-par. Combat is OK. Greater freedom surmounts to greater emptiness (not every game should be open world). Boss battles are tedious. Really tedious. There are many aspects of the game that are unpolished. I fell through the world. Sneak attacks failed me way to often. I don\\'t remember any moments where it felt like I was playing horror game (this is the biggest disappointment). Many of its moments of sentimentality are ruined by feeling distant and being contradicted by the next scene. Example; Sebastian has a long illusion where his wife helps him to realise that he had no reason to feel guilt (for stuff), but in the next scene he seems to have immediately forgot this therapy session and has to be convinced again.\\nI liked the original. I didn\\'t like this. At all. Too many ideas. It lost the polish and tension of the original.The first game was way better in terms of story, atmosphere and enemy designs. The story of this game is terrible, it retcons the first game so much. Some main characters from TEW1 are not even mentioned, which is so weird and unsatisfying. Save your daughter storyline is really lazy and boring. It’s like a cliche movie from 80s. None of the antagonists in this game have interesting backstory like Ruvik. And it really offended me that TEW2 treated almost all of women characters so badly. Buy The Evil Within 1 instead.In terms of horror, story, art direction and atmosphere this game is such a downgrade from the first game.\\n\\nThe gameplay isn\\'t so special also.First off, the game looks nice and i think the team who made it really gave it everything they had, and i appreciate that. With that said it controls like resident evil 4 with a wet blanket on it, which makes it really hard to get into the story. Picture aiming down the scope but your character seems to be getting cramps that make them swerve left and right erratically. Sebastian \"I knew i shouldn\\'t have had that bean burrito before plugging in.\"  Story wise is it kind of feels like Max Payne meets Resident Evil and somehow also makes me think of the N64 game Nightmare Creatures in terms of enemy design and they never really come together. I got EW2 (man it\\'s bad that\\'s the abbreviation) with a discount and if i could go back i probably wouldn\\'t pick it up again.\\n\\nIn closing,  it feels like suspense in this was confused for poor fighting mechanics. The sound is good, the graphics are pretty cool, but unfortunately, the interaction ruins it for me.I played this on PS4 and I hate this game\\'s story and direction so much that I put negative review here as well. If you loved the first game, you would be disappointed with this game.I think this game takes itself too seriously. where should I start… well, the first problem is the protagonist. It feels like they wanted to give Seb more personality than the first game, but they definitely failed to do that. EW2 Seb is just a garbage character, who isn\\'t very realistic and feels like anime in a bad way. I cringed at some of his overacting and cheesy lines. And he isn\\'t even good as a sad-dad protag. I feel that devs emphasized his sad-dadness in this game to make him more human and to make players be sorry for him(I remember one of the developers in tango proudly tweeted like \"This game\\'s Sebastian is daddy Sebastian!\" on twitter before the game was released), but he isn\\'t really a good dad in this game. His character is very poorly written and poorly developed. This game\\'s Sebastian enjoys shooting game while he searches for his daughter, he is such type of dad. Despite that the devs tries really hard to show us some emotional moments between him and his daughter. I was like just no. I don\\'t care about Sebastian as a dad. I don\\'t care about Lily, who is also poorly-written. Seriously **** The Evil Within 2, I don\\'t care for you at all. Give us back the great first game. Just bring back Ruvik, Leslie and Joseph. Don\\'t ever abandon your own game and characters again.Sadly, this game is not as fun or interesting as the first game. We can clearly feel that they ran out of time, money and ideas in the development.This game kept giving me headaches so didn\\'t complete it.  But got to Chapter 6.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Good graphics\\n- I through the gameplay especially the stealth was well done\\n\\nCons:\\n- Unfortunately I kept getting a headache after playing this game\\n- I couldn\\'t stand the main character personallyThe Evil Within 2\\nNot enough of its own thing\\nThe Evil within 2 a quote unquote Survival horror game where you once again play as Sebastian...\\nThis time however the story is much more personal and therefore miles better than the original as you’re out to save your daughter instead of chase after a lunatic…\\nThe story has some touching moment and is greatly told… easily the best part of this experience…\\nThe rest of the game though for the most part in my opinion is a step in the wrong direction…\\nThis game calls itself a horror game, but to me this 12 and a half hours felt more like an action 3rd person shooter zombie game with sprinkles of horror.. especially compared to the first…\\nthere are the occasional monsters like the first game, and there are a few really great chapters here, especially in the beginning…\\nBut The Evil Within 2 went more the route of an open world supply gathering stealth game than a linear puzzle solving horror game like the original..\\nThe makes for a really good action game... not for a very good horror games as I find zombies to be more annoying than they are scary…\\nThe Evil Within 2 is essentially taking Resident Evil 4, Silent Hills, The Evil Within, and The Last of Us and throwing it into a blender, but never quite being as good as any of those 4 parts…\\nThe first half of the game is more open worldy, where you’re in a creep town called union..\\nThere are side quests all around this town that will lead to creepy encounter, enemies to kill for their goo... but more importantly weapons…\\nIF you want all the weapons in this game you have to actually work for them…\\nI didn’t dislike this section of the game… I just could’ve definitely done without it…\\nI was tense while exploring this tiny town trying my hardest to not alarm enemies, kill them for their goo get what I can and get out… go back to the safe house, upgrade my weapons with the scraps I found a round a get back out there…\\nWhich is where the last of us influence comes into play…\\nThe light crafting system here for ammo and medpacks is heavily inspired by the last of us, and you can craft items on the go, but doing so at a crafting table uses less materials, so is worth searching for..\\nSpeaking of the green goo...\\nthe nurse lady in the mirror is back to help you on your journey to save your daughter... letting you upgrade your health, combat, and stealth in a skill tree in exchange..\\nYou’ll also be able to take to a shooting range for rewards to help upgrade your character...\\nStealth this time around feels a little clunky to me and enemies are annoyingly unpredictable… where I found them turning around right before I was ready to get them from behind with a quick kill…\\nthough combat isn’t too difficult, as most will go down with a couple nice headshots, ammo seems to be pretty readily available, and you’re able to pick up axes that work as a 1 hit kill melee attack.. .though you do have a knife if you’re out of ammo or materials to craft more... which is a situation I never found myself in…\\nEspecially thanks to the safe houses in this game where you can stock up on a few bullets and refill your health with a cup of coffee so you can save your syringes and med packs for boss fights…\\nThe best part of this game is when you get back into the main storyline…\\nThere are a great number of characters you’ll run into, hate, and even care for…\\nAnd some of the missions do the cool layers of fear thing where you turn around and the room is changed or there’s a door there that wasn’t there before… really creeping you out…\\nSadly these creepy moments only exist in the first half and the horror aspects completely disappear until something else happens for a brief moment that ties into the first game that I won’t spoil, but it just reminded me of the potential of this series and made me sad when the game continued and I was just back to feeling like I was Nathan drake with none of the charm having a weird nightmare…\\nI was a huge fan of the original evil within until a game breaking bug stopped me from completing it…\\nThankfully the evil within 2 is much more polished and I ran into 0 bugs the whole time…\\nIt’s just not what I wanted from it…\\nThe Evil Within 2 feels like a completely different game than the original..\\nIt’s just lacking in the horror field... I’m tired of zombies…\\nBut for what it is, this is a really good action game…\\nI give The Evil Within 2\\na 7.5/10I loved The Evil Within, I played it 5 times.. Initially I was very dissapoimted in this sequel as it is very different from the first game. But once you figure out the mechanics and realise this is a stealth game , it becomes a very unique and enjoyable experiance..Side note , Kidman and Hoffman are 2 of my favorit NPVs . Their both well rounded charavter and cute AF.. Didnt like Kidman dlc though, I need some attack retaliation mechanics, not just running. Even if its a camera that zaps ghosts.Played this right after playing the first game with the DLS,\\nit was a smart move, the plot talks a lot about the first game, and the is a lot of correlation between the two.\\n\\nthis game, not like the first, have the element of open world, as when the player get to the town, he can do whatever he wants, I liked it, it felt more real, but my problem with it was that I felt pressure to finish the main task, so I didn\\'t walked around the town or did side quests to much.\\n\\nthe difficulty was changed after half of the game, it felt like a different game. also there was a change in the plot, but I will not get into it as I don\\'t want to give any story spoilers.\\n\\nFinal verdict,\\nit is a horror game, very recommended,A massive 9, cause it\\'s better than the first one. The only negative point is the lack of horror, as jump-scare and boss that made you bristle.\\n\\nIn other hand, we have a more vast arsenal and a \"open world\" with a exploration that rewards you.\\n\\nIf you love horror and shooting games (any of the both), it\\'s a game you should play. And if you have any experience with these games, go for a hard difficult, once the \"casual\" one is too easy and you\\'ll finish the game with a lots of healing items and ammo.Very little ammunition and it has bosses to face .. the game is not decided whether it is action or a Survival horror ..GOOD GAME GOOD HISTORY WITH Great End worse than the former is highly recommendedGreat work, in the molds of the classic Resident Evil, Shinji Mikami certainly did not forget how to make a good game.The original was not a great game, but had a tendency to crack under the weight of his own ambitions.Continuation is better in almost all respects.Tango Gameworks learned a lot.Story: 7/10\\nGameplay: 7/10\\nGraphics:8/10\\nMusic: 8/10\\nReplay: 6/10\\nBuying Advice: 6/10The worst sequel I\\'ve ever played. The story is just boring and not related to the first game at all. Even Sebastian is so different from the first game. The villains are all weak and boring. The gameplay lacks qualities. Such a disappointment.',\n",
       " 'What a AWESOME game that I never heard of before. The pace is outrageous and the game is so much fun! xD The gameplay never gets old and Im looking foward to making another run at it on hard difficulty!Vanquish is another Platinum Games title that still stands alone: think about how many third-person shooters we see, and six years after release, not a one can touch it.Vanquish basically makes players into a glass cannon - the power-suited Sam Gideon is incredibly fast and has all the offensive power he\\'ll ever need, including slow-mo, but he can\\'t take too many hits. The robotic enemies swarm into the locations and move for him, on the higher difficulty levels in particularEven though it took them seven years, I\\'m glad that SEGA & Platinum were brave enough to finally port a modern light gun game to the PC. Of course, you might look at Vanquish and be bewildered, confusing it for yet another generic console port cover-based third person shooter. Everything about Vanquish seems to emulate an arcade experience, from the walls of enemies thrown at you, to the neon green HUD & cheesy sound effects, to the frenetic campaign & cutscene design. As expected of any good arcade game, nothing going on really makes sense; the plot is just an excuse to create new locations and introduce bosses.\\n\\nFollow the adventures of Sam Gideon as you rocket-slide from cover to cover until you somersault-kick a Russian space robot in the face and spray LMG bullets into his allies in slow motion during the fall back to the ground. Sam\\'s movement is purposefully clunky, with loud mechanical grinding and slow animations, giving him a unique feeling from other Platinum Games characters that is more mecha than dancer. The only complaint I have about the combat is landing a melee attack will deplete your Augmented Reaction gauge. Normally when you enter low health, AR (slow motion) will trigger until your remaining gauge runs out, giving you ample reaction time to kill a few enemies around you and/or get to cover. Getting down to low health without the AR available will quickly result in you dying because of how many enemies are attacking you at once in most situations. This however is a small nitpick and the only negative I can think of when it comes to anything in regards to gameplay. Melee combat\\'s effectiveness varies wildly depending on the situation and is often more useful for making yourself airborne by kicking off of terrain. The complexity of combat slowly unfurls itself as your struggle to survive causes you to innovate with mechanics. This is yet another Platinum masterpiece that is easy to learn but difficult to master; watching YouTubers pull of complex maneuvers is as exciting as watching a DMC or Bayonetta playthrough despite the vastly different gameplay design.\\n\\nVanquish does everything it can to defy your expectations from a third-person shooter. While the music, SFX, and voice acting are all mediocre, everything else about this wild ride of a game elevates the experience to something special. Yet again, Platinum created something unique and memorable out of what could\\'ve been just another cover-based shooter. Even though it\\'s seven years late, Vanquish is still an excellent experience that shouldn\\'t be overlooked.I loved the game. it was pretty close to Gears of war but definately not as good. first hour was entertaining and fun but than it became repetitive and i could not follow the story at all. you can definitely pay once and enjoy the game. graphics were average.\\n\\noverall = 6.5There isn\\'t much game-play/mode improvement from the original, if any at all, aside from making it look prettier. Doesn\\'t matter really, bc this game was so far ahead of its time it may as well have come out this year.  Story isn\\'t amazing, but its there, and by no means is it bad.  Characters are the typical archetypes, and The cut scenes that move the story and develop these characters are great little jawns that give u a break from the absolutely frenetic nonstop action.  This is a must play game for fans of action games and shooters in general.  its far more than the sum of its parts; it honestly never gets boring.  The challenge is perfect, you may die a fair amount on the road to getting the hang of it, and finding your zone, but beyond that the pacing and challenge both seemed perfect to me. it doesn\\'t do anything revolutionary really, hence scoring it a 9 as opposed to a 10. i don\\'t remember ever hearing anything about this game when it first released, i suppose it had no marketing budget whatsoever. i remember buying it randomly at gamestop, when people still went to gamestop and traded in games for credit.  it was like 12$; i had the exact amount it costed leftover after buying what I came for so i took the chance on it, and boy am i happy i did. Loved it then, and i love that they released it on PC as that\\'s all i really play on these days. i ended up playing it more than the game i had come to get ,which i believe was Bioshock 2(good game but really no difference from the first, more a DLC than a true sequel that they charged the price of a full game for, but that is another discussion entirely).  I would honestly argue that this is one of, if not THE,  single most CRIMINALLY UNDER-RATED game of all time. no exaggeration. i stay up on my VG news and like I mentioned this one slipped under my radar when it initially dropped, which probably dampened my expectations and allowed me to go in with a totally open mind. If you love shooters you absolutely, without question must play this game....Godspeed Sam!Despite all the flashness its just another boring 3rd person cover based shooter with braindead bullet sponge enemies, and everything in the scenery kinda has the same color even your character, nothing pops out.Vanquish basically makes players into a glass cannon - the power-suited Sam Gideon is incredibly fast and has all the offensive power he\\'ll ever need, including slow-mo, but he can\\'t take too many hits. The robotic enemies swarm into the locations and move for him, on the higher difficulty levels in particular making a beeline for the flanking spots. So your main offensive tool is movement: this is a \\'cover\\' shooter about catching a breather then blasting off in another direction, rather than lining up behind a trash can to hold off an army.\\n\\nVanquish is another Platinum Games title that still stands alone: think about how many third-person shooters we see, and six years after release not a one can touch itVanquish\\ndon’t believe the hype\\nVanquish is a 7 hour long 3rd person shooter where you play as agent Sam with a sick augmented reaction suit.\\nRussia destroys San Francisco with a solar beam and demands the United States surrenders before they do the same to New York and you set out to stop this.\\nBefore you do play this game, I need to bring you back down to reality, because this is not some hidden gem classic that everyone on the internet makes it out to be…\\nDon’t get me wrong… Vanquish is a really fun game...\\nThe shooting feels great, you can slide around on the ground for slow motion shots or just move around maps faster…\\nAnd when you take too much damage the game will go into slow motion allowing you to find cover or have a better shot at taking out the enemy before you die\\nWhich makes for some pretty epic feeling gun play…\\nAnd the best part of this game is the guns and their upgrades…\\nThere’s a huge variety of weapons here to find what you like best...\\nYou can carry up to 3 weapons at a time plus grenades, and enemies will randomly drop upgrades that you can assigned to your favorite weapon to increase its stats instantly..\\nThe game doesn’t slow you down my making you go into some skill tree, no... You pick up an upgrade with your equipped gun and you’ve got an upgraded gun right then and there...\\nAnd even better if you pick a duplicate while your ammo on a certain gun is still full... you also instantly get an upgrade for that weapon…\\nThis system had my actively switching guns and holding out on more rare weapons just incase I could upgrade it on the fly…\\nupgrading all of the guns in the game while still making sure you have the ammo to get the job done is a meta game itself…\\nBut the greatness ends there..\\nBecause the rest of the game is bland and repetitive…\\nThe story is hard to follow,\\nthe characters are uninteresting\\nThere are no epic moments here...\\nThere are annoying one hit instakill bosses that will have you replaying the same fight over and over…\\nevery level looks and feels pretty identical...\\na lot of grey…\\nno colors here which bores me…\\njust a bunch of repeat killing the same enemies bosses and mini bosses over and over until the credits roll…\\nI had a bit of fun with vanquish...\\nBut the expectations of the internet sorta ruined this experience for me\\nI don’t know what everyone sees in this game...\\nIt’s a good game… but not beyond just good\\nI give Vanquish a 7/10Vanquish is a mediocre game overall. Sure it feels amazing in its first hour or so, but after that the novelty of the fast gameplay fades away, the game runs out of ideas and becomes repetitive and cliche\\' as hell. Plot, setting and characters are far worse than the myriad macho movies from the 80s/90s. The only good thing in this PC port is the ability to run at 60 fps or more and up to 4K resolutions, if your hardware can manage it because Vanquish is quite demanding.Vanquish is a fun, dumb game that feels good to play when you get into a zone. If you\\'re a fan of Escape From New York or other B-grade action films, Vanquish will appeal to you as well. While I wish that Vanquish would let me fully indulge in the many joys the game has to offer, budget and time added roadblocks to the experience. For 20 dollars, I can certainly recommend this to new players or true fans of the original. But if you didn\\'t like Vanquish the first go-around, there\\'s not a lot here other than a prettier looking version of the same game from the previous generation consoles.Five Word Review: Mostly a plain old shooter.\\nFavorite Thing: It\\'s pretty action packed.\\nLeast Favorite Thing: Generic story aside, it was incomplete and it will likely never be finished.\\n\\nDate Completed: 2018-02-14\\nPlaytime: 7h\\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\nRecommendation: No. I still don\\'t like shooters and this one hasn\\'t changed my mind.Otherwise good gameplay gets interrupted every 5 seconds by boring cutscenes,\\nruining the gameflow.Vanquish almost has everything needed to create an innovative shooter that could have been more than just a couple of hours of pure, even ridiculous, entertainment. It is fun to play, but far from perfect.The most classic combination of patterns about the American style of army speech and behavior, and Japanese fanaticism on samurai and Mecha. A very intense action game with battles and gunfights on a space station-city against simple robots, powerful robots and ... boss robots. I can’t say that the game is good or bad. Rather, it is a normal representative of it\\'s genre, which I often enjoyed, but occasionally was upset with some decisions of the authors of that game.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaThis was meant for PC. It runs so beautifully. This game is perfection, the only complaint I have is that there is no multiplayer.\\n\\nA perfect comparison to this game, is Space Invaders meet 3rd person shooters.I feel that one should always enjoy games as they were meant to be played.\\n\\nI initially played this on a PS3, and hated it. The framerate destroys the experience and I despised trying to wrestle with trying to move and shoot at high velocities on a controller while the framerate tanks to 15 fps. With this PC release, and I review it at its release price, I think the game is finally fully realised.\\nNow, my experience will be a bit better than most. I\\'m lucky enough to run this game at 144 FPS, turning it into a slick, smooth experience. I\\'m using keyboard and mouse, although controller support is there. I wouldn\\'t recommend it, but it\\'s an option.\\nThe game is fun. no doubt about it. the mechanics are simple, the level design serviceable, and the weapons are good, but not amazing. However, just by adding insane mobility and slow motion,Shinji Mikami has created a fun, blazing fast arcade shooter. The story, is frankly, awful. The sections in the game that limit mobility are **** In these areas, the game falls flat and takes away all the fun the experience should be. But once you\\'re free to slide around a battlefield, nothing compares to the thrill of the gunplay. It\\'s got a decent campaign, with a few bosses sprinkled in, but normal enemies are the most fun to fight.\\nNow, you must be thinking, why give it a 10? It has loads of flaws. It has terrible story, voice acting. My reason is that unlike other releases, this was released for a low price. You could say yes, but on steam it costs the same as a much older game, such as Fallout 3. However, I would  say it would only be fair to review fallout 3 when it was released for a full 40 quid. And for that, Vanquish deserves its price tag. At 15 pounds i\\'m willing to cut it some slack. I wouldn\\'t expect any game launching at 15 pounds to have AAA quality on everything.\\nIt\\'s a great port too. runs well on my laptop and desktop. I do wish they would change a LOT of the menus so I can quickly just hop into a level and shoot the heck out of some robots. I would also like a new game plus or a god mode so I can have all the unlocked weapons to run around with.\\n\\nIf you can, get it on sale. It\\'s fun, and you\\'ll probably spend more on a night out. Stay home. Play Vanquish.\\nalso find ways to disable all the cutscenes. They\\'re all crap.A beautiful shooter from a third party.Fast, adrenaline with high reiglable.First passed on the Xbox 360, then on the PlayStation 3 and recently I went to the PC.Its time is not a bit.The gameplay will give odds to all modern shooters!- Without discounts.Even the \"cranberry\" plot in the game is appropriate and not annoying.\\nP.S.With the \"clamp\" personally, I liked management more.Passed finally.In a year.I wanted more epic, because what the topic is!Space!And in fact, just battles in the corridors.Plus a lifted complexity.In my opinion, in this genre you can find something better.But the nettle drags.+good bosses\\n+\"We capture the space station\"\\n+scale\\n-Hanous mechanics\\n-TarayaShort but fun, full of action and over the top japanese style gameplay and narrative.\\n\\nHaving previously played Metal Gear Revengeance i saw familiar things in Vanquish that inspired the Platinum\\'s Metal Gear spin off like slow motion action gameplay elements. Standard shoothing mechanics wise its decent on its own with not a huge gun variety but still with some cool and unique guns that can pack quite a punch. The way Vanquish is trying to stand out from the shooter crowd is the jet powered suit which allows you to slide across the levels with fast pace and slow down time to enter bullet time. For the most part this mechanic works and is fun to use, one issue i had was that the suit is allowed to boost only in one direction without any correction, often in the heat of combat i ended up in a wall or got stuck on objects which stopped me in my tracks. The overall gameplay is very fast paced, enemies challenging and punishing if you play carelessly. It rarely lets you explore the levels or admire the setting cuz oft he fast nature of gameplay.. There\\'s plenty of variety and difficulty level in enemy types. One annoying bit was if you get into melee range, its pretty much a death sentence for you cuz enemy melee attack is 1 hit kill.\\n\\nStory wise i dont know what to tell really, it fits the style game is pulling, if you have played japanese action games you\\'d know what to expect from it, over the top but pretty cool action scenes supplemented by much the same characters, voice acting and dialogue. Wish i could say the game has a healthy length, but i clocked in at just 4.5 hours minus the cutscenes, however on the other hand that time is well spent with lots of almost non stop action, in reality it actually feels like a longer game.\\n\\nLastly i felt the game has a reasonable learning curve, you cant master it enough in a single play through, but for me sadly i didnt felt like going back for more, dont get me wrong i enjoyed Vanquish and think its a good game, but for me personaly replay value here for me is quite minimal. What perhaps could bring me back would be a sequel that manages to improve on this original game. You can feel the game ended on bit of a cliff hanger.Vanquish is absolutely badass and if not one of a kind, but definitely very unique game. A futuristic third-person shooter with all possible from shotter classics: hordes of enemies swarming and surrounding you, wide arsenal of weapons that you can upgrade multiple times, which is only improved by furutistic aspect of the game, so you can shoot from simple weapons like shotguns and sniper rifles to an ultrasonic guns, homing rockets and lazer cannons, simple and easy-to-follow storyline.\\n\\nBut the true flavor of Vanquish is not even in this. Playing as Sam Gideon wearing an ultra-stylish and powerful power suite, you are a true Glass Cannon - incredibly fast unit with an insane firepower, but you can\\'t let enemies hit you often (or even once if you\\'re facing a huge boss). Game is greatly showing reality of war, where each bullet and move can be your last - but amazingly spiced up with technologies of the future. While playing through the levels, you can find upgrades for your weapons, making them more powerful, fast-shooting and precize. Upgrade process is smart in details as well - for example, if you have found an ammo pack for your current weapon, but your ammo is already at full, this pack will be considered as part of upgrade instead.\\n\\nEleminating your enemies and winning the roud is all about speed and tactical movement. You can spend 500 bullets trying to blow the huge robot from the front, or you can attemt a high-speed dashing maneuver, lirerally gliding under the robots feet in a blink of an eye, while he\\'s targeting your allies or moving forward to smash you - and then, land a few devastating hits to it\\'s core, finishing the business in a few seconds and giving you a savage portion of adrenaline and fun.\\nDifficulty is gradually increasing, regular enemies arriving in bigger numbers and tough enemies and bosses are always bigger, stronger and always have different arsenal of weapons and abilities to surprise you. Walkthrough and chekpoints are carefully interrupted with epic cutscenes where your hero is flying, dodging and infiltrating enemies in stylish way, bombs being dropped and whole cities being eleminated, adding more and mroe fuel to the forge of battle. After each boss defeated and battle won, I was hyped that I wanted to smoke that cigarette together with the protagonist.\\n\\nAnother part is unexpectable amount of gameplay features here and there. For example, besides shooting, Sam can perform a melee attack as well, and you\\'re pleasantly surprised when you realize that melee attack is absolutely different depending on which weapons you are wearing - you can perform a flurry of savege punches charged with energy, of peform one, but incredibly powerful stylish kick, making a flip in process. Knowing there is more than a dozens of weapon types, your arsenal of power-upped martial arts is not less fascinating.\\nEach level gives different strategical tasks where each time you need to make different approach, as well as giving you little something new here and there - for example, during one missions you\\'ll be trying to survive in a long tonne wile riding a vehicle, and to support you, this vehicle machineguns will follow YOUR and shoot when you\\'ll be shooting. You can shoot, dodge, glide, speed up and slow time when you\\'re critically injured, land explosives, heal your allies or, if you\\'re not very attentive - kill them with friendly fire as well. The battles are massive and feeling like a real hell, the characters are canonically badass, the bosses are savage and huge, and the game pace is truly outragegous.\\n\\n9/10 - I wish story mode could be really at least twice longer - I\\'ve enjoyed it to hell and back.Pros:\\n+ Salto, somersaults, Parkour-Marcur we know\\n+ passes over 8, a kind of chewing gum from the Japs, which you can go in 3 pm and go on.\\n???\\nMinuses:\\n-Gru is very not very\\nThe plot there is some kind of vooot ... We do not spit here for this.Will do.Uncovereted masterpiece.\\n\\nIt seems to be like a typical blockbuster of the PS 3/Xbox 360 era, but including a number of gam-design solutions that radically distinguish this militant from all other contemporaries.\\n\\nFirstly, a chip with high -speed movement of the protagonist, as well as the inability to passively shoot from shelter as in the legislator of all TPS of that time - GEARS of WAR, which, coupled, twists the gameplay pace of Wancwash simply to heaven and brings it closer to such quick slasers as DMC or Bayonetta .\\n\\nSecondly, bossfights. From the very beginning of the game, the game gives several interesting complex bosses, with stages, which do not take with dull spam of ordinary attacks, you need an individual approach, that is, the developers, not without success, made an attempt to cross the shooter genre with a hurricane pace of slasers, with their complex and multi -stage Boss Fit.\\n\\nAnd everything seems to be good, but ... the game of exhalation is already closer to the middle, it does not withstand the pace, which itself sets at the beginning, and this manifests itself at least that everything that this game can offer you is in The first third of the game, then there will be only repetitions and, moreover, sagging moments (like where it was necessary to play a wretched stealth, shooting lamps from the trolleys). Enemies and clashes with them are not more difficult or interesting by the end of the game, and all the bosses are killed exactly in the same way as you did with the first boss in the game, that is, even the original stages or ways of reprisals against the bosses, the developers did not think about it, not to mention already about the fact that some bosses, including the final, which is especially bad, are killed by the stupid spami of machine -gun bursts, from which the finale leaves no emotions behind, since the game after the middle is no longer able to call, turning into a light and not particularly An interesting walk.\\n\\nThe result - for the potential, speed and partly a successful attempt to realize the synthesis of a shooter with shelters with a hurricane pace of slasers - 7 out of 10.Fun on paper but boring in practice. All you do is shoot and slide. The story is forgettable and the main character is cheesyUnique in many ways, but overall experience is fairly average and forgettable.\\n\\nThe story and characters are very mediocre. Graphics/art, colors aren\\'t great.\\n\\nThe weapon upgrade system has more cons than pros.\\n\\nThere are many advanced techniques one can learn.It\\'s a Sci-Fi Third Person Shooter game which you have to find your cover while playing. Another underrated game but really fun to play. Slowing down time was really cool too. 5hrs on record.Its a badass game that is mostly fun and over the top but it sometimes fails at level design and mission structure.Vyuha is just a topical, I didn’t even expect that such a year, but the dialogs and the plot are not so hot, but they are not the main ones, the main thing here is just a reckless fast and cool gameplayIt contains one of the most interesting bosses I\\'ve ever seen.Apart from that, the gameplay and story are average, but it works.i mean it\\'s fun but don\\'t expect a mind-blowing experience , a very standard but fun gameBad port optimization and poor graphic,there is annoying bug,regret to buy this gamesGreat action shooter with a simple plot and cool heroesVanquish is a great game. Sure the story is not the best and the gameplay can be clanky sometimes. But the enemies are fun to fight against and the bosses feel fair. And the missions have some variety.\\nOverall that was a fun game with some fun mechanics and even though the gameplay was clanky, it was still fun to play.',\n",
       " 'This game is beautiful. If you\\'re looking for an experience where you can just jump into a creative world and live in it - this is it. The city is odd and dense, the inhabitants create a sense of business, and the skull floating your shoulder becomes a constant reminder that it takes effort to escape the ordinary.\\n\\nThere are very little graphical \"bugs\", screen bending is a condition that requires curing, and the flickering on posters is a part of the game\\'s atmosphere. The stalls are expensive because they\\'re catered not to you - an ordinary janitor - but to the great and brave adventurers who you would one day hope to be.\\n\\nYour first step to adventure begins in the city\\'s sewers, part of a large interconnected network of ancient dungeons, where you find your skull friend. After that, the game becomes a cure to rid yourself of the skull - while also managing the daily necessities of work and life.\\n\\nDiaries of a Spaceport Janitor is by no means for everyone. For some, it\\'s a nice place to escape to. Some enjoy the experience. Others find meaning in the strange gender-bending, trash-hording, sewer-crawling aspects of the game. For me, it\\'s something new, and it\\'s brave in what it does. You can get lost in this game. Whether you try to rid of the skull that haunts you, or simply life your life in hopes of making a more decent living, is all up to you. It\\'s a bit analogous to reality in that way. Whenever I find myself playing this game, I can\\'t help but feel a bit inspired.Quite possibly the most chill adventure game ever. Burn trash, chat with the locals, and get rid of the screaming skull (which is your only companion.)It\\'s a game that allows you to collect portraits of idol singers, automatically putting it among the all-time greats.Bad game\\nBad visuals\\nStory is bad\\nWhy this sh*t have good score?\\ndont understand, whats wrong with this scoremost overrated game ever. shiiit graphics and gameplay not worth my time. dont play this if you enjoy having a good timeI enter in this game, and my eyes flowed from these graphics. Perhaps the gameplay and the plot are good but the graphics are horribleI don\\'t like the art style and the music in the game, and it\\'s in general very un-fun to play for me, to navigate the landscape without a map and try to find who would buy my trash or whether to incinerate it. I don\\'t really understand why this is the best PC game of all time on metacritic, yes it has unique topic of fighting in poverty and gender shifting pills which is why many people rate it highly I assume, but for me it\\'s just not enough to validate rating a game highly just because it touches on touchy topics. A game should be a game first and foremost. I\\'d rate it 3 but since it\\'s way overrated as it is, I gave it zero.Mediocre thrash metal that doesn\\'t deserve such high ratings. I don\\'t know how such a large number of players, in principle, can like such a talentless and negligent project.Hot garbage compared to the unrealistic score. With added story and rework could be a nice gameKavooooooooooo, Shooooooooooooooooooo?, What is this doing here?Behind ShooooooooooooooI suspect spam or bots are responsible for this game becoming the best PC game of all time since the last time I viewed this list... Please, someone look into this. This apparently has 2300+ 100% user reviews, none of which are visible?Why is this game top 1 by user score at metacritic PC games top of all time???This game shouldn\\'t be here, i don\\'t know why it got so many positive scores.. Someone must have top bombed this game to go to the top.. It\\'s not even worth looking atThis game is a pixy craft on the knee.Gary is no more than 2 hours so you will have time to refund.Estimates are not caused.What is up with all the obviously fake 10 rating for this game? Metacritic should do something about those fake accounts that massively voted this a \"10/10 perfect game\". This game is pretty bad to be honest; it\\'s a game that wants to tell a history in the most dull and edgy way possible.If you’re the type of person who likes bizarre and different indie games and doesn’t mind getting lost or meter management, Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor is one you should definitely look into.Extremely overrated piece of trash. Very poor made pixel game. Have no idea how it got 9.7 on meta, that\\'s complete joke!Boooooooring... Veeeery boooooooring...\\nReally, i don\\'t like this game....This game was released in 2016, just six months ago it was not even in the top 200 (I personally then looked at the list in search of some kind of one), and then suddenly, for some reason, it takes off to the top 1 games on the PC for all the time. You need to be absolutely stupid so as not to understand the fact that the assessment of fake is wound by bots, because most of the reviews from users are negative, and few positive ones seem to be written by bots. Seriously, there they put 10 people for the fact that in this indie, a craft on the knee, I can quote: “burn garbage and chat with local” and “collect portraits of famous singers”. And yes, by a happy chance, all these accounts who wrote positive reviews have only one review and one assessment in the profile. And now the question is for a million, where are the gentlemen the moderators and the site administration look? = _ =\\n\\nUPD: The beginning of 2022, the game is still in the TOP 1, having almost 3,000 assessments, and only 36 comments (most of which are sharply negative, by the way in Steam at the moment it has 77% of positive reviews of 503), still the administration looks where the administration is looking atI played and I absolutely do not recommend it. The high rating probably comes from some hacker who put this game on a pedestal, and by the way, he threw The Witcher 3 (the best PC games of all time according by users score) from the throne.Obviously, some Indie-Vyser, made in 2 days, cannot have such grades.I consider it my dog to brown this fecesThis game is super BORING!!! I don\\'t get why people like it and how they can give this game a 10. This game is at max a 6.How is this fucking better witcher 3?I understand that the developers simply wrapped their estimates, but slavish.I don\\'t wanna be janitor I want a game lookin like knack and playin like knack 2. This doesn\\'t give me that. It\\'s repetitive, boring and no knackPeep out the track \"Incinerate\" from this game\\'s OST if you somehow don\\'t think it deserves a ten. I assure you it SLAPS.the claims of it being 10 is fake. it must be an April joke what blasted people\\'s ass to rate it 10. in other words don\\'t waste your god-gifted time.Most overrated game ever on meta. There must be a very very bad joke or something stupid. I really don\\'t understand that what is going on.To what extent does the administration need to go down to start deleting your ratings of comments?.\\nSpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom- better.\\nugly boring ugly boring ugly boring ugly boring ugly boring ugly boringMeh. I understand that some people may like the non-linearity of it so I won\\'t give it a low score, but it\\'s way too unstructured and chaotic and low-skill based that it turns out to be very early uninteresting.The game has a bunch of really weird graphical bugs with characters flashing in and out and the screen bending in weird ways. In a recent update they released BASIC unity options (why isn\\'t this game early access)\\n\\nI got a good way into the game. Everything in the stalls is still way too expensive for me to use but I\\'m not sure if I will ever get to use those items because I ran into a game breaking bug that deleted all my inventory items.\\n\\nEverything about this game feels unstable. That helps, but because of it I don\\'t want to get another 5 hours in and just lose all my progress again. 5 more hours of this same gameplay loop doesn\\'t sound that interesting to me. There\\'s not as much to customize about your character or environment as there are in Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. Even though you can change your gender on a whim all it becomes is just another resource with some goofy flavor text that goes along with it.\\n\\nIt\\'s in Unity so maybe mods could save this game or maybe it will get better with future updates. But as the game is upon release I can\\'t recommend it.A good attempt, discharges from the leadership of Metacricik, but you cannot pretend that the players\\' estimates are not worth the promotion of this trash.And Last of AC 2 is really such a game.And sales journalists do not change anything.And you can wind up this trash, pretending to be a rating, but no.The required information can be obtained.

Then I was able to play the game only 8 days out of the 9 nine in-game days. The reason is on Theday all the population are getting out of their homes to buy stuff & celebrate life...But I couldn\\'t share this joy of life & had to copy my save game into my laptop to be able to get past Theday. Otherwise I would suffer a drop of framerates that would make me suffer while all the residents enjoying life.\\n\\nFor that I\\'m taking 2 points from the score.\\n\\nI have spent lots of hours digging the dictionary trying to figure out which items are important to save in my inventory & which ones to incinerate...All you need is one expensive Item to keep & try to sell when the opportunity presents itself. Otherwise you won\\'t be able to beat this game.\\n\\nI have checked in Youtube and have seen that gamers did not manage to finish this game since there wasn\\'t any system & thinking behind their gameplay. In this game you are overwhelmed by the amount of vendors and items...Without a system you will loose your motivation to keep going...\\n\\nThis game is about micro-management...If you know where are your best chances are to try selling your expensive items you will beat this game fast enough. Otherwise It will be a chore spending your days trying to survive.\\n\\nEach day you must eat & trans-gender. You can\\'t save your game if you are hungry & you can\\'t read anything onscreen when the game tells you must trans-gender. If you try to get smart & buy cheap food you will vomit all over the place & can barely walk ,making you swear that you rather die then watching this scene again ...And if you think that by incinerating your vomit you are going to get paid for it the game won\\'t give you a dime for it...\\n\\nFirst thing to understand is which food is your best bet. Not only cheap one but a healthy one and available for you all around. If you managed to accomplish this you are half way to victory.\\n\\nAlso don\\'t wait for the game to tell you to trans-gender...First thing every day buy a pill of trans-gendering and be prepared...That way you won\\'t have to waste time searching for it.\\n\\nIf you go over the same routine every day you would not have so much to incinerate making you loosing money and starving to death. You must explore a variety of routines...For example each day of the week a different routine.\\n\\nYou can find items which you can exchange in the bank for money...Do that for God sake...\\n\\nAvoid at all cost the police...Each encounter with them will cost you half of your money!!\\n\\nYou start luck with -100 and you can raise it to 2,000 easily enough...Each Goddess has a specific offering candle to raise your luck. Find the shrines and base your routines around those shrines.\\n\\nAlso there are  few Lotto shrines that could give the free item to beat this game...You get one free item from EACH shrine EVERY day...That is exactly the soft spot to hit the game...So incorporate those lotto shrines in your routines every day. I have managed to beat this game only by using the lotto shrines. All you need are few expensive items and the knowledge where to sell them to beat this game.\\n\\nYou can sell only items that are currently in stock for that day....Do not waste your time on vendors and merchants that are changing their spots and the products they sell...But if you see a few merchants selling the same type of products go for it...if you try to haggle with them you will find yourself getting a worse deal...This game will not let you outsmart it...\\n\\nIf you find a merchant that is standing at the same spot every day and selling the same products, he is your best ticket to victory and incorporate him in your routines.\\n\\nYou will find many NPC that will teach you what you should do and what to avoid...Pay attention....You are almost winning now...\\n\\nThe dungeon has only one item...But each time you go there you must pay for visiting inside...So go there only when you are alert and on your best behavior. Don\\'t get dilly dally once you are starting being hunted...\\n\\nWhen you are looking to sell an item you own you can scan merchants\\' counters to check if they have what you are looking to sell ,no need to waste time interacting with them...\\n\\nIf you want to see the whole picture of what each vendor is selling just ask to trade with them & they will show all their items for selling in one comfortable screen...Don\\'t bother buying anything...They are all thieves...You get free items on the ground & from Lotto Shrines.\\n\\nDo not step on spirals, they will drain your luck...\\n\\nIf you are looking for a challenging game this game will make your brain sweat....… ExpandOh I love this game so much. When I think \"indie game,\" this is exactly what I want.\\n\\nThe world feels so big outside of the little box you\\'re constrained to, being an impoverished worker who physically and financially CANNOT interact with the promises of adventure that all of the items and NPCs hint at. You pick up these crazy weapons and spells and items, but you can\\'t make any use of them aside from selling them for 2% what they\\'re actually worth, because you\\'re a JANITOR and nothing more, and you never will be, because that\\'s how the system works. Everything feels so much bigger than you, and the first few days you spend in the spaceport just feel so overwhelming from the sheer scale of the world speeding by around you. It\\'s sort of what I imagine being an immigrant to an alien city feels like, where you know how to get by, but everything is still horribly confusing and scary and new, and you don\\'t know if you\\'re doing the best thing because nobody will help you.\\n\\nThe game is a lot more like the Souls series than most of the games that actually try to emulate FromSoft design, it\\'s got a lot to say about cycles and being caught in a sort of devastating curse that forces you to spend all day every day grinding towards a seemingly impossible goal.\\n\\n(There is one little game-breaking bug if you forget to pick up the ziggurat tablet piece, that\\'s all)The game is divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is one of the worst games ever made and the fact that some loser keeps upvoting it with fake double accounts is just awful. Metacritic should just remove this game from this site. It doesn\\'t belong even into top 4000 games list.',\n",
       " 'Very awesome game, reminds me of Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, and Dragon Age. Bringing the best of those together in a world bigger than GTA V is truly something magnificent. While also telling a very good and mature story in a beautiful setting. Ladies and Gentlemen... Let me present The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Say goodbye to life for a while! 10/10This is one of the best RPG and Open World games ever made. The sheer size of the world is breath taking and attention to detail is staggering. You could argue the graphics took a hit when looking at compressed YT clips or still images but once you play this game on PS4 in the convenience of your home on big-ass TV you will quickly delve headfirst into this immersive world and forget about the whole \\'downgrade nonesense\\'. It\\'s the most beautiful open world to date with rock solid gameplay and excellent performance ( day 1 patch is a must for frame-rate dips issues, but after that installed you\\'re good to go).\\nIf you consider Polish studio with only 200 strong staff and half the budget of EA, Ubisoft are pumping into the same crap year after year, you will quickly realize how exceptional in all aspects Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is.\\nI could go on and praise this game all day long but I have quests to do, and then some.\\n10/10 Must Buy or GTFO. ;)Amazing game with great gameplay and story. This game is while the third in the series, is still a great jumping point and CD Projekt Red has done a good job at explaining the backstory. Granted playing the other games and reading the books will allow you to get more out of it, playing this game is still a must for anyone with a ps4, xbox one or a pc strong enough to run it.This will go down as one of the best rpg\\'s ever created.  It\\'s mind blowing in scope and quality and very refreshing to have an adult oriented rpg.  This is a harsh, realistic and brutal worldThe best RPG i have ever played. Amazing character creation. Nicely designed quests. Very rich bestiary. World map is very big and full of content. Almost no loading screens!Best RPG game ever ! Large diverse open world , mass quests, addictive gameplay . For such a game I waited and did not deceived. Congratulations to the Polish developer.This is officially the best game of all time! It\\'s beautiful, combat is perfection and everything was  created so incredibly that I would want to live in this world forever! Reality has become obsolete now!;-)Thanks CD projekt red ! You are by far the best game developer in history! Love you all!!;-)A masterpiece of a game , I havent had such a long enjoyable RPG experience since the early 2000s ! there needs to be more games of this calibre . 10/10 .Ive have only played this game for some 22 hours now, and I haven\\'t even left the starting area yet. Im simply in awe of the beauty of this game, constantly finding myself just starring at the screen and the changing environment. I haven\\'t seen this much attention to detail since GTA V, and that is the only other game on the current gen consoles i would give a 10. If you enjoy games like Skyrim and Bloodborne you need this game!Awesome game, nice graph, awesome storyline and voiceover. Controls can be more responsive, but is good camera in fight can be better.. If you looking cool story, and fights this game its for you!Fantastic game, the world is so dynamic and huge it\\'s truly incredible. There is alot of stuff to do, the characters are interesting and the plot as in all games is great. If you\\'re an RPG fan than you should immediately  get this game!May I call The Witcher 3 \"Adult version of Dragon Age Inquisition\\'\\'? Or same level as Skyrim? Because of the amazing story, fantastic living open world. I\\'m going to spent hundreds of hours into this game ^^One of the best games ever made. Swimming mechanics need some tweaking, but this is not enough to rid it of a deserved 10/10. A masterpiece of art and gameplay.This is not only great game but also, a great story! It is deep and exciting without \"fedex\\' quests. That\\' is something that for example Dragon Age definately was missing.Take a bit of Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, The Wolf Among Us and add following ingrediences: most beautiful and dense open World ever created, hard but rewarding combat and the most memorable side quests ever created from which many are dramatic storylines on its own. This masterpiece is what you get!THE WITCHER III: WILD HUNT is an absolute must-play-before-death game. an epic story with fascinating and compelling characters (thanks to powerful voice talents), fantastic gameplay, stunning and jaw-dropping graphics, great music and .... I mean, what more does a game need to get a 10 ot of 10?\\nThe Witcher 3 is by far the best action/rpg you have ever experienced in your life. DO NOT hesitate in buying TW3:WH for one second cause it\\'s worth it to be on anyone\\'s collection.Bugs are transitory, fame will be eternal. Witcher 3 is an amazing looking game with clever plot and living, colorful world full of interesting characters and places to explore.Awesome game with a lot of nice features. Its a must have all of you who love RPGs. Graphics, fighting, exploring, mature storyline, a lot of quests, monsters. Its a must have.Down grade? Oh i don\\'t think so lol! With about 8 hrs of play so far i\\'ve not had 1 crash. The game is beautiful\\nand even on my pc i7 2600k 3.4 speed boosted to 3.8  with a gtx 760 4 gig mem card and 16 mem i am running it on high. I am loving the voice acting and the music. And good news for people who never played The Witcher series, they have a good tutorial to help you out with combat and well everything. This is going to keep me busy for a long time! This game is going to break a lot of records.Cdpr Gongrats a bunch im literally inside this game never felt like that on any game! One thing I\\'d love for use to do if Yous read piss EA off in battlefield there nothing but money hungry **** frostbite have told them to sail off to Kingdom cum that game is ruined and frostbite know that!! Yous guys are legends why! Because yous are in for us and there in for money the witcher 3 omg mate yous nailed it in every aspect! Your out in the middle of bum gee nowhere nek minute there\\'s bandits around a fire it\\'s unreal everything about it this game has nothing to with skyrim why do pple think that totally different.this game is 3 time amazing and best RPG game ever i playing.  story, graphic, gameplay/combat and voice acting are top Notch. there are some weird glitches during gameplay like my horse got stuck against fence that it can\\'t get out of fence. framerate sometimes dip during cutscenes and gameplay. i recommend this game to everyone : this game is worth 60 bucksAn extraordinary game with stunning visuals and details. Great storytelling, fun RPG elements and a breathtaking atmosphere. A good example what a \\'\\'next gen\\'\\' game should be!This is not only great game but also, a great story! It is deep and exciting without \"fedex\\' quests. That\\' is something that for example Dragon Age definately was missing.One of the best games I ever played. Beautiful graphics, compelling story, addictive game play, large and diverse open world, perfect combat, a lot of interesting side quests. I have to take few days off now...Beautiful world. Mature gameplay and story.True next gen. RPG. Recommended to all B&G I and II, PTorrment, Fallout 1,2 fans.  Deserved 10 out of 10. With free DLCs this game will get only better overtime.I haven\\'t even opened the box yet and I\\'m excited. Giving it 10/10 cause it has horses in it. What also helps is that Geralt seems to have a beard in this one, and I am a fan of beards. I find them comforting.One of the best RPGs I\\'ve played by far makes skyrim and dragon age inquestition look awful if you haven\\'t got it already I highly recommend you do it\\'s full of content that will keep you from going out doors for daysAfter reading so many good reviews I was stoked for this game...Do not be tricked people this game is weak. The play control is absolute garbage, it\\'s super clunky and sloppy. Compare it to Shadows of Mordor and you\\'ll see what good controls should be like. The menus are way too complicated for them doing nothing. The voice acting is so cliche and lame. Every character in the game looks like they had liquid wax poured all over their bodies. Everything in the game is tiny. The fighting is clunky and non-responsive.I would have honestly given this a 5/10, but since it was so ridiculously over hyped, for so long, that I bought it thinking it would be a solid time sink an entire year after it\\'s release, this review is going to be a brutally honest tear down of this second string game.\\n\\nThis game is awful, controls are sloppy, combat is arduous, easily glitch exploited, and uninspiring. Leveling, and thus skill unlocks, are tied to main quests making the game droll and needlessly open world. Every vendor gets an often pointless cut scene. I can carry hundreds of reagents (needlessly) but only alcohol and meditation is necessary to craft after the initial production.  Objects have weight, but there seems to be no purpose to it as a constraint at all.\\n\\nThe game plays like an old \"choose your own adventure\" book, only with long uninspired, and awkward, walks through areas you are punished for exploring.\\n\\nThere is extremely low experience for killing random world monsters (each kill within experience range will net you approximately 0.4% of a level which is worse than individual mob killing in WoW and each kill takes much longer)  which removes a good deal of interest from exploring the \"open world.\"\\n\\nThis is combined with the oppressive finance system which actually punishes you for exploring and killing \"the monster curse that still  haunts the countryside.\"\\n\\nAs an example of the terrible implementation of finance: a sword sells for less than a piece of bread costs, repair costs are imbalanced however you can always sell tons of needless herbs for a gold a piece (if you enjoy running circles around overly populated herbs that have to be in L.O.S. of the third person camera AND in front of your character to collect).\\n\\nCombat is a game of attrition, heavily dependent on holding down parry, rolling, and waiting for stamina cooldowns (could be more entertaining on face roll difficulties but I wouldn\\'t know). There is no real \"out of combat\" engaging as ranged weapons do no damage of any import, enemies are obviously tethered and easily exploited for it, enemies typically attack in packs which throws out the counter mechanic most of the time, dodge is inferior to roll against packs and equally as useless as counter.\\n\\nThere is no functionally new, clever combat in the game, but there is tons of rehashed combat concepts from other games that have been horribly reused here.\\n\\nThe game is overly controlled to give purpose to poor implementation: missing reagents for recipes to prompt you forward, poor experience for not following the story, a poor economy to constrain your trade and attempt to limit your roaming due to the high cost/low reward of killing monsters despite easy (boring) exploits to circumnavigate it.\\n\\nThe graphics aren\\'t great for ps4, the game repeatedly failed to maintain a proper render before patching: either slowly degrading textures, or failing to display loot images, or parts of the HUD, and once dumping half of the polygons for the world littering black boxes in straight lines.\\n\\nEven after its 20+gig patch monsters often glitch below ground and pop back up, climbing over barriers rarely looks correct other than hopping fences, and additionally the text is unreasonably small and useless on my 40\" tv 9 ft from my face....\\n\\nThe story is choppy and terse due to the interactive implementation, not to mention forced and puerile. I\\'d honestly skip it if there was any other redeeming quality to the game, but there isn\\'t.\\n\\nI could go on. There is no way I would have released this game as is, and there is little or no chance I would consider buying another title from this producer.\\n\\nI should have researched it more online, but after a year I was foolishly confident it was a solid bet given its high price point and visibility. I haven\\'t been this disappointed since Dragon\\'s Dogma, and I think it was even worse this go around.What a staggering disappointment.\\nFirst off: The controls of Geralt is an abomination.\\n\\nEveryone do this test; Watch how in his first two steps after you first push on the controller, they are really slow steps, and then he moves into stride - It\\'s terrible. What precision and control is possible with that ?\\nThen this test: run straight and then immediately push directly left or right on your gamepad - after that turn, Geralt stops slowly, turns like a slow moving robot, and then moves again. It\\'s insane.\\nThe basis of the main characters movement has gigantic flaws that makes this game unplayable.\\nNot only that but all his movement is sugglish and non-resonsive, and when the combat is difficulty already, it makes the gameplay in the Witcher 3 an exercise in endless frustration. And it was built this way. AMAZING.\\n\\nThe players animation when on rocks, against trees, sliding down a hill etc, is all terrible. The physical connection of Geralt to this nice looking world when exploring, is awful.\\n\\nIf they fixed the controls, the combat would still be really boring. None of the early enemies showed much intelligence or proved an interesting or visceral fight. Hit by weapon animation when you hit the enemies leaves no strong impact, and the AI behaviour in combat very soon into the game feels very repetitive. Sure you have some strategy with the Signs, but it\\'s still in a dull combat system against plain enemies.\\n\\nThe positive: is that some of the writing is vastly improved from the Witcher 2, and even most games.\\nBut you have to spend such a long time traversing what is a pretty nice designed world, but that setting quality is still not high enough on it\\'s own and for all that imposed length extending traversal imperative, or as compensation for the really poor controls and gameplay.A large, diverse open world, lots of quests and absolutely stunning graphics. What\\'s not to love? Well, I hate to say it, but the graphics in Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are merely a lipstick-on-a-pig distraction. What the graphics will ultimately fail to do is make you forget the fact that the combat mechanics are absolutely terrible. Much of the combat in-game is purely based on timing.\\n\\nThe average gamer is going to love how the game looks, but hate how it plays. RPG\\'s live and die  by how well their combat system is received, and this game\\'s combat system is an unintuitive, poorly-timed and oddly-keystroked mess.\\n\\nSee all those good reviews? I\\'m pretty sure they\\'re all just too mesmerized by how good the graphics look. It\\'s a shame the way you interface with them is such a turd.I still play this game to date. And every time i play it through i find new things to be amazed of. Truly a masterpiece!Witcher 3\\'s combat gameplay is just horrible, i just bought it because everyone is praising it.\\nGameplay is medicore at best to be honest. I agree with people saying Witcher 3 have good story. But what good is story if the gameplay sucks. Might as well be watching a movie then? When it comes to games, GAMEPLAY is more important than STORY.This game have the same problem as Bioshock Infinite. As good as people say it is. The story is all it is good for. The combat is lackluster and I would rather watch Bioshock Infinite as a movie than play the game. I would rather watch people play the game than playing it myself.\\n\\nThis is coming from a guy who enjoys Dark Souls, Monster Hunter series, God Eater, etc.\\n\\nAnd we all know how much dodging and rolling there is in games like Monster Hunter.\\nBut Witcher 3\\'s rolling is just.. Unsatisfying, overly obsessive rolling and spinning.\\nMonster Hunter\\'s rolling = precise timing to dodge a hit that would otherwise kill you. Rolling eats up your stamina bar so every roll has it\\'s purpose.\\nWitcher 3\\'s rolling = You might as well be the Tasmanian Devil. Because spinning and rolling is the new style. I think Geralt is dancing and spinning like a fool when he attacks and its always the same.\\nHe does switch the swords automaticly in this game.\\n\\nCAMERA while fighting is the worst CAMERA i have ever seen in a videogame, really and this game has such a high rating?\\nStory is good, but for the most part people are talking nonsense when you speak with them.\\ngraphics have a downgrade but are still looking good.\\nthis game is a let down like destiny, the order and watchdogs to be honest and it doesnt live up to the hype.\\nMy hopes are Batman and MGS5.Most of the things in this game are very good.. BUT!!!!! The camera and controls in general, are just unbelievably bad. It is clumsy and unprecisly, makes it a little difficult to loot sometimes, some fight combats looks a bit ugly because of it, and it is just enoying that you run around/running into things and people like a confussed animal or something. If you have played the buggy Assasins Creed then you probably know little about how it feels like.\\n\\nIt irritates me, cause this game got so much potentiale. It have potential of course, but the bad controls just ruins the experience a bit. I really dont see the point about making a game with that much content, without making some of the most important basic things optimal. It feels like the game is unfinished, and i would LOVE if they could patch this problem, then it would be a really good game.World is big yet boring, there is too much of the same stuff. Combat is too repetitive. Text is too small. Geralt has a bad voice.  Stroy is full of cliche stuff. An immensely overhyped game. Expected something more original.WOW... to say I was excited about this game is an understatement. I know 1 is a low score and this is based purely on the broken and choppy movement/camera\\n\\nDO NOT BUY THIS BEFORE PLAYING SOMEONE ELSES COPY OR RENTING.\\n\\nI really tried to love it... I gave it 3 hours of gameplay before I couldn\\'t take any more. At first I thought there was lag or similar... the videos were choppy and the gameplay jerky. The gameplay is only slightly choppy but it ruins the whole experience. How on earth anyone can rate this game highly is beyond me. I went to a friends house and their game played the same. This would be a great game if the choppy/jerky camera was sorted out. It is going back tomorrow and is the biggest disappointment of the year for me.\\n\\nIf they had saved the money spent on the \\'free extra crap\\' and spent it on development this could have been epic. Alas no though.There is nothing special about this game other than the dialogue choice mechanic. The world is the same as in any western RPG, and the gameplay is the embodiment of averageness. Most players will be amazed by its graphics and the fact that the world is huge, but that doesn\\'t change the fact it consists of unimaginative forests, mountains and swamps. The enemy designs are equally unimaginative, and the combat system you fight them with is dodge and hit with no strategy involved.What an unmitigated piece of crap ! Controls and mechanics from the 1990\\'s were enough for me to stop after an hour and ask for a refund on this overhyped nonsense.It\\'s Herald!  It\\'s a Witch! What could be more beautiful when your favorite character from the book moves to a quality game?!If any game deserves a 10/10, it is The Witcher 3. The content in this game is massive, perhaps infinite. I certainly lacked the capacity to finish all the side missions. The amount of voice work and motion capture is truly incredible. This game puts others to shame.\\n\\nThe gameplay is also fun in a beat-em up kind of way. The game lets you play with different styles and I chose fast and agile. By the final boss, I felt like I was playing on easy mode. Animations could have been smoother for the protagonist but then I say that about every game.\\n\\nThe inventory system was the only negative. This was a real throwback to a bad time in inventory and shop management. It would be better to leave all the rusty swords on the ground and let the protagonist focus on the story. It\\'s a small to pay, though, for such a gorgeous game.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t played the Witcher 3, you are missing out on the best game this generation. I guarantee it.Witcher 3 redefines the open world RPG genre. This is the game of a generation. I cannot think of enough adjectives and superlatives to do this game justice. Refined, Polished, Thoughtful, Witty, Gritty, Complex, Awe-inspiring.. and so much more.\\n\\nEvery side-quest defies your expectations. There are no mindless fetch quests in this game. from my experience. I enjoyed every single side quest and monster contract I took on. Every single one. Which is really rare...because i have come to expect LESS from game companies these days after a series of \"AAA\" disappointments from North American studios.\\n\\nJust when you think you know where the sub-plot in a quest is going, it takes a twist. And another twist. And you are faced with REAL, CONSEQUENTIAL decisions. Not the meaningless **** decisions that have zero effect on the game world you will find in Bethesda\\'s Fallout 4.\\n\\nConsider this, I have not played any previous Witcher games, and I have no idea what a Witcher even was before playing this game. However it completely drew me in. I couldn\\'t stop playing. I think I\\'ve put in more than 50-60 hours playing at a leisurely pace, and finished the main story and all the main side quests. Yet I have explore only 25-30% of the OPEN world portion of the game. There are VAST forests and caverns with interesting, useful loot, and monsters roaming the wilds that I have yet to kill.\\n\\nI cannot say enough good things about this game. Maybe because I\\'ve been so disappointed by the shallow, soulless \"products\" made by North American studios: Fallout 4, Diablo 3, Farcry 4, WatchDogs,Really good game, would recommend. Don\\'t spoil yourself with trailer and stuff like that, just try it!Best game I\\'ve played all year, maybe in the last 5 years.  Absolutely amazing.  CD Projekt Red succeeded in creating a living breathing world that I got completely lost in in the best way possible. Open world games are often sorely lacking in story, but not the Witcher 3 where a side quest is more interesting than most entire games.  Only flaw would be the ending left something to be desired, it wasn\\'t bad but not very memorable either.  Either way, the game is a masterpiece. Gameplay, story, character development, graphics, and sound. It excels in every department.  This year has been great for gaming (personally),  Bloodborne, Batman AC, and now this, but Witcher 3 has slain them all.The best RPG and Open World game ever made! Great story and storytelling, great side quests, great characters, great monsters, great open world, everything is great in the Witcher world!\\n10/10Absolute masterpiece on every level possible. More i play it, more i start liking it. Highly recommended!Genuinely superb, the writing is of such a high calibre that any current technical issues, such as the dipping frame-rate in some of the denser areas of the map, can be easily overlooked. The depth of consequence from a single line of dialogue that isn\\'t apparent at the time is staggering.  With the recent patches, numerous free DLC and promised New Game +, Witcher 3 is easily one of the top contenders for Game of the Year.This game is a masterpiece. Arguably the greatest video game ever made. Gameplay, story, graphics, sound design & almost every other category gets 10.An epic journey from star to end. The sort of game that makes the industry and the fans proud. No need to go into details, everything is top notch. Must buy and must keep.This is probably one of the best games I played the last years! I think everything else has been already said by other users. Just brilliant!I loved this game from the beginning to the end.There are few moments that give you a feeling of being filled, since each story, even the secondary schools, are very elaborate.\\nOne of the best games of this generation.I don\\'t give out many 10s but you\\'ll struggle to find a better rpg on the PS4, or any system for that matter. Huge, immersive and challenging. The combat is tough at first but once you get the hang of it things get easier. That\\'s not to say you won\\'t get yr ass kicked if you don\\'t keep your wits about you. Great characters, loads of quests (main, secondary, treasure hunts, contacts). Very very enjoyable.I think it\\'s fair to say that the Western open-world genre has become quite formulaic over the years. Yet, with The Witcher 3, developer CD Projekt Red proves that it\\'s still possible to have a seriously amazing experience without necessarily innovating the genre\\'s tried-and-true foundations.\\n\\nThe game puts you on the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher (monster hunter) who roams the Northern Realms in search of Cirilla, his foster daughter, who is being chased by a supernatural army called the Wild Hunt. Having not played any of the previous titles, I found myself initially intimidated by the storyline background; luckily, the game\\'s tale is written in such a way that you can mostly ignore the finer details of Geralt\\'s previous sagas if you want to.\\n\\nThe story itself is likely to please fantasy fans. It is a fittingly epic tale which uses the invasion of the Northern Realms by the southern Nildgaardian empire as a background, and it\\'s reasonably fun and interesting. It does have its fair share of clichés and at least a couple of significant dei ex-machina (I\\'m looking at you, Dudu the Doppler) that render it hard to be taken entirely seriously as a piece of adult-oriented storytelling, however.\\n\\nIn his adventure, Geralt roams several open spaces through the Northern Realms. The landscapes look absolutely gorgeous, filled with impressive lighting effects and extremely detailed textures. One of my favorite aspects of the setting is how it mixes traditional fantasy with a bit of horror, leading to some pretty scary enemies and scenarios, but without resorting to cheap jump-scares.\\n\\nThere is a lot of ground to cover in the several open-world environments, with numerous towns, villages, sidequests and hidden secrets to keep you busy. Roaming the land in search of experience and loot is extremely satisfying, thanks in good part to the intuitive controls and the fluid action (no, there\\'s not a single quick-time event to tell of, thank you very much). Like any good RPG, there are also extensive options to craft and/or buy gear, weapon, potions and assorted items, which manage to be intricate without getting overwheming.\\n\\nThere is only one significant deviation from this formula: gwent, a simple strategy card game, played by Geralt and several NPCs, in which you amass an army (represented by separate character cards) and control the weather to defeat opponents. As basic as it is, it\\'s a surprisingly addictive little diversion, and sometimes I found myself setting the main adventure aside just to wind off against NPCs and win new cards.\\n\\nBasically, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt plays brilliantly, looks gorgeous, and offers dozens upon dozens of hours for you to lose yourself in its very appealing brand of horror-tinged fantasy. With its compelling world, an equipment/potion/addon system that is deep yet easy to grasp, and a set of main quest missions that doesn\\'t try to break its own boundaries in annoying ways, you have one of the best releases of the year for fans of epic adventures.\\n\\nRating: 9.0This game is a masterpiece! If you choose to do all the side quests and treasure hunts you will end up with hundreds of hours of intense and exciting game play in a vast rich world!\\n\\nCDPROJEKTRED gives lessos on making a great game with a lot of love and awesome support and bug correction.\\n\\nThis is a must have. Enjoy the ride.Amazing game with awesome story. Best RPG game so far. Breathtaking views, dozens of quests and points of interest. Funny and interesting hidden references to the book by A. Sapkowski. Every quest is unique so you literally can\\'t get bored. Many characters, love affairs and the great Gwent as a pretty complex mini-game. Your decisions are important as the story go on. Best ~300 hours of video gaming.Not long ago the second and final DLC for the Witcher 3 was released. In honor of that, I\\'m doing a long-overdue review of the whole game, including both DLCs. First of all, the DLCs each play as separate campaigns of significant length. The first could be completed just before the end of the main Wild Hunt campaign (but is best done post-game), the second should definitely be post-game. With that out of the way ...\\n\\nI have not played Witcher 1 or 2 (mainly because they were not on Playstation), and I wish I had. Because this game is EPIC. Not only does the main campaign feature an amazing story, each of the two side campaigns have their own unique stories which are maybe even more compelling than the main plot.\\n\\nThe Witcher takes place in a pseudo-European, dark fantasy world based on books by the same name. A long time ago this world overlapped with others in an event called the Conjunction of Spheres. A bunch of creatures from those other worlds became trapped in our world. Some of these are elves and such, but most are vampires. To fight these, people created witchers--mutant monster hunters with superhuman abilities. Only later, they decided witchers were kind of like monsters too, and they hated them. Until they need one.\\n\\nThe world is deliciously dark--which I love--and draws a lot of inspiration from Slavic mythology. It\\'s not all Slavic myth, though. You have other fantasy/myth staples here and there, like djinn and so forth.\\n\\nIt\\'s a massively open world reminiscent of Skyrim. I mean HUGE, with so many places to explore, quests to complete, and monsters to hunt you could basically invest a bazillion hours into the game and not do everything.\\n\\nGameplay took a little getting used to at first. Once I got the hang of it (hint, dodge monsters, parry humans), though, it ran fairly smoothly. I played it mostly as a swordsman, but you can customize Geralt to focus more on alchemy or signs (magic) and all styles of play are intended to be effective. The DLC introduces further options for customization and even a use for ability points once you have otherwise reached the cap.\\n\\nI played on the medium difficulty, which only occasionally proved challenging. The combat system was rewarding and never grew tedious.\\n\\nWhat I think I liked even more than that, though, was the plot. Witcher stars Geralt and occasionally his adopted daughter Ciri. It also gives a lot of time and development to numerous NPCs in ways that make your choices seem like they actually matter. In this way, the game is somewhat reminiscent of Dragon Age games, though I found the story more compelling in Witcher. Unlike in the former, I never got bored in dialog with NPCs, never felt compelled to skip ahead.\\n\\nI highly recommend this game. 10 out of 10.This game is my favorite game of the generation, followed closely by Red Dead Redemption 2. It\\'s as close to a \"masterpiece\" as I\\'ve ever seen or played. The world is so deep with lore and a sense of place, that until RDR2 I\\'d never seen before. The storytelling and characters are also among the most memorable and beloved in any game I\\'ve experienced. The gameplay is smooth and never stopped being fun. I played on Death March difficulty and the game provided a good amount of challenge. The combat isn\\'t as deep as in the Souls games but it\\'s still better than in most RPGs. I enjoyed it a lot. The quality of the side quests is second to none and represents the standard by which I judge all similar games. I spent over 500 hours in the main game alone, not even counting the expansions, and it enraptured and captivated me the whole time and in a way very few games have.Let me start by saying I understand why everyone enjoys this game so much, to where it got a \"#4 Best PS4 Game of 2015\". As someone who didn\\'t play it in 2015, and played it for the first time in 2019, this review is through my eyes.\\n\\nThe story starts with a slow build and overstimulating tutorial which starts the trail on rocky footing. I learned most of my basics while in the middle of a forest between side-quests, which may be the best part of the game.\\n\\nThe characters are well designed and the world is well planned, it\\'s just a shame the same isn\\'t said for the basic mechanics of the game. The controls and character movement feels loose, travel and interaction with the world is unpolished at best, and combat is nearly a nightmare.\\n\\nPerhaps i\\'m better off with 2015 goggles without current greats like \"Spiderman\" and \"God of War\" to compare it to, but maybe it\\'s time for a sequel and tighten up the loose bolts on this nearly immersive game.An all time classic right here. The characters are so well written that they are real to me. Main characters Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri are so complex and their chemistry together is so touching. I just finished playing Blood and Wine and have truly seen the end to Geralt\\'s journey, which is very bitter yet sweet at the same time. My only worry now is whether or not I\\'ll be able to enjoy another action/ adventure as I played the best of the best. Must buy. Thank me later.Witcher 3 is quite possibly the best Action RPG game of all time. There are so many elements at play here that other games just can\\'t compare. With a fluent fighting system, deep engaging story lines & side quests, and a visually astonishing environments and character detail....its easy to see why it belongs in the history pages of greatest games of our age!An absolute masterpiece and experience to own. Great writing, gameplay, characters, quests, main story all set within a vast rich compelling world that both old and new fans are sure to enjoy!One of PS4\\'s best game for sure I throughly enjoyed it the combat was super especially the controls, Story and graphics. Great conclusions and boss fights for the finale\\'s geralt of riva story.  Must buy for PS4 owners and the expansions pass was worth it.Not a huge rpg fan but I\\'m more than happy with my purchase. This game is definitely crafted with care, and it shows in its huge, dense world, intriguing characters and quests, and attention to detail. This is the first game where I\\'ve felt like the world is truly alive. The combat is tricky, but it encourages planning ahead and practicing which adds yet another dimension to an already amazing experienceOne of the best RPGs i\\'ve ever played, a deeply emotional plot storyline, awesome cast of characters, Contracts are probably one of the most amazing side-quests that i\\'ve ever played, and of course an vast open world with a lot to do and to investigate, and a perfect sountrack... A few visual bugs, but nothing to seriously, i recommend to every RPG fan.This game is amazing! it truely represents how an actual roleplaying game should be, every minor decision you make will affect the result of the story further on (and the story is very good), sidequest always lead you to various surprises and are fun to play, and althoug you cant create your character it\\'s feels really good roleplaying with Geralt, you really have the liberty to make your own Geralt with different personalities. I was really on the spot about this game because I was deciding if I should buy this or Fallout 4, and I dont regret it, every minute of my playthrough was worth the price, this is truely an awesome RPG, if not one of the best RPG (one problem tho, controlling Geralt feels clunky and hard)There is power!\\n\\nI soaked in this game right away.History, characters, gameplay, and above all a huge open world full of amazing side missions.Must play for every RPG fanOne of the most beautiful games i have ever played, the level of detail is outstanding. The storytelling and the characters are wonderfully elaborated and the world is so real that you actually feel you are in the game. Few games manage to do that. A must-play for sureA masterpiece by any standard. This game combines the best parts of any open world RPG to create a stunning, large, and breathtaking journey. Characters are deep and their motivations are realistic.\\n\\nIn addition the world is perfect. It feels real and lived in- more so than any other open world I have seen. The main thing that sets it apart is your role within that world. In games like Skyrim or Dragon age you ARE the world. The many factions of the world of Skyrim/DA revolve around you and your decisions. This is not the case in the witcher. Rather than being the focus of the world you are but a mere piece of the puzzle. You have an effect on the world, but a realistic effect at that. You control nothing, you simply play your part and that is amazing.My favourite game of 2015, besides BloodBorne. It really deserves all the praises that people are talking about! Very good game and gameplay! Thank you CD Projekt!I don\\'t ever write reviews but I can\\'t ignore the fact that I have so much love for this game and I don\\'t tell someone about it. At first learning how to move and fight took a little learning but once you get used to it you feel very tactical and patient in fights waiting for the opportune time to get a hit or 2 in. It really makes you take each encounter seriously and cautiously. The story is the best I\\'ve seen in a game and it is really easy to get attached to characters. The facial expressions and attention to detail in this game is stellar. The amount of content is mind blowing. The map is huge and there are countless quests each feeling connected to the world. I rarely play through games more than once because I know what going to happen already but I am playing new game plus after my first play through and I haven\\'t lost any motivation or drive to continue. I am over 200 hours in and I haven\\'t play either expansion pack yet. This is not something I say lightly, but this may be the best game I\\'ve ever played.Absolutely magical. The Witcher 3 is outright the best game of 2015. From the stunning scenery, intriguing lore, awesome soundtrack, fantastic beasts, epic combat, amazing character development and one of the best video game stories ever told, the game exceeds all expectations. It is a game dripping in atmosphere and colour and I found myself more immersed in the world and lore of the Witcher 3 than any game I\\'ve ever played.The Witcher 3 is set in a fantasy medieval land with the Nilfgaard army invading the land, playing as Geralt you must find your one time ward Ciri and defeat the Wild Hunt, a group of elves from a different dimension trying to capture Ciri. This incredibly beautiful open world is fantastically presented and I found myself frequently making use of the ps4\\'s share button to upload screenshots of the incredible scenery. The main storyline is one to be remembered for years as it keeps you interested at all times and is very easy to follow, even allowing you to make your own decisions in order to change the outcome of the game as well as causing changes to specific characters and even communities. If you weren\\'t told otherwise, you\\'d think side quests were a part of the main story, with some side quests significantly affecting what happens to some characters, such as who will be the king/queen of Skellige or what will happen to King Radovid. Scavenger hunts and witcher contracts provide a nice alternative to the main story for a bit of money or to help level up your character. CD Projekt RED clearly didn\\'t become lazy when creating side quests as they are excellent. One of the amazing things that CD Projekt RED did was allow new players (such as myself) to fully understand the lore of the game and the background of the characters despite the fact that this is the third game in its series. As is almost a requirement for any RPG game is a good combat system, and The Witcher 3 does not disappoint, simple fast attacks and heavy attacks make up the general swordplay but the use of rolls, dodges and parries allow for a more complex defensive part of combat and the addition of magic elements such as bombs, oils, potions and signs fulfills the RPG aspect of the game. General enemies are simple to take down, yet not at all repetitive and the boss battles are something else, huge elves known as the Wild Hunt make up the main bosses, wearing badass armour and having a huge amount of health combined with unique abilities such as teleporting or summoning elementals keep you on your toes and alert at all times make for some of the best boss fights I\\'ve ever seen. Sticking with the subject, the end battle is magnificent with not one but two bosses and the combination of fighting as both Ciri and Geralt adds an original twist to the already spectacular game. The only things that could be altered with this game are the occasionally glitchy movement system, often you\\'ll find yourself unable to open a chest or loot a body and the walking and running can sometimes feel unnatural. As well as this, as somewhat of a newcomer to RPGs, at the beginning of the game I found it slightly difficult to fully understand some elements of the game such as magic items and the ability trees and so would recommend taking your time at the beginning to make sure you read the tutorials and completely understand them. In conclusion, this game completely amazed me, the incredible amount of content that is in this game is phenomenal and every aspect can\\'t be faulted. It is definitely one of the best, if not the best game I have ever played and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The lack of multiplayer may deter some gamers however anyone will enjoy The Witcher 3, regardless of whether they usually prefer multiplayer or singleplayer. I have given The Witcher 3 a score of 10 because of the following reasons:\\n\\nStrengths:\\n- Fantastic storyline\\n- Impressive graphics\\n- Interesting, exciting side quests\\n- Highly entertaining boss battles\\n- Good combat system\\n\\nWeaknesses:\\n- Occasional glitches\\n- Unnatural movementW3 is the first installment of the Witcher series I\\'ve ever played and I just continue to be blown away by how great it is. There are few games for consoles these days where you actually feel like you get an entire game for $60 (looking at you Bungie!), and this game gives you that and so much more. This is one of the first games I\\'ve actually been excited about DLC and I\\'m sure it will be worth. Fantastic RPG any way you look at it.After experiencing Witcher 2 on the Xbox 360 I was hesitant to jump back into the world of Geralt of Rivea. I wasn\\'t the biggest fan of the combat at the time and felt that the multiple aspects had a hard time transitioning to the console. However after having a drought in games to play I decided to jump into Witcher 3 a few months after launch, and it was the biggest mistake I could have made because I should have got it on Day 1. Even before inserting the disc into the game I was greeted with an insert from the developer thanking me for giving there a game a chance by purchasing it. Never before have I as a consumer, in any form of entertainment or product, felt that the people who worked on something truly valued the support I was giving them. But back to the game itself. For whatever reason I decided to play the game on the hardest difficulty, which I completely recommend of anyone whose played any open world game or rpg like Skyrim or Red Dead, and was pretty much stopped in my tracks by any horde of enemies. However the most pleasure from this game is in the preparation required to defeat enemies using such as signs, potions and oils to defeat enemies. Overcoming a hard boss that you\\'ve prepared for or finishing a long string of quests to unfold more of the story in Witcher 3 brings more excitement then I\\'ve ever felt for a game before, and that\\'s because of the incredibly detailed open world rivaling the likes of The Elder Scrolls and Grand Theft Auto. Even the mini game of Gwent has become a phenomenon in itself and I feel heavily compelled to play every npc in this card game just so i can get access to new rare cards, an online component would have been amazing, but a separate game such as on the app store, the PlayStation store or Xbox marketplace would be an instant purchase for me. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a 10 out of 10 for me, its a beautifully detailed open world rpg that deserves a look.What an amazing game!!!. So I don\\'t usually write reviews but I finished playing this game about 2 weeks ago and thought it was really good. Then I picked up fallout 4 (what a mistake) and it truly helped me realize how amazing this game is. The graphics are superb I\\'ve never seen a game that made me be proud I have a nextgen system as much as this game did. The voice acting is pretty good (it took me a bit to get over geralt sounding like batman though). The body languange and facial expressions are what make interacting with people so good though. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a movie instead of playing a game.\\nThis game has some serious glitches though an elusive gwent card glitch make it nearly impossible to get the \"collect em all trophy\" making a platinum sometimes completely impossible. There is quest where you get locked into a dungeon and seriously your only way out is using a different glitch. The horse mechanics are kinda clunky. Sometimes I sheathe my sword in the middle of battle which can get really frustrating. This happens a lot when I\\'m fighting humanoid creatures like dongs and monsters at the same time and have to switch between swords. Well sometimes I sheathe one and never pull out the other. I\\'ve had quests that don\\'t complete the way they should too.\\nThat being said this game is freaking so fun. I absolutely loved the gwent side game what a blast. I wish fallout 4 were half as good as this game..... or if walmart had a better return policy on video games but thats for a different rant. If you haven\\'t played this game  you need to it\\'s the most enjoyable single player experience I\\'ve had on a nextgen console. Lastly you can\\'t go wrong when you put in a pair (or a hundred) of real ta tas lol. Honestly this title must have put the ESRB through the ringer. Anyway this game is freaking amazing play it they play it again they get the dlc and play that.It\\'s been months since I played The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt so it is with a clear mind that I can say this is the best RPG ever created.  So many excellent quests, even side quests are better than most games main quests.  Excellent combat choices keep the game fresh.  Great story, great graphics.  There isn\\'t one weakness to speak of.When I first brought The Witcher 3 on release I was worried I\\'d be overwhelmed by how big this game is and how much there is to do, but after a couple of hours I was fully immersed in the lore of The Witcher, wondering off to uncover the secrets of this world and then realsing I\\'ve just bought one of the best games I\\'ve played. The Witcher 3 has become an example of what open world RPG\\'s should be like. There isn\\'t one section of land in this game which feels like it\\'s been copied and pasted from somewhere else, or rushed together. The buildings, towns and cities have been built into the landscape, but gives you the feel of being transported into another world, which strangley feels real (even though you\\'re fighting Griffins and casting magical signs!). I loved every second of The Witcher 3 and even though I was sad to come to the end of the main story, I quickly realised I still had much more to do. The only small negative I have is that I felt like I was leveling too quickly towards the end of the game, which made me feel a bit over powed, even though I was at the recommended level for that particular quest and I also felt that the inventory screen could\\'ve been better thought out (even after the patch which changed this screen). Overall, I love The Witcher 3 and I\\'ll be playing it for a long time.The pinnacle of AAA titles in 2015.\\n\\nI got this game back around whenever it was released and could never really get into it. I put it on the back burner for a few months, and tried again. Once again, couldn\\'t get into it. I then got consumed into Fallout 4 for a bit but got quickly bored of it. This weekend, after being disgusted with the amount of critical acclaim the Witcher achieved over Fallout 4, I decided to do intense research and practice with the game and I will say it is incredible. Better than Fallout 4 in nearly every aspect.\\n\\nWriting: Honestly one of the best quests I have ever played. The writing is fantastic, the quests are fun, emotional, and somtimes, funny. The characters are also quite good. I love the personalities in particular of Geralt and the Baron.\\n\\nGraphical: The graphics are nice. Water is very well done. The lighting and environment is very nice. Nothing unique per se, just realistic medieval and wilderness graphics. The monsters and armors are very creative; some look cool as **** (Wild Hunt Armor), and some look downright disgusting (Rotfiends, Botchlings).\\n\\nTechnical: The game runs at 1080p, 30 FPS on the PS4, typical with many console games. The combat is decent, the only really bad thing I have to say, but it is still quite good. It requires strategy rather than hacking the **** out of someone as say the Elder Scrolls. Movement can be a bit sticky too, I\\'ve accidentally fallen off of ledges quite a bit.\\n\\nOverall: So damn good. You will probably love it if you\\'re patient and willing to learn in the game and outside of the game (YouTube, Reddit).Without a doubt the greatest game of all time! The game is just so good right from the start and just doesn\\'t stop, the environment is amazing being one of the only games I felt completely immersed in, the characters were awesome especially the bloody baron who gave off a Robert Baratheon type fell, there are 100\\'s of hours worth of stuff to do and the side quests are amazing. Now the stuff I just talked about is just the tip of the ice berg about how good the game is so just go out and buy it and I think you to will see that this game is the best game of all timeThe most awarded game of all time and well deserved. Without a doubt The Witcher 3 is the best game I have ever played. My only wish is that I could forget everything about this game just so I could have that feeling of playing through it for the first time again.Best game I\\'ve ever played, surprising. Living, exciting soundtrack, engaging history, very well developed universe, bestiario and so on. I could improve combat.Game masterpiece!Just the best game of all times and peoples.What graphics, what a graphone!There are very few games quite like the Witcher out there. This installation is a game changer for RPG\\'s. I have never enjoyed an open world like this since Dragon Age Inquisition, it\\'s purely magnificent on every level.Honestly, one of the best gaming experiences of my life.  An amazing world with side quests that felt like pieces of the main story as opposed to fetch or follow missions.  I am not sure if I logged more hours playing gwent or the actual game.When people say this is the best game ever made, they\\'re not lying. It truly is! The game doesn\\'t have a scripted story, it\\'s based on your choices but no matter which path you take it feels emotional and engaging. The game makes you feel so many different emotions ranging from happiness, curiosity to fear and sadness and many more. It\\'s open world is one of the largest and the most beautiful but it never feels empty, the soundtrack is the best I\\'ve ever heard in a video game. The combat is fun, even though the enemies should have had more varied move sets and it lacks the hardcore challenge even at the highest difficulty. This is the only thing they could have done better. The game is worth a buy in 2019 and it will be for many years.The most spiritual RPG of the existing ones.The world and the adventure that really delayed you and create a very strong connection with the characters.What has never happened in TES (maybe with the exception of Morrowind).Gunter, perhaps at the moment, is the best negative character in the game industry in general.I can’t put 10 only because I did not like the second DLC at all, not my atmosphere.Amazing game and one of the greatest RPG games of all time. Wonderful story to keep you entertained from start to finish, great memorable characters and an awesome fantasy world to keep you immersed for tons of hours, It is by far one of the best gaming experiences that I ever had.This is not a game. It\\'s a masterpiece on every aspect of it. Excellent story, gameplay, graphics.Addictive.One of the best RPG ever and one of the best games in general.Masterpiece!Lets start this review by stating that this game is a masterpiece, i give it a 9.7/10.Quest Design: The Quest designer of this game did an incredible job at making this game. It contains a wide verity of quests that all feel unique and intresting. No quest feels like ur just doing it to check boxes and even items to fetch like that Pan for that old lady have a story behind it.Story: The game\\'s story is complex and intresting. All major events in the game are shown to the player and even important conversations ( the Ciri Stories) are played rather that told through a conversation between Geralt and the Baron. All of the charecters are interesting and have their own unique personalities. Same goes with the NPC\\'s.The Open World: The Open World is not only huge but filled with things to do. You go off the beaten track and will find a unique charecter, sword or enemy to fight. In one of playthroughs i ran into a new sword cuz i went to Heatherton before finishing the beast of white orchard.Gameplay: All of the enemies fight differently and have unique patterns. The progression mechanics never feel like a grind. The combat isnt the smoothest part of the game but lt works and if u like RPG\\'s u wont feel like it mattersMicro transactions: CDPR is one of the most consumer friendly devs available. There are no microtransactions and numerous free DLC\\'s. There 2 paid dlcs but u can get both for 10 dollars and get more than 40 hours of more content in a game with more than 300 hours of contentOverall i believe anyone shud try the game as they shall enjoy it. Hope u liked the review and have fun playing.… ExpandThe best game in the world.Cool plot. Good RPG component.And there is sex ... ExpandA masterpiece of a game , I havent had such a long enjoyable RPG experience since the early 2000s ! there needs to be more games of this calibre . 10/10 .Masterpiece. Awsome game with a lot of nice features. Its a must have all of you who love RPGs.Fantastic!Quality story and captivating characters.World rich in content.The most positive point is the richness of the characters and the interaction between them.It is the best game that I have tried in my life, its map, the locations, the story, its DLCs, the graph that although it was not what we expected has a graph at the height, the final bosses, and others!FUCK!This game has almost everything, it is true that sometimes is bucked (not much, only occasionally) and sometimes it is half coarsus, but that does not take away the title (for me) of the best RPG and next to RDR2 of the best gameof the generationthank you cd projekt red you have done an amazing game. I will  always rememberd it.... the music and characters  are wonderfull the world is the  most bigger in ps4. the story is incredible the enemies are so much.. the secondary missions are the best i haver ever played in a videogame.. believe me this game deserves 10Amazing in all regards: story; characters; huge, interesting, life-like world; combat; crafting system; equipment and loot; graphics; music; etc.  The main thing that surprised me was just how well-written and interesting even \"mundane\" side quest could be.  I particularly enjoyed a side quest called \"A Greedy God\" and was completely blow away by the Hearts of Stone DLC (especially the part where Geralt goes to a wedding - hilarious!!!!!!!!).  This game is a must play for all rpg fans out there.Very well crafted. Increadible graphics, optimized for pc.\\nThe main quest could have been 20% shorter, though.\\nThe game is more a choose-you-own adventure, and it explores the human condition through substance abuse, greed, fear, exploitastion.\\nThis isn\\'t really a sandbox, crafty, do-whatever-you-want game.\\nI\\'ve read the books and played the previous games and for me the game was great value for money and time invested.While people go on and on about how great Skyrim is, they\\'re overlooking this absolute treat of an RPG that can be bought for a little bit of nothing.  I only played the vanilla version with no expansion and there is so much content it is completely unimaginable to finish this game.  Plus, the graphics and fighting system are much more modernized than Skyrim, which at its release was just a simple rehash of Oblivion.This game came out 2 years ago...and still towers high  above other titles that came out today.\\n\\nI\\'m just gonna point out the good things and the bad.\\n\\nThe Good: The game is enormous, the world full of little details, tons and tons of quests,npc\\'s.\\nlandmarks, big cities (similar to Assassins creed...expect the world isn\\'t empty like those crap games\\nI bet you can take all 21 Assassins creed games together, and it still won\\'t have as much content as The Witcher 3.\\nYou can easily spent hundreds of hours in this game especially on higher difficulties (and there is New Game +)\\nThe story and characters are done really well, every quest has in-game cinematic\\'s and are fully voiced....it makes make you feel more emerged in the world and more connected to the characters.\\nThe graphic are amazing, it\\'s the closest things to a believable living breathing world.\\nAnd i don\\'t know any game that has surpassed this game graphical wise  (maybe Horizon zero dawn?)\\n\\nThe Bad:  Well not necessarily bad but i think the combat could have been done allot better, it can feel akward and buggy at times...it\\'s a bit similar to assassins creed and Batman combat.\\nBut it does feel satisfying to chop off heads and limbs in slowmotion.\\n\\nBugs! Well most of the game breaking bugs have been fixed by know...but like all open-world games it\\'s never gonna be bug free! so expect to see some weird things from time to time.\\n\\nVerdict: Really worth picking up, don\\'t hesitate.\\n\\nPS: If the game gets too easy at some point you can allow low level mobs to auto-scale with your level, so now every fight takes longer than 5 seconds....you can toggle this on in the options menu (took a while before i found out)The Witcher 3 is simply an amazing game. It\\'s as near to a perfect game as I\\'ve ever played the only flaw is that the combat can get somewhat repetitive but that is an extremely minor flaw as the many different missions and sub-stories keep it from getting as repetitive as Skyrim (also a great game but it suffers more from the repetitive flaw).\\n\\nBattle System: 8.5/10: It\\'s a lot of fun and you feel like you\\'ve got solid control over your character. It can be a little button-mashy at times but for the most part not in a negative way. A very solid 3rd person battle system.\\n\\nGraphics/World Design: 10/10. The world is beautiful and there are many rich regions to explore each complete with their own lore. The main story is great but the secondary tales that flesh out each region are so good you sometimes forget to continue on with the main story. Truly The Witcher 3 manages to craft a world that you want to dive head first into. The graphics are also quite good. Everything you\\'d expect from a PS4 game.\\n\\nSoundtrack: 9.5/10. Honestly my only complaint about the soundtrack is that we don\\'t hear the music more often. The music is good and fits the game nothing is overly epic for the battle you are having and it works to draw you more into the game.\\n\\nStory: 10/10. The story and the sub-stories are great. In fact the open world sub-stores are so good that they can end up distracting you from the main story! Despite this each subplot feels like it has purpose and your decisions in how you approach these can effect the overall story. Also the ability to play both as Gareth and Ciri adds an extra touch of greatness to the story.\\n\\nSide Quests/Bonus Material: 9.5/10 It\\'s great as I\\'ve said already. The extra stories are awesome. The witcher contracts get a little repetitive but they all have individual stories so it is bearable and you still feel accomplished completing each one.\\n\\nMisc: Pretty much all covered above. All else I can mention is the crafting system which is easy to use and very useful and I would give it a 9.5/10 as well.\\n\\nSummery: The only bad thing about The Witcher 3 is that I didn\\'t play it earlier. It truly is a great game and does the open world right without sacrificing story. There are few things I feel it could have done better.\\n\\nOverall score: 10/10',\n",
       " 'For some reason, I couldn\\'t really get into this game as much as I wanted to. The story was good but I found myself getting bored of repeated, similar encounters and getting lost on occasion. I personally didn\\'t really get into the story until the final third. The hint system was a nice touch for someone like me who does get lost easily and I think more games should have this option.Overrated game. The gameplay is not fun. People may enjoy the story but this is just something that I don\\'t want to replay because of its depressing themes.It’s tired and cliche, everything it tries, it fails at. One of the worst games I’ve ever played, only beaten by its sequel it terms of how bad it isPretty boring game where you go from point A to point B. While there are some moments where it feels like it\\'s worth it, but in the beginning of second game some ugly woman just kills you and that\\'s what i call very bad writing. Avoid, if you actually like good games.General Overview: Fantastic story, smooth graphics and flawless game play.  I am a PS4 convert so I can\\'t comment on the prior console version vs. this one, but as a new player experiencing it, this is as good as it gets for post apocalyptic games that use a zombie-esque  theme.  Voice acting is tremendous, the story is captivating and multi-player is fun and well designed.  All in all a must play game in my book.\\n\\nTL;DNR: 10 - superb, smooth graphics, great game play, exciting and challenging combat; tremendous atmosphere and immersion; well written dialogue and excellent story telling all around.  One of the best games ever created.  However, if you have the PS3 version I am not able to comment on any level of improvement, but this current version, for someone new to the PS4 I can say that this is a must play game.\\n\\nTechnology/engine:  Super smooth graphics, excellent game play supported by flawless optimization.  Use the dual shock very well and nothing feels forced or superfluous.\\n\\nAI: Great AI with significant behavior variations keeping the game tense and fluid.\\n\\nGraphics: 10 - Absolutely stunning at 60 FPS and 1080p.\\n\\nSound: Excellent ambient noise and great source to distance recognition.  Sound plays a HUGE role in the game and it is very well implemented.\\n\\nSoundtrack: 10 - Very fitting music that adds to the intensity and immersion of the game.\\n\\nVoice acting: 10 - Excellent acting all around.  Very well delivered dialogue and great moments of small levity in this harsh and cruel future.\\n\\nCrafting: 10 - Very well implemented with just the right amount of scarcity of resources.  Crafting can turn the tide of a confrontation, which is how it should.\\n\\nCustomization: 10 - there is no real variation in appearance but the skill system allows you to augment how you enjoy playing.  Its another well designed a  feature that really adds to the game overall.\\n\\nGameplay systems 10 - Great stealth, excellent combat utilizing melee, guns and traps and forcing a player to think ahead and execute a plan of attack with few if any flaws.\\n\\nControls: 10 - Great use of the Dualshock controller and integration of the central touch pad.\\n\\nStory: 10 - It is not often that you come across a game with such a deep and well told narrative.  If you love games for the stories that they tell, this one is a must play and is in the ranks of Ragnar Tornquist, Kirkman, Ken Levine and other great narrative story tellers of game development.\\n\\nMultiplayer: 10 - well balanced and fun to play.I played, I could not play in Ps 3 for different reasons and there was hardlyThey say if you didn\\'t play it on PS3 is a must haveThe Last of Us is masterpiece  it is must play. Some say it is \\'\\'Overrated\" in my opinion they are wrong this is unforgettable  game one of a kind.Even if you played Ps3 version , Ps4 upgrade is worth it.\\n\\n10/10This is pretty much the same game I loved on the Ps3 but now on Ps4. The Ps4 version is the same with just upgraded graphics. The online is the same and the story is. So why shouldn\\'t I give it the same score as the Ps3 version? Well some critics/users might say it didn\\'t offer us anything different; well yes they\\'re right not much different things are offered as it is a REMASTERED edition. Not a reboot or Last of us 2...\\nThough Naughty Dog did release some great news, way to keep people playing it. Naughty Dog had said they are releasing New The last of us DLC. Not single player dlc but multiplayer (which I personally love). TBH, anyone who played it on the ps3 should give it pretty much the same score or better (if you were that guy that gave it 9 because of the graphics o.0 ) Hope people would agree with me as it is an honest review.When you stand at the top of the heap with this quality, people are looking to take aim.  Is it perfect?  Nothing in life is, but it\\'s the closest product to being perfect most will experience.  Is it for everyone?  Not necessarily, but  you\\'d be avoiding a game that defended a generation and one that deserves a look.  It is intense, it is funny, it is all the things any great piece of entertainment should be like.  People will ultimately form new greatest of lists in the future and it\\'s most certain that this will be on all of those lists.The last of us is such an amazing experience and looks incredible on ps4. I\\'m happy that they rereleased it so I can have what I think was the best game of last generation for ps4. There is definitely a difference in the game and it runs and looks so beautiful.  I am mostly happy that people that never had a ps3 are able to play and experience this game for the first time. I have always had every system but some of my buddy\\'s only had 360 last gen and got ps4 this gen and bought it yesterday and are already hooked. I definitely recommend you try and and play all the way through to see the incredible endingGreat Story  With Characters You Can Get Attached To , Great Remastered Graphics , A Ton Of Collectibles To Pick Up ,  Decent Price Tag , What More Can You Want In A Game , Naughty Dog Does It Again First Uncharted Series Now Last Of Us ...After finishing this game, it will be hard to find another game to enjoy.  This is truly one of the best games ever made. Kudos to Naughty Dog for creating a masterpiece.What can you say about the greatest game of last generation come to PS4, and looking and playing better than ever? The game is amazing, and must be played PERIOD!The Original Was Amazing – This One is Even Better\\n\\nThe Last of Us became a generation defining title when it launched last year on PlayStation 3, and many would go even further to say that it was instantly one of the best games of all time.  Statements like that are hard to argue against when The Last of Us is now the most awarded game in history by critics.  I fall right into that camp: before playing The Last of Us for the first time, I had never considered a game to be worthy of a 10/10 score.  As immersive as a game may be, as beautiful as it may look, or as gripping as the story may be, I’ve always believed that there will be enough problems to keep games off of the perfect score pedestal.  The Last of Us shattered that belief.\\n\\nThe Last of Us: Remastered is the exact same game the original was a year ago.  However, it also includes all of the DLC, was upgraded to run at 1080p and 60fps, and includes a photo mode that lets players act like they are using Instagram in the game’s post pandemic setting.\\n\\nWhat all of this meant for me is quite simple — The Last of Us: Remastered instantly overtook the throne of best game I have ever played.  Sure, I will never get the first playthrough reaction again because I know what is going to happen, but does that take away from just how incredible this game is?  Absolutely not.  Recently, one of the writers here at Middle Of Nowhere Gaming made a bold claim that The Last of Us actually gets better the more you play it, unlike most other games.  And you know what? He is completely right; it really does.\\n\\nJust how much better could a remastered version be?  Well, let’s talk about just how beautiful TLOU: Remastered really is.  If you played the original on PlayStation 3, you will immediately be able to tell the difference just by watching the opening cutscenes.  Joel and Sarah look much sharper than they used to, and the camera moves around like it’s a feather floating on the wind.  Do you think I am sugarcoating or exaggerating?  I’m not.\\n\\nHowever, even though Remastered looks and feels exponentially better than its source material, there are minor hiccups here and there.  One problem I ran into was that I felt motion sick each time I had to sprint during the first hour or two of the game.  I am by no means a tech-genius, so I can’t say I understand exactly what affects the change from 30fps to 60fps can have on people, but it made me feel sick several times.  But it’s not all bad!  If you decide to stick it out with 60fps instead of locking it back at 30 you will almost certainly grow accustomed to it with time.  It took me about two or three hours to finally shake the feeling.  On top of that, 60fps makes the gunplay so much better.  The combat felt faster and tighter — something that Naughty Dog’s gunfights are not usually known for.\\n\\nThe only other issue I had with the graphics was the occasional glitch where people would run through walls, get stuck running in place, etc.  This kind of thing happens in just about every game if you look hard enough, so it should be taken lightly because it didn’t happen often.\\n\\nNaughty Dog’s decision to add a photo mode to TLOU: Remastered was a very smart move.  What better way to show off all the hard work and dedication the team put into this game than adding the ability to snap awesome photos of the many incredible sights/scenes found in the game?  On top of this, they added the option to add filters to each photo you take, making it feel just like Instagram.  We live in a society where the masses are hungry to share, like, and comment on as much content as possible; Naughty Dog knew this, and it’s why it was such an important addition.\\n\\nAll of that said, the best part about Remastered may be that it includes the Left Behind DLC and two multiplayer map packs for less than the original price when when the game was released WITHOUT the extra content last year.  Left Behind is a heartwrenching flashback story about Ellie that players will now be able to play whenever they want (preferably after beating the main story). The multiplayer maps were really fun to play on, especially since it runs much smoother graphically now than it used to.\\n\\nThe Verdict: 10 out of 10\\n\\nThe Last of Us: Remastered is by far the best game I have played on PlayStation 4 so far, and I now consider it the best game I have ever played.  If you still only have a PlayStation 3, the original version will suite you just fine, as it still holds up incredibly well.  However, if you own a PlayStation 4, you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing the Remastered version.  The graphics are so noticeably better that you will see the difference right away, and the additions of the photo mode and all of the DLC make the package seem criminally underpriced.  Do yourself a favor and get this game.  You’d be hard pressed to find a prettier game that also has one of the best stories ever told in any format.This game is fantastic! Great story, very good multiplayer and breathtaking graphics. It\\'s one of the best games I have ever played in my life! For me 11/10!I missed this game last year, as I only had heard good stuff about it I had extremely high expectations.\\nBut Last of Us delivered and lived up to it\\'s promises. Im looking forward to the new, downloadable content later on today.\\n\\nAll though I can\\'t compare it with last years\\' release, here\\'s my review.\\n\\nStory: 9/10\\nGameplay 10/10\\nMusic 10/10\\nGraphics 9/10\\n\\nThe graphics aren\\'t as good as Infamous or UFC, but it\\'s the best game on PS4 so far. A must buy.This game is a simple masterpiece story,graphics,character developing, acting, gameplay, Multiplayer...everything is superb and now you can enjoy it in 1080p/60fps!!!\\nThe pricing which everyone is nagging about is completely fine if you imagine a copy of the PS3 version of the game costs around 35 bucks + 15 bucks (left behind) = 50 bucks...now the PS4 version costs exactly the same...50 bucks...Naughty Dog revamps this game to the fullest. Between the heartfelt story, competitive online play and challenging trophies there is something for everyone to get hooked on this beautiful game. I have no regrets buying this game for both the PS3 and PS4. Best game I\\'ve played in an extremely long time.For the a-holes that gave this game a bad score. You suck. Rate it as if it was the first time you played it. They didn\\'t tell you to go buy it again!!! Its the best game on the PS4 thus farThere is only a few games I missed Last Generation and The Last of Us was the one I wanted to play the most. I am a huge fan of the Uncharted games and Naughty Dog\\'s great cinematic experiences and character driven focus that they have presented in the last 7 Years.\\n\\nThe upgrades to 1080p and 60 FPS should be reason enough to call this remastered, but Naughty Dog has included all of its previous DLC and updates which gives you a more than the Value of the game and should give reason to the Non-DLC gamers out there to have a better (and maybe even a new) experience with a more complete game.\\n\\nI am sure for those who have already put more than 30 Hours into the PS3 version will have a hard time recommitting to \"Game of the Year\" edition (so to speak), but it shouldn\\'t cause the game to receive lower ratings.\\n\\nThis game is simply put as such, if you LOVED the game on the PS3, then owning a more complete version with better overall performance (at a $25 trade-in rate at Gamestop) is a No-brainer. If you have NOT played this game, it is a highly cinematic, stealth, action, horror game that will surely give any gamer an amazing experience and worth every penny. If  you played the PS3 version and felt like you already experienced everything there is to offer, than there is not much purpose in re-buying it.Amazing game on all fronts. Thrilling and sweeping. Tells a great story and backs it up with solid gameplay. A couple repetitive moments but otherwise almost perfect. 9.5/10\\n\\n720 comments! How ironic. ;P.Amazing game. The Last of Us finally justifies buying the PS4. Didn\\'t play it on PS3 and it looks awesome. The story is so comparable to The Road / The Walking Dead. Amazing mechanics. Overall a genius of a game!Was more than glad to pick this one up again especially now on next gen, with now 1080p 60fps single and multiplayer plus a new difficulty mode called grounded. For anybody who never had the chance to play The Last Of Us on PS3 I recommend getting it, I consider this game to be the consoles best game or at least a great contender for the best game of its generation. Not only is the single player top notch the multiplayer is indept and addictive too.I enjoy games with a strong story the most and this is like playing a movie. The difference between the PS3 and PS4 version is like playing on VHS and now on Blu Ray. This is now my favourite game on PS4. For those that have not played it ever this is the best version, if you aren\\'t the kind of person who will re-buy a favourite film on Blu-Ray then you may want to skip as there\\'s not a lot new.Last of us is one of the best game of the year and one of the best in a generation. And finally she gets to the ps4. This game contains all of the best of the movies and games. Continuing the good tradition of the companyThe Last of Us has its minor problems such as occasional unintelligent AI moments, which for the most part can easily be fixed by increasing the game\\'s difficulty. Story is linear, but well written, and the level design is fantastic seeing that there are many different ways for you to tackle down areas with enemies, keeping the game from becoming stale and repetitive.Throughout my play-through there was never a moment where I didn\\'t care for a character, all characters in the game where significant and unique. Not to mention the remastered edition comes with all the dlc and multiplayer maps previously released on the last gen console all for $50.\\n\\nNOTE: I have a PS3 but decided to wait for this game to come out for the PS4 seeing how many good reviews there are for it, it was obvious there were going to release it again for next gen and I was willing to wait, and I must say it is quite worth the wait.After finishing \"The Last of Us Part II\", there\\'s almost nothing redeeming left for me in the first game. Everything became soulless now. Sad.The Last of Us is impeccably crafted and overall a well done game. It\\'s called anything from a masterpiece to the greatest game people have played, but this is the remaster, so I\\'m going to focus on how worth it it is to pick up for a first, as well as a second play through.\\n\\nIf you have never played this game before, buy it. This game will give you more hours and higher quality gameplay than almost any other for the cost. The replay value, multiplayer, free DLC and difficulty are enough to warrant the purchase, but if you already owned it on PS3...\\n\\nBuy it again. In order to see why this game is worth picking up a second time, let\\'s look at what \"Remastered\" actually means. 49 dollars gets you:\\n\\n- 30 dollars worth of DLC bundled in free.\\n- Improved visuals, shadows, framerate (60 fps), textures, etc.\\n- Dualshock 4 integration. Audio logs can now be played via the controller instead of needing to stay in the menu, the light bar signals how low your health is, etc.\\n- FULL LENGTH making of documentary included.\\n- Directors commentary optional during cut scenes, includes other voice actors as well.\\n- Photo mode.\\n- Hardest difficulty mode that used to be DLC now included as well as being accessible for first play throughs.\\n- Advanced audio options finally.\\n-Multiplayer boost for Ps3 owners.\\n\\nSo for 49 dollars, you get 30 dollars worth of DLC, a full length documentary, a multiplayer boost, a new difficulty available instantly... and then after that you add on the remastered visuals and audio.\\n\\nThis game features new game plus, high difficulties, engaging and unique multiplayer, engaging and free DLC and now it comes packed with interested special features. All for less money than other games on the system. It\\'s the best bang for your buck for the PS4, even for returning players. This isn\\'t just a remaster, it\\'s how all remasters should be done.Truly Amazing game.  Everything that I loved in the PS3 version of this game is even better now.  Amazing Single Player, fantastic Multiplayer, and all the DLC included in the price.  This has quickly become my favorite game over even Red Dead redemption.  I love all the characters.i do not owe a PS3 so it is my first time playing this game and it is one of the best game I have ever played.\\n\\nsuch intense story and gameplay! the graphics and voice overs are very professional too! highly recommended for all!Anything less than a perfect score would be ludicrous. The Last Of Us: Remastered revitalises the original game, allowing it to reach new heights of superiority [...] The Last Of Us is less a video game, and more a spiritual experience. 5*so glad that this came out as remaster edition for next gen as I have jumped from X360 to PS4, I was so hyped about this title and now have a chance to play this masterpiece...everything in this game is amazing, starting with story line, through gameplay and visuals...one of the best games Ive played, a must play for anyone who did not play the ps3 version and think still a nice come back for those who enjoyed it last year.What was already an amazing game is made even more amazing with the addition of enhanced graphic and the inclusion of all of its DLC! Also very impressive was the inclusion of new pathways through levels and some new camera angles! For more what makes The Last of Us my personal favorite game of all time please see my Playstation 3 review!This is the best videogame i ever play in a long time, the last generation was so bad not because the games was bad, is because the companies becomes greedy as hell for the fault of creation of microsoft, the  DLC\\'s.One prove of that is capcom. Releasing incomplete games whit a lot  of \"DCL\\'s\" that are already on the disc. But another thing, i don\\'t understand why angry xbox one fanboys came here to give a bad verdict to the game and crying like baby\\'s, this console\\'s war is useless and worst than the other generations.quite simply incredible.....such intense story and gameplay! the graphics and voice overs are very professional too! highly recommended for all! .....Everything is perfect.\\nHistory, characters, music, control..... simply awesome.\\n1080p and 60 frames looks a new game and looks as game creating for PS4. Just awesome.Never before has there been a game to evoke emotion the way TLOU does. The quality of acting would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame and the storyline had me hooked from the first second to the last. A true masterpiece deserving of every accolade being given and a must have for any collection.\\nAll in all, TLOU Remastered is, in my opinion, the best game ever made.Another half -mouth game from Sony, people suck on the emotional and sincerely tearful plot, terrible gameplay (when it has), I preferred to see a Pelé movie.Uninteresting/bad story. No character development (just cause characters talk a lot, doesn\\'t mean there\\'s anything new about them, in the end we still have zero idea what Joel has done past years). Basically all this crafting/looting/fighting zombies had already been done in Dead Island (2011) and Resident Evil games, so it\\'s nothing new either. Overall hard pass from me.This is simply the best game I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nStory: 11/10\\n\\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\nGraphics: 10/10\\n\\nMusic/Sounds: 10/10\\n\\nGameplay (crafting, survival etc.): 9/10\\n\\nEverybody who rates this game 5 or less is just stupid. Just because they think, that this game is overrated, they give it a bad score.\\n\\n\"Overrated\". Even if it\\'s so, the game is still genius and it doesn\\'t deserve such bad ratings.\\n\\n(Sorry for my bad english, I\\'m german.)Perfect, beautiful game, it was great, now it\\'s perfect, the story and very moving, because it fucked with our heads, a lot of fun, and the multiplayer and a lot of show,First off, I am a 30 year old gamer with all consoles (Wii U, PS4, XB1), handhelds (Vita and 3DS), and a high end PC (Dual GTX 780 SLI).  I\\'ve been gaming since the days of Atari and have owned nearly every major console since and I have a collection of roughly 800 games from 80s to present day.  The Last of Us is by far one of the best games I have ever played in my life.  It is an absolute masterpiece that will blow away even the highest of expectations.  Everything about the game is stellar - story, graphics, sound, acting, and gameplay.  If you consider yourself a \"gamer\" then you must play this, it simply can not be missed.  The Last of Us will become a true classic and will be remember and talked about until the end of time.  Anyone who says this game is \"overrated\" is a troll that hasn\\'t played it and most likely watched 5 minutes of youtube gameplay.  Bottom line is this is one of the best single player experiences ever and won\\'t be topped for a long long time to come.I\\'ve been a PC gamer for the majority of my life and I really wanted to try this game out. I just never wanted to spend the money on a console (ps3). During the release of the PS4, it made sense to hop on board, due to the amount of exclusives that Sony has. This is by far one of the best single-player games I\\'ve ever played in my lifetime. This is up there with Half-Life (insert all the expansions), Half-Life 2, Bioshock, and many others.Why does this game is getting such bad reviews by some ?\\nSalty much ?\\n\\nAnyways, if you\\'ve already played the game on your PS3, you might not be interested by this Remastered Edition, even though the visual upgrade is important.\\nBut if you never owned a PS3 or never played this game, this is a must have.\\n\\nFirst of all, it\\'s absolutely gorgeous. The art direction is phenomenal, the views are stunning, the characters look great... This is indeed a beautiful looking game.\\nFurthermore, its performance is a real plus. The PS3 version suffers from framerate dips down to the 20s. The lowest I\\'ve experienced on this game must\\'ve been around 45-50 fps, during really intense moments (bloaters, for example. Loads of particle effects involved.).\\nBut for the most part, about 98% of the time, it runs at a solid 60fps.\\n\\nThe gameplay is great, the fist fights are really intense, and the shooting, usually pretty rare, and always short, is really well done.\\n\\nBut if there is a main reason to play this game, it\\'s its story. It\\'s absolutely phenomenal. The characters are formidable (just try to hate them... oh wait, you can\\'t), the pacing is great and fits the game\\'s atmosphere perfectly, there are some really intense moments... This is a truely great game. One that will be remembered for all the good reasons.\\n\\nOf course some people hate on it. But well, it seems to be a trend with PS exclusives...\\n\\nAnyways, a serious 10/10. A must have.\\nAnd as I said, if you already played it, except is you\\'re a hardcore fan are are dying to play it again, don\\'t buy it. The game hasn\\'t changed.\\nBut if you haven\\'t, just freaking go for it. The hell are you waiting for ?\\n\\nAlso, there is a photo mode. It\\'s a gimmick, but it\\'s a nice plus, and allows us to make great screenshots.\\n\\n10/10, nuff said. Best game in a while.Amazing Game, Perfect history, and a good gameplay, NaughtDog has a perfect game I mean that I had such a connection with the characters, that at the end of it, I felt like I needed more of the game, i´m hope play a sequelThe 1080p Makes a HUGE difference! The graphics are amazing! The action is no 60 pfs which makes it super smooth as well! Its like playing the game all over again!Like it or not, The Last of Us is an undeniable masterpiece, despite some minor shortcomings in it\\'s combat.\\nIts immersive story, incredible characters and heart wrenching writing made for one of, if not THE best PS3 game of all time... And now, it\\'s undoubtably the PlayStation 4\\'s best title, and will probably remain that for a long while.Amazing storyline. Amazing gameplay. Amazing graphics. Amazing audio.\\n\\nTL;DR: Game is amazing.\\n\\nP.S. I never played the PS3 version, but I am enjoying this game so much so far!While it may not seem like much, 1080p resolution and 60 fps are very welcome improvements for a nearly perfect game. Naughty Dog managed to do a flawless technical adaptation for the PlayStation 4. We would have loved a bit more extra content, but we can\\'t complain, as the game already is one of the best ever created for a Sony platform.just perfect, as something that was already so good can be even better, worth every penny invested whether or not you played the version of ps3.A Naughty Dog is awesome.This is my first time playing the game, having missed out on the ps3 version.\\nAll I can say is wow. At all times the immersive storyline and gameplay keeps you wanting more, at no point do you want to put that remote down. Rarely have I played a game that is so engaging with the user. Your emotions are taken on a roller coaster from finally managing to escape an area to getting to the next dark turn and hearing clickers somewhere in the distance that puts your heart in your mouth. It is incredibly intense. At 60 frames the combat  mechanics is incredibly smooth and it absolutely has to be, you can\\'t afford to waste a bullet. Now the big debate, do you buy this for the ps4? As a new player, absolutely no debate. It\\'s a must have. If you own it on ps3? I could see why players would want to return to this game, if not now chances are a few month or years down the line. I gave this game  a 10 because it\\'s everything a game should beIf you played this game on the PS3 as I did, you will enjoy it all over again! The Remastered graphics are exactly that, Remastered and very nice. When compared to the PS3 version you can definitely tell the difference. The Last of Us must be in any conversation about the best video games of all times. The story is excellent, you will find yourself caring about the characters and want to know how the story ends.  The shooting is fantastic and it plays both all out combat and stealth elements brilliantly. I am not one of those type of gamers, that gets a game and plays it for hours straight until I beat a game. It usually takes me several weeks to finish a game as I don\\'t have the luxury of playing for 12 hours at a time. But even though I had already played through the game once on the PS3, I found myself looking at the clock at work, so I could get home and play for a few hours. This game will do the same to you. It is a must play if you like video games. Great job Naughty Dog.Great game. Moving over to 60 fps was the right move. The graphics really pop off the screen and the story is top notch. I\\'m seeing a lot of little babies starting to leave bad reviews to tank the score. Doesn\\'t matter though. The game is a masterpiece.This game a masterpiece of gaming.The Most Wanted game on Ps4 in this Year!Sony give her fans a brilliant chance to people who didnt this perfect game on ps3This game is a 10. I don\\'t believe that a game can be perfect, but giving The Last of Us anything less would be a disservice to the incredible effort that Naughty Dog put into this masterpiece. From the ridiculously good facial animations to the amazing character interactions, Naughty Dog\\'s incredible attention to detail is staggering. The Last of Us is one of the best survival horror games of all time; it fails to rely solely on gore and shock like many other survival horror games. The Last of Us puts a lot of stock in its characters and story. Almost every scene is rich with character development and further pushes forward the incredible story.\\n\\nThere are annoyances - such as when Ellie or other friendlies get in your way during an intense fight, the fact that your allies are invisible to the enemies, and the entire ending, in general - but, again, nothing can be perfect.\\n\\nAmazing game.To be clear...this is one of the best games EVER made. Perfectly acted, with superb pacing, incredible story, characters and world, and tight gameplay. Almost perfect. A \"9\" would be too low.I own a PS3 but have never played The Last of Us. Now on PS4 i played it and let me say to you, the game delivers a sensational experience. Its a must have for PS4. Great combat system, great story and a wonderful experience going through 60fps/1080p.I have noticed alot of reviews of the game are 0 now this is just xbox people reviewing it since there jealous i mean alot of the reviews are on the 30th of july the game didnt get released until august  so ignore the red ratings the multi player is fantastic and not broken story fantastic graphics film quality and dlc amazingWhat can I say about this game? Simply put, it\\'s a masterpiece and a must play for anybody who calls them self a gamer. Quite possibly the best game ever made. IncredibleMy review does not take into account the multiplayer and photo mode: 1)the multiplayer is amazing, but single player is where this game is at its best and where the focus should be 2)the multiplayer, when I played it on July 29th, was extremely glitchy and the hit detection was wonky...the opponent often times looked like The Flash running in front of you at super speeds 3)I hate photo mode as when I\\'m moving around I accidentally bring it up as it\\'s tied to L3...oh well, this game didn\\'t need it.\\n\\nWith that said, I played the opening sequence of the game (up to the point prior to seeing what you are smuggling out of the quarantine zone) and I fell in love with this game all over again. I played this game on the PS3 last year and am glad the feel was kept in the remastering of this game. The higher resolution and with it running at 60fps, you can really tell a difference in the smoothness of the gameplay and the textures really pop...even compared to the very well done PS3 version.\\n\\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who has a PS4. It doesn\\'t matter if you played this on the PS3 or not....get....this....game. It is the best movie I have ever played.One of the best game I have ever played. Absolutely the best game I ever played on my Playstation 3 and the best game I own on PS4. Get out there, buy it, play it and recommend it. It really is that good. Anyone scoring this game any other colour than green should get their heads examined, because their heads are full of trolls...This is the best Ps4 game till now BY FAR (including destiny´s beta). And one of the best videogames ever made. There´s always things to improve in videogames that´s why I give it a 9.5, but they made a HUGE advancement for the hole industry, Naughty Dog raised the bar in so many ways!! thank you naughty dog, thank you sony keep up the good work, keep up making this works of art and I will keep on buying them.Bought a PS4 for this. Emotional, dramatic and most of all, makes you want to really sympathize with the characters. Not disappointed in getting a PS4 for this. 10/10sony payed to score givers and reviewers.....don\\'t waste your time and moneyOne of the best games I have ever played in my 17 years of playing video games. It isn\\'t perfect, but it is as close to perfection as you could reasonable hope for. What is so special about this game is that while it does the storytelling part of it (story, characters, pacing, ambiance, music) so incredibly well, it doesn\\'t do it to the detriment of its game play. What I actually played perfectly complimented the story they were trying to tell, but when you took those same mechanics, and put them into a competitive multiplayer in the form of Factions, you got one of the most unique (as unique as a TPS multiplayer can be) multiplayers of the last generation. Kudos to Naughty Dog, you guys have achieved something special here. It\\'s too bad some people (looking at the low-effort negatives) can\\'t grant you that much.\\n\\nAs for the remastered part of this: it is the same video game, but it looks tons better, and it sweetens it by including in game commentary, a photo mode, and all DLC. All of that for a lower than normal MSRP. Definitely worth the price to newcomers, but also people who enjoyed it in the past, so that you can see the world Naughty Dog has painted for you that much more clearer.The Way its meant to be play ...\\nThe last of us Remastered packs a lengthy and memorable single player plus a wonderful and unforgettable DLC and a fantastic multilayer mode along with all the DLCs published until today.\\nThe HD remastered is not mind-blowing if you have already played on PS3 but you will be able to notice how sharp and clear all the game is in comparison to PS3 version, Textures are in a higher quality form and draw distances are much more clear, with that being said, even though technical quality of TLOU is no comparable to a next gen game but surprisingly the game is that much well crafted that is really holding up to this very day very well and it is still awesome to gaze upon the beauty of this game.\\nthe biggest advantage in the Remastered edition is that the game runs on 60fps, it makes the combat really fluent and much more believable than it was on PS3, overall experience is just awesome in 60fps but in case you still like that cinematic looking and feel of 30fps ND has put the option to lock the FPS to 30 under display options, as well make sure you update the game because the shadow maps will improve when you game is switched to 30fps but with that being said still the 60fps is more preferable.\\nI can not say much about the gameplay, one word just fantastic, every part of the game is crafted very well as if each parts are made to test are ability of surviving, the story, character developments are wonderfully written throughout the game and after a while you will start to feel a bound between yourself and the characters in the game ....\\nFinally the multiplayer is awesome as well, i wont spoil it for you if you havent been able to play it on  ps3 but i can say this game worth of 49$ even if you wanna go only for multiplayer experience ( like me ).\\nFinally the last of us is packed with a 20~25 hours of single player content and countless hours of multiplayer content only for 49 dollar, its one the best (and perhaps) the best game of the last gen consoles ....\\nI recommend this if you havent played TLOU, and if you are a fan of game otherwise there isnt much reason to pick up this game ....I picked up The Last of Us Remastered about 2 weeks prior to it\\'s release, and have already played through it once, and have already delved into Grounded mode for the second run though, which is insanely hard. Naughty Dog has outdone it again. The game is a gem, it\\'s a shame that any moron can create an account and write a negative review of the game. Clearly all the negative comments and rating are by people who have never played the game. And for the public, the game just released, how do you give it a 1 or a 0 when you clearly haven\\'t played through the game and all it\\'s additional content? Unlike most people I had two weeks to sit down and enjoy the game, and I just broke the ice. I haven\\'t even touched multiplayer. With all of the additional content that Naughty Dog has included in this game, it\\'s more than worth $50. People should actually play the game before docking the score because they are ignorant and clearly have something against great storytelling and gameplay. On that note, whoever has not picked up a copy, it\\'s worth your while, and it\\'s only $50.Since I am a huge fan of The Last of Us, it was a treat experiencing, in my opinion, the best and most touching storyline of any game I\\'ve ever played again, and now with even better graphics. this game was, and still is a crystal clear 10/10.Overall the game is good and fun, Thriller , Horror , Adventure, Shooter using cunning and wits this game keeps you interested to the end and after a good multiplayer game online with people you know makes this even greater ^^DGOTY, GOTY, GOTY.  I know it was already GOTY last year!  But it is that good of a game.  Best thing that I\\'ve played on PS4 so far.  Which I already played this on PS3, but it died a few months back, and since there are no games for PS4 out there, this was worth a return to play again, and besides I never played the DLC......  Anyway, I\\'m rambling.  This game is told very well, very intense, very emotional, it sucks you right in.  Sorry Xbox fans ( I have an Xbox360), but you\\'ll need to get a PS4 or PS3 to play this, play this, play this.The Last of Us is a full package! Every aspect you want from video game is in its highest quality here : narrative, characters, exploration, leveling, shooting, etc. This game is a masterpiece, must own for everyone who appreciates art1080p.60 frames per second. One of the best looking games on PS4,or any console for that matter.If you\\'ve never played this game before, PLAY IT. This game won\\'t wow you at first, but the story takes you in and the gameplay gets awesome when you use what you have(molotov,explosives,shotguns,etc). Crafting a healthpack while a clicker is looking for you adds alot of tension in the game. Every enemy in the game feels like a threat and you can\\'t run and gun very easily. You have to take them down one by one and every bullet counts. You craft a shiv (knife) to take down a clicker and you have to find the materials for that. Joel and Ellie are very well written characters. They are very raw and real characters. They aren\\'t written to get you to like them, they are written for how the writers feel they truly should be, given the circumstances.\\nThe DLC Left Behind is very good. DO NOT PLAY IT BEFORE YOU BEAT THE GAME.\\nIf you wan\\'t a dark,raw, gore filled game with an amazing story that won\\'t shy away with messing with your emotions, then this game is for you.Instead of a thousand words, I will say that this is the best game of PS3 and PS4One of the best games ever and the most critically awarded one with prettier graphics, DLC and better frame rate? YES please.\\n\\nAnyone who likes great storytelling games should not pass this one up.Masterpiece!!! Best game EVER made!!! This is true next generation! This game include everything: best music, best graphic, best story, best characters and best gameplay! My note: 11/10.It is one of the best games of last generation brought to life on a new console. It includes all of the main dlc for multiplayer and singleplayer, a whole new set of trophies, better graphics and 60 fps, which makes this game a gem to have on ps4. dont pass it up.The game is worth the highest score possible, it should not be downrated based on the \"Console Exclusive Meh\" kind of talk. It was one of the most interesting games i ever played, i like the mix of story with gameplay.I played this game on PS3 and now bought it again for the PS4, the original was already a masterpiece, this version comes with all multiplayer and single player DLC. As in the PS3 version, the story is emotional, ranging from funny to depressing mood, fighting is very flexible and invites for experimenting with different approaches. While the visual upgrade is not that huge, since it was already looking fantastic, the higher frame rate changes the experience for the better, especially during fighting. The reason I think it is worth getting this game again is because it has high replayability beyond the story itself (e.g. multiplayer) and if you have a PS4, you want this title in your game library. If you never played it before, it\\'s a must-have anyways.A mature and thought provoking experience.  I wished I had the ability to make different choices as Joel, but the fact is his choices are consistent with his character, however much I wanted at times to make him someone else. Truly the most cinematic and novelistic game of the last 10 years. As close to art a videogames get.Shortly: much better version of best game in history! It\\'s same game as on PS3, but that game deserve few more playthroughs! 1080p on 60FPS and opportunity to reach all trophies again is well worth to buy this again.The Last of Us Remastered takes advantage of the superior PS4 hardware and delivers a true \"AAA\" experience. The story was brought to life by the fantastic atmosphere and realistic character models. I can\\'t wait to play more amazing games from Naughty Dog.The best experience of my life with videogames, this time with better graphics than the first version (For PS3), The Last of Us Remastered comes with the DLC - Left Behind, and is a perfect game, more perfect than your predecessor.Well this is the Remastered; which basically means prettier, version of \\'The Last of Us\\'. Which is absolutely 1 of the best games ever created; if not the single best ever. I absolutely loved everything about \\'The Last of Us\\' when I played through it on the PS3; and there\\'s no exceptions on the PS4. Everything in this game works and fits perfectly together. From the fun; addictive, & unforgettably brutal  gameplay & mechanics to the absolutely Incredible tear jerking, thought provoking, and unforgiving story told through your journey as Joel & Ellie. But even with some of the absolute best story telling & gameplay under its belt you could say that the most impressive part of The Last of Us is the unforgettable acting & voice work. The one & only Troy Baker who plays & voices Joel brings to life one of the all time best & mentally broken characters in any video game, movie or any other form of entertainment. And with that said his partner, Ellie through mostly the entire game is just as equally brilliant & satisfying; and was played & voiced by Ashley Johnson. And that\\'s just those 2 characters. There are SO many absolutely brilliantly written; acted & voiced characters that you not only come into contact with but play their own huge roll in the game, and I of course have to mention that the great & veteran Nolan North too voices & acts out 1 of the games most important characters. \\'The Last of Us\\' will simply have you hooked with your jaw dropping to the ground throughout the entirety of the experience. If you miss out on The last of Us then you are missing out on 1 of the absolute best \"Experiences\" in any form of entertainment. Once you\\'ve played through \\'The Last of Us\\' you\\'ll never look at gaming the same way again!\\nBravo Naughty Dog; BRAVO!!!I loved this game on the PS3 and I am loving it on the PS4. This game has one of the best stories of all time. I really feel like this is a movie more than a game (story is that great) but plays amazing (not like those failed games that focus on only the story and neglect the mechanics/gameplay).\\n\\nPro:\\n-Improved graphics\\n-60 FPS or loked 30 FPS with improved shadows\\n-Uses the DS4 controller (best controller ever)\\n-Includes all of the DLC (not the extra stuff for multiplayer like cosmetics)\\n-Photomode (this mode will consume a good portion of your time. So much fun)\\n-I never played multiplayer mode on the PS3 but wow, the MP on this game is so much fun and amazing.\\n\\nCons:\\n-I personally haven\\'t experienced any but one bug in which Joel disappeared for a few seconds while playing but that was just it. I\\'ve heard of people experiencing some other minor bugs but I\\'m sure that all of these will be patched soon.The last of us is a true masterpiece, the best game ive ever played so far.\\nThe story, gameplay, graphics, music, sounds, voice acting  all 10/10.\\n\\nThe MP is unique and fun, this game is worth your money.\\n\\nIm glad i bought this game.The best game of the past generation and an excellent game for this generation.60fps is fantastic and the multiplayer remains flawless.I hope the 2 will come soon.Never have i been so invested in a game and its characters before, its perfect! .The graphics, the story, the voice acting, the music and the actual gameplay all really work to immerse you into the story and by the end i was so involved i felt as if i was my character. it just shows how games can really create a full audience experience in a way that films, tv etc cant quite do. the remastered version has really made the already great graphics just stunning and the added photo mode is brilliant, not forgetting Left Behind the DLC that really could have created a full blown game on its own and the solid MP that makes you work as a team to survive. The game has rightly earned all its praise and is definitely one of the best games i\\'ve ever played.Honestly this is the best game I\\'ve ever played. The story may not be completely original but the way it\\'s told and the way it\\'s presented is what makes this game a 10/10. The gameplay is fun, the combat and stealth is challenging, and it\\'s actually realistic. Most \"zombie\" games have you slashing through hordes of zombies but what Naughty Dog did with the Last of Us was genius. This game is truly a masterpiece. For a real, unbias review of this game look at Angry Joe\\'s on Youtube.If it wasn\\'t for bad story i might have actually enjoyed it, but knowing where they end up, makes everything so meaningless.Games like this break rating systems due to so many other great (but not legendary) games getting 9\\'s and 10\\'s. This game is a TRUE MASTERPIECE. Gritty and well-paced story that makes The Walking Dead pale in comparison. It has seamless transitions from cinematic to action. Naughty Dog owns as a developer. They put out such high quality, polished, gorgeous, and emotionally gripping games that you will never forget them. YOU WILL NEVER FORGET THIS GAME. I promise.It\\'s the same masterpiece I enjoyed on PS3 except better looking. The added DLC is also a big bonus, but not necessary. This game is a perfect 10 anyway you slice it, from story to gameplay, etc. Anyone who rated this game lower than a 10 is just trying to be different or get attention that they aren\\'t getting in their personal life.This is probably in my top five games of all time. The original was great looking but this one is improved with the frame rate increase, draw distance, textures and character models. If you\\'ve played it already on PS3 it may not be worth it, but if you haven\\'t, or haven\\'t played the Single Player DLC I\\'d strongly recommend it. As a return customer, I purchased it to experience the story again in the hardest difficulty, but also purchased it for the multiplayer. It is a ton of fun, and not  a ton of my friends had it or still play it on PS3. Getting a crew together and working together in the multi is an amazing time. To fans of the original wanting to go through it again and wanting a renewed online community this is great. Photo mode is also a super cool add on that I will be utilizing for sureTLU is a masterpiece. This is the first time I\\'ve played this game. The graphics are beautiful and look very realistic. The gameplay is fun and really keeps you on your toes. The collectibles do a very good job of immersing you into the story. The story itself is outstanding and the relationship between Ellie and Joel is beautiful. It is worth every penny.This game is perfect! The story is fantastic, the characters are amazing, the gameplay is fun, it is very emotional and is well worth the $50 price tag!I don\\'t feel the need to rehash everything that has already been said about this game. It was easily in the top 3, probably the best game, for the last gen consoles and it is easily one of the best experiences I\\'ve ever had in gaming. But what about the remastered version. Is it worth buying again for those who\\'ve already done everything there is to do on the PS3 version? I\\'d say yes with a few caveats.\\nThe biggest thing you\\'ll notice first is the graphics. There is a very clear upgrade in the visuals, even if it doesn\\'t exactly stand up to a game like inFamous. It comes close but you can tell this was a game that was designed for the last gen consoles. I\\'ve heard that it looks like a game that\\'s on Ultra high settings on the PC and I think that\\'s a very good description of it. Plus they\\'ve tweaked the controls a bit to help with some of the clunkyness of the original game. I really like the big button in the middle of the controller that opens your inventory screen and it\\'s easier to use than the select button on the old game.\\nThere are a few things that I don\\'t like about this version though and it starts with the price. 50 bucks for this game is way too high. 40 seems reasonable but 50 is really high for a game that\\'s been out for awhile and has been down to 20 bucks in the last week on the old consoles. Plus there have been a number of glitches that occurred in my game. Lots of stiff movements, running through walls, cutscenes not properly loading. It\\'s only happened in the first hour of my playthrough so far but there\\'s been enough of it to cause me an issue. Fortunately nothing has happened during a fight yet so things are not as bad.\\nThe fact of the matter is though that this game is still easily one of the best gaming experiences ever to be released and you\\'re doing yourself an injustice not playing it at least once. For people like myself who have already beaten the main game and DLC on the PS3, there is still alot of playability here mostly for the fact that there\\'s nothing else to really get for the system for awhile. If you\\'re looking for something you know will be excellent and to relive one of the best games in recent memory, then you have to pick this game up. Even with the fairly steep price tag, it\\'s still worth it.One of the greatest stories ever told through interactive media.  With each conversational aside and cutscene I felt myself falling in love with these two protagonists and many of the side characters they encountered. Their plight and they themselves felt real and because that I rooted for them.\\n\\nThe visual beauty of this game can not be understated. I often caught myself mesmerized during cutscenes or in gameplay by the masterful environment design, character models and lighting. The power of the PS4 brings to life the texture of this gritty world. Every shattered tile, every fractured street, every scruff of beard and every blade of grass is a thing of beauty in and of itself, especially on closer inspection.\\n\\nThe mechanics of TLOU are not revolutionary but they are very strong. I found it innovative and appropriate that when crafting or healing you\\'re left totally exposed. It adds an extra level of realism and danger.  TLOU has a few bugs (texture popping, the AI gets stuck occasionally, etc) but nothing that detracts from what is honestly one of the greatest games I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nI\\'ve only played a little of the multiplayer. It\\'s about par for the course though it has some fairly long load times.\\n\\nThe Last of Us is another bar setting game for Naughty Dog studios and for the video game industry at large. I can honestly say, that having just finished the single player,  I can\\'t wait to go back and play it again.Better than the original Game! All the Content (SP & MP) included. Improved GFX + higher Res, together with 60+ FPS.... a Masterpiece became even better.\\n\\nPS: Dont listen to the People who feel allowed to say the Multiplayer ist buggy, because waiting times. The Multiplayer is NOT buggy, but 90% of the People still play the Story, and the other 10% are basicly completely playing \"Elimination\" Mode only. In Elimination it takes a few secs to find a Match.Enjoyed play this game even already played on ps3,graphics amazing and the dlc Left Behind is very good addiction,would like more dlc\\'s like,but if you don\\'t like playing a campaign more than one time,you should pass this gameSame as the ps3 version but with the Left Behind DLC and imporved frame rate and textures, it remains a masterpiece of  a game, story is fantastic, graphics are brilliant, really sucks you in and makes you feel like your actually Joel. I give it a 9.8/10 - the only thing that bothers me is the AI is sometimes very dumb and it also annoys me when Ellie runs in front of them and they never seem to notice her.This one is definitely a masterpiece.\\n\\nIf you have played the PS3 version and switch to PS4 version, you will notice a big different to gameplay and graphics. How so? PS4 version has improved and better graphics such as better water reflects, building design, model design, facial design and so on. Gameplay has been improved as well having 1080p and 60fps which means you will have smoother gameplay on shootout and so on.\\n\\nThe story is nice as well, especially the relationship between the main characters and how balanced is the encounter between Infected and Bandits.\\n\\nIf you like survival horror games with balanced encounter of infected and bandits, buy this game.\\n\\nI rate it 10/10.',\n",
       " 'The best game released on PS3, if you did not play, then go throughI don\\'t know what I can really say about this game without giving anything away, but I will tell you that it is easily in the top ten games that I\\'ve played, and I\\'ve played a lot of good games, also the characters of Joel and Ellie are absolutely brilliant, I think Ellie has such an amazing premise, and Joel seems to have been affected by the infection in quite a realistic way. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that as good as it is, I don\\'t think it\\'s for everybody, some people might be put off by the atmosphere and violence within the game, while some will love it for the same reason.\\n\\nIf you\\'re thinking of buying this game, then I recommend buying it.I wouldn\\'t call this game perfect, but it\\'s pretty close for me. I wanted to rate this a 9.8. Since I cannot, I will give it a 10 because it is closer to a 10 than a 9. There IS the occasional glitch (as with most games), but the only thing that really takes me out of the experience is when Ellie will run out in front of the enemies and they will not see her at all! These moments remind you that you\\'re playing a game and take you out of the experience.\\n\\nOther than that, the story is absolutely top notch, the acting is top notch. One of the most engaging experiences I\\'ve ever played. (and I\\'ve been gaming since around the age of 3 back in \\'83!) The combat is underpowered in comparison to other games, but I LOVE that. It really gives a sense of fear and dread as you move along in the game. It really emphasizes the need for stealth. I would recommend this game to almost anyone, except for those who just absolutely loathe stealth games. Even then, you should give it a shot at least for the story and acting. The first 10 minutes will make at least a tear come to your eye. If it doesn\\'t, then you probably aren\\'t human.I don\\'t think I have ever played a game like this. Saying this game was great would be an understatement. The game has an amazing story and is also helped by its incredible gameplay and characters. You take the role of Joel in a post-apocalyptic world, your job is to take Ellie (who I believe is the character of this generation) to a rebel group \"the Fireflies\". During your journey you will find characters that you can love and also hate. Not only Joel and Ellie\\'s love grow, your love for these characters will also grow.  If you can play one game in your life PLAY THIS!!!You should realize right from the beginning, you are in for a dark, remorseless journey into survival. Your sympathy is for the two main characters, and some of survivors they meet along the way, but the dread of what is around the corner haunts you for them and like the stunning graphics that never cease to amaze, this game continues to enthrall you down to the last scene. The game play is flawless, and you know this because it never interferes with story and the combat....and Ellie will simply blow you away with her tough independence and fierce instincts....The PS3 deserves this game as a brilliant way to say good-bye to this generation of consoles...worth every cent and worth every play time minute.This game truly is phenomenal. Naughty Dog proves yet again why they are the kings of the PS3, and arguably gaming in general. The Last of Us gets everything right. The environments, the atmosphere, the gameplay, the storyline, the characters, the graphics. Everything. I really can\\'t say enough how amazing this game truly ended up being.This game is on my short list for perfect 10\\'s.    Few games come to mind that are close to this caliber of top notch presentation, amazing story, and superb game play.  This is a true return to survival horror, a genre many fans felt disappeared after Resident Evil 4 (some say even before that). I honestly haven\\'t even started to play multiplayer yet, but I only hear good to great things about it.  I know it\\'s a little late in the current gen to say this, but this is a system seller of a game if I have ever played one!Very good game.  I love all of Naughty Dog\\'s games, they are fun and have very good graphics.  Go buy this game now and support ND for making better games on the PS 4!Such an immersing world, great characters especially Joel en Ellie. Brilliant and such a fleshed out story i won\\'t forget in a long time. Intense and incredible well put together gameplay mechanics. THE best game i have ever played.First off, let me say that this game has one of the greatest moments in gaming: The intro. If you\\'ve played the game, you know exactly what I\\'m talking about.\\n\\nSecondly, I did give the game an 8, but I totally understand why everyone is giving the game a 10. It all depends on your expectations. Are your expectations weighted more towards the playing the game? Or weighted more towards going through an experience?\\n\\nFor me, I was expecting a little bit of both, and I was very happy overall. The story, art, sound design and tension during gameplay is probably the best you\\'ll ever experience. However, I don\\'t believe the game is a perfect 10 for a few reasons:\\n\\n1. Immersion. Naughty Dog has built an AMAZING world that pulls us in right away. We get invested into it from the get-go. With an intro like that, EVERYONE gets completely glued to the game. I bet most critics went  10/10!\" as soon as they finished the intro. It\\'s that good. However, the downside to this is that when the game contains actions that don\\'t make sense, it breaks the immersion. Most examples of this appear in combat sequences:\\n\\n1a. Your companions are ignored by enemy AI. This is forgiveable, because in such a crazy messed up world, the game would be way to hard to manage everyone.\\n\\n1b. Joel does NOT pick up ammo in a world where ammo is \"scarce\". This is a big one. When you see every human enemy blasting bullets in every direction while you only have 10 bullets, it\\'s as if Naughty Dog is holding up a giant sign saying \"HEY! We did this intentionally to artificially increase tension!\". It does raise tension quite a lot, but it also doesn\\'t seem to fit the mindset of a survivor.\\n\\n1c. Shivs. Why does Joel craft shivs that break when being used to stab people? The guy should just own a knife! (or a machete that doesn\\'t break in 3 hits). It makes no sense, and in the world of The Last of Us... it\\'d be smart to own a knife. Those of you who have played the game know Joel has no excuse.\\n\\n1d. Enemies are ridiculously evil. Every enemy in this game (aside from one), was a one-note badguy. They would shoot you on sight, try to kill you for \"survival\", but then they turn around and go \"You killed my friends!\" For some reason it felt like we were supposed to feel bad that we were killing them, but on the other hand... screw them. They shot at me first! The first demo Naughty Dog showed at E3 felt like they initially wanted players to feel the moral weight of what they did to players, but... It doesn\\'t work at all with the regular enemy AI.\\n\\n2. Puzzles were repetitive and simple. Let\\'s face it, there are only 2 types of puzzles in this game. Drag a dumpter/palette/shelf to act as a stepping stone... or drag a wooden plank/ladder over a gap. Uncharted had much more interesting puzzles. I understand Joel is in the modern world, but I still think a little more could have been put into the puzzles we saw in this game. However, you could also consider every combat encounter a puzzle, as strategy played a very important part.\\n\\n3. A lot of forced walking around and looking at things. After that amazing intro, I didn\\'t even notice I was spending so much time in scripted walking sequences. However, upon my second playthrough, I saw that the first hour of the game is basically walking sequences with a bit of stealth thrown in. Try a second playthrough, see if you felt the same way or not.\\n\\nNow, with all that said... how about the positives? These are the AMAZING things done by The Last of Us:\\n\\n1. Story. You will love the story. Nearly everyone will love the story.\\n2. Graphics. Some of the best on the PS3. In the game you encounter some animals, and they look amazing.\\n3. Sound Design. Clickers are extra creepy because of the sound they make. And gunshots can scare the crap out of you if you get spotted while sneaking around. It\\'s great!\\n4. Tension during gameplay. During sequences with the infected (especially clickers), tension may be through the roof. The sneaking elements mixed with the way clickers work makes for a good time. Throwing bottles and bricks to trick your enemies feels 10 times more satisfying than throwing rocks in FarCry 3.\\n5. Grenades and Molotovs! They\\'re so satisfying to use.\\n6. Strategy during gameplay. In the game, Joel is able to use his \"hearing\" ability (see: wallhack), to gauge enemy positions. This makes every combat sequence feel like a puzzle ready to be cracked wide open. And once you complete it... it feels gooood.\\n\\nOverall, The Last of Us is a very good game. However, I have the feeling most critics wrote their reviews when they were still high off the thrill of the ending. After taking a second playthrough, it\\'s much easier to see the game objectively, and to get a better picture of how The Last of Us is as a game. The thing I find the strongest is the tension during gameplay. It adds a lot to the atmosphere. However, the atmosphere can be broken by a few design choices.\\n\\nThank you Naughty Dog for another amazing game!The amazing game I believe from now on we\\'ll see more games with the same soul as The Last of Us, I didn\\'t give 10 because the secondary characters during the game do not change the behavior of enemies.The Last of Us is one of the best games I have ever played.  Imagine Uncharted 2/3, that looks better, sounds better, has more engaging characters and a more emotional plot.\\nImagine that with combat which encourages not just multiple playthroughs to try a different strategy, but reloading checkpoints to get your first strategy just right.  But that doesn\\'t really do it justice.\\nIf you are looking for a brand new and unique experience, this isn\\'t perfect, but you should play it anyway.  If you are looking for one of the best experiences to be found in gaming, you should definitely play The Last of Us.Extraordinary game! Great story that makes you care about the characters of the game. The game play is effortless and continuously keeps you interested in what’s around the next corner.  Love figuring out what’s the best line of defense for getting though enemy riddled areas.  A must purchase!I really like this action-survival-horror -next generation game, forget all this MS haters...if I compare the graphics of this great game with  GTA IV, Darksiders, Mass Effect 3, Skyrim, Hitman, the action, gameplay, are matchless. It\\'s not a perfect game, not at all,  not for all, but I like it and  it\\'s my kind of game.This is hands down the best game I\\'ve ever played. Awesome gameplay. And the story is by far the best in any game.\\nIt is also the first game ever that has made me cry.\\nNaughty Dog gets everything right with this game. The voice acting, environment, characters, atmosphere and music is amazing.This is a great game and if you own a Playstation 3 you should play it.\\n\\nThe bad \"User\" reviews by GonzoGamer and Wilfogn  Your other review are all XboX360 games. .\\nSo my question to you is is? Are you really that stupid, why would you go and give a bad review to a game of a console you don\\'t even have.....  You should pursuit a career in politics, you are picture perfect for the job.My real score would be a 9.5 but im just rounding it up.  The graphics and story are 10/10 but the gameplay would be like an 8 for me. Also the friendly ai can get in your way sometimes but nothing too bad.The Last of Us, its a game that needs no introduction but had to show more than what we were expecting in order to not only keep up with the current generation & next generation games coming out but also live up to the par that Uncharted 2, and Uncharted 3 set for Naughty Dog.  The game takes you on a journey that takes you throughout a world 20 years after a pandemic had arose.  While keeping new ideas fresh the best thing that \"The Last of Us\"  has going for it is excellent character development backed up with a truly memorable story.  So if you are able to get your hands on a copy \"The Last of Us\" is a game that you do not want to miss out, and that is why it deserves a 9.8/10.A gripping story about human survival and the re-ignition of love in a bittered heart. The voice acting is perfect, facial animations are top notch and the protagonist becomes a very \\'real\\' person as the story progresses. The graphics are pretty much the best current consoles can offer. The art direction can best be described as \\'dreary\\', perfect for a post-apocalyptic setting. I also love the sound design and the minimalistic sound track producing melancholic instrumental music that really gets you in the right mood. The story is thrust forward using ingame dialog sections, cutscenes and various items you find (such as pamphlets and notes). Overall, the fiction feels very \\'real\\'. Thrillingly able to suspend my disbelief with a mature story.\\n\\nGameplay:\\n\\nThe game can be best described as a third person action adventure with lots of stealth elements, and a bit more exploration than you would expect from the creators of Uncharted. The game has a wonderful pace (absolutely not run and gun) and great stealth sections that will have you at the edge of your seat. The stealth reminds me a bit of Manhunt, in which rooms are like puzzles and it is for the gamer to find out efficient ways to get through the rooms. As in Manhunt, taking down enemies feels hefty and combat is raw and visceral. There is also a crafting system in place, in which you use recourses scattered throughout the levels to craft items like health packs and shivs. However, resources are scarce and some items use the same components. So you need to choose: do I want a health pack, or a molotov?\\n\\nThe only downside to the game I found is the fact that sometimes your companions behave unrealistically during stealth sections, wanting to follow you around and obviously showing themselves while doing so. But it doesn\\'t detract from the experience and luckily no alarms are triggered when it happens. Overall the companion AI is good; it is hard to make companions behave perfectly in stealth gameplay (how many games even try it?).\\n\\nLastly, I recommend turning off all tips in the options menu so the game doesn\\'t tell you what to do all the time, yet I found the normal difficulty setting challenging enough. Take your time with this one, try to find the hidden resources and be absorbed in the fiction. Uncharted 3 really was more of the same and a bit boring, this is refreshing and gripping. Like Red Dead Redemption and Mass Effect 2, this was a game that just did not bore me. 10/10 for the single player.This is the first survival game in a long while that truly feels like a survival game. You have such limited ammo with your relatively underpowered weapons, that you must strategically plan out each encounter in order to survive. Most games suggest that you explore the environments, but The Last of Us actually forces you to. Without the necessary scavenged crafting supplies used to make health kits, upgraded weapons or booby traps, you simply won’t live through upcoming encounters.Best game this generation  along with Uncharted 2 and Red Dead Redemption  Everything in this game is  top notch  Graphics  Gameplay  Storytelling ,Voice acting and soundtrack  This game is one of the reasons why I have a PS3 .\\nand when you see a dickhead like GladkyAndrey who rate  this game a 3 then change his mind and rate it  0  you know that this game is a  beeeeeeaastWow, just wow. Naughty Dog has always been my favourite game developers, why? Because they always succeed with their games. And this game was no exception. Naughty Dog have worked really, really hard with the environment ,story and dialogues, not to mention how the characters move and react. I could see that in the beginning of the game, when the girl moved with quiet steps in the big house looking for her dad.  Maybe not the best description but if you play the game, you will notice) I am absolutely speechless about this game. Every move and everywhere you go, you sort of jump in to the game. I haven\\'t got this feeling since I played the Half-life franchise, which is a pretty old game.\\nI understand why this game got over 50 perfect scores. This and three other Naughty Dog games is on my number 10 list, with this one going number 1 and Jak II: Renegade going number 2 I can only say that  Naughty Dog, you just made another masterpiece!Truly a masterpiece!! This game gives me great hope where games can go from here,having played most games you fear \"been there done that\" not with The Last Of Us. Naughty dog have shown what great developers they are with Uncharted series,but with this game they have stepped into legendary category and Sony\\'s flagship developers. Amazing game with great graphics (probably best looking game on ps3) and a great story arc. The story is the games real strength and how it emotionally draws you in,then throw in suspenseful set pieces with a gritty world and action violence and you\\'ve got a gem,and that\\'s what Naughty Dog has given us,probably the ps3 last exclusive gem. Simply put YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME.Best games ever made.\\nA 10/10 score is not enough for this game. Naughty dog has made many great games, but this one is the best and probably the best game of this gen.This game is absolutely amazing. All around amazing!! I just recommend to at least give it a try before you make your own decision. From start to finish this game is incredible, amazing story which is expected since this game comes from the same studio that developed uncharted (naughtydog). Visuals are fantastic, fighting and stealth kills are very unique and fun. I will not be surprised if this game wins a tone of goty awards. This is definitely my game of the year. Like I said before it is definitely worth playing for yourself.For me this is another masterpiece game from Naughty Dog Studio. This time we are living in apocalyptic times which means...if you like walking dead or other zombie/survival movies you will love this game. Graphics are outstanding and characters, as always, absolutely brilliant. The best thing is the \"reality\" of atmosphere. Usually in apocalyptic games or movies there is an arsenal of guns and stuff  here you have to think how to survive a battle. That\\'s something new in games.\\nIf you considering to buy a new ps4 console, you have to play that game. It\\'s definitely one of the best games on this generation.The hype leading up to my chance to play The Last of Us had me worried, as it seemed like I would be disappointed because I thought no game could live up to the expectations I had for it. I was wrong. Naughty Dog has succeeded in crafting what is undoubtedly one of the absolute best games of all time, an emotional tour de force that, while set in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-in-all-but-name-only-infested world, spends a lot of time exploring the humanity of enduring such an environment.\\n\\nSome reviews have criticized the actual gameplay, but I love it. The game rewards players who can think creatively and act stealthily over those who can shoot the enemies dead the fastest. By other metrics, the game makes no compromises: for a game running on almost 7-year-old hardware, the graphics are stunning, with the writing, voice acting, art direction, soundtrack, and level design all among the absolute best in the video game world.\\n\\nThe game has kept me greatly on edge and had me in tears less than an hour into the game. It has kept me in awe of both the ugliness of many of the areas ravaged by the events of the game and the sheer beauty of those that nature has reclaimed in the absence of meddling from humanity, infected or not.\\n\\nGames like this and Bioshock Infinite make me optimistic about the future of gaming. The Last of Us is a true masterpiece, ranking among not only among my absolute favorite video games of all time, but among my favorite entries in any art/entertainment medium. It\\'s often gritty and heavy, but it greatly rewards those who enjoy deep, sometimes tragic, character-driven storytelling: the same strategy that networks like HBO and AMC seem to be focusing on with their original content in recent years to much success.\\n\\nAll in all, if the idea of a post-apocalyptic survival game doesn\\'t completely turn you off, you owe it to yourself to play this game.This game delivers everything you want and need in a game to make it a masterpiece a emotionally investing story and characters, stunning visuals, and tense and immersive gameplay! This is a must buy for anybody!!This game is truly fantastic. It deserves every bit of praise that it gets  but unlike other reviews I\\'m going to try and simply break down why. Firstly it\\'s an action game, so it\\'s a 1010 action game, not the greatest game of all time, out of every genre. So what\\'s important in an action game? Action right? The gunning feels more realistic than any other TPS I\\'ve experienced so far, and every weapon is so unique to handle it actually feels like you\\'re carrying a real assortment. What about AI? Humans will come up behind you in a matter of seconds to shoot you from behind, if they can\\'t get behind you, they will throw a molotov  at you with pensive precision. What about stealth? Clickers must be dealt with by crouching and not walking  but creeping, if they hear a loud footstep they will come charging, and on contact you will die instantly. Not only is the challenge there but it feels so nerve-racking no matter where you go. Humans can also be dealt with stealthily, choking them to do, wasting no resources, or if you choose, move past everything, like something out of MGS.  Combat  it\\'s there as well, numerous objects can be used as melee weapons, a bat will take a few hits down someone with a combo, whereas a blade might take just one to kill. You can even reinforce weapons with blades to cause one hit kills on Clickers. hear you asking about the rest... Graphics? It\\'s Naughty Dog, so check. Music? Does the perfect job of building atmosphere instead of sounding like a Hollywood movie  check. Story  there is nothing I can say here that won\\'t spoil things but as soon as it gets moving there is no pointless banter, just one breathtaking moment after the next. Longevity? Yes, there are comics, artefacts and firefly dog-tags to find, numerous difficulty levels and the ability to upgrade Joel in a slightly-action RPG fashion to your liking.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m trying to say is that as an action game, it has it all and then some. It improves on almost all facets of an action game. Whereas others are becoming more casualized and more scripted and shorter and shorter, ND takes us in the opposite direction, with a challenging, punishing, absolutely enthralling experience that does not let up until it is over. With an original multiplayer element to boot.\\nI hope I have given a little more insight into why this game is so praised. Also kudos to Sony for letting ND do what they want  it has paid in spades and so it should.Let\\'s see... Do you like story-driven games with immersive voice acting/cut-scenes and great gameplay? If yes, then this game is for you. The Last of Us is one of the best games this gen and I recommend to every (real) gamer out there. Have fun!This game has an excelent history, the relation of Joel and Ellie are fascinating. The graphics are amazing too, considering the limits of PS3. It´s not an open world game, but its wonderful.Riveting graphic, intense storyline and relentless awesomeness. Kudos to Naughty Dog for making such a great game of all times. Looking forward to see more games like this.the only people giving this a rating lower 8 are fake ps3 owners aka xbox fanboys... this is one of the best games ever made to date... its a masterpiece. This game is what a true survival game should be... you should be sneaking around and you should be thinking about is it worth it firing this gun.Actually i dident wanna give this game a 10/10, why? well because this game is BRILLIANT! but no perfect! this game sets the bar for other games in the future, but it sets the bar high for itsealf as well.. normally in other games you would look past that the AI sometimes acts a bit wird, like not seeing your AI friend, though i must say it does not do that often!! but the game itself is such a high standart that you can\\'t ignore it like in other games! this games is THE best narrative story game ever!! you get attach to this game like no other and you really feel their pain and love from the characters, the graph is stunning and the gameplay is fantastic! i would love to give this game perhaps 9.8, meaning it is so freaking good, but not perfect! but when you see Reviews from former Xbox loosers who rates it 0 or 4.. thats so dumb.. its so freaking dumb, and thats why i have to give it a full 10!! its like a film guy who loves titanic gets to review Resident evil.. dont.. this game is the best PS3 game, and possibly the best console game ever made! dont miss out!It made me cry  game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Characters ,graphics,history everything is great about this game everythingThere is nothing bad I can say about this game. It was fun to play, it hit you where it counts, and it made you genuinely care for the characters. A perfect 10 out of 10 in my opinion.This game is simply amazing. Naughty Dog is one of the best video game developers in the world, and they continuously keep producing masterpieces like this. This is a must buy for every PS3 owner.Awesome story\\nFun gameplay\\nTense feeling\\nAnd very detailed graphics. Not so good looking, but very detailed!!\\nAnd Ellie is so lovely!\\nAm must play for every gamer!I don\\'t know what I can say about this game, without revealing anything, but I will tell you that easily among the first ten games I played, and played a lot of good games, also the characters of Joel and Ellie are absolutely brilliantI think Ellie has such an amazing premise, and Joel seems to have been affected by the infection in a very realistic way.The only b ad thing I can say about this game that, as good as I don\\'t think for everyone, some people can be postponed by the atmosphere and violence within the game, while some will love it for the same reason.If you are thinking of buying this game, then I recommend buying it.… Expandthis is not a game.. this story is a real life.. i love this studio and thanks SONY for everything.. after the best game of history (uncharted 3) this.. and i don\\'t now how of this two is better.. thank you ND... thank you sony.. hater please don\\'t ruin the game with 1.. please it is a shame..The Last Of Us is officially the best game I have ever played. The story is outstanding and brilliant the moment the game starts it hooks you in with the magnificent story. Naughty dog has done an absolute outstanding job with this game and it shows through out the game. The graphics is brilliant and stunning in beauty. The Game play is brilliant the best game play i have ever seen in a game and the controls is extremely smooth and easy to learn. If you have played all 3 uncharted games and thought they were good wait until you play the last of us you will not be disappointed.The last of us is the game to beat for game the year. If you loved uncharted I recommend strongly you play the last of us it will leave you hooked  and glued to your TV screen for hours upon hours. I f you have an Xbox 360 trade it in get a PS3 and play this game no Xbox game will ever be as good as the last of us. If naughty dog created such and amazing game that even the critics have given it top scores I cannot wait to see what naughty dog has in store for us in the future.Anyone  rating this under 90. 2 word can characterize him. Lobotomy and sterilization. This game has all the elements of survival. If you are act first and think later kind of gamer then this game might not be for you. Patience and strategy and careful planning  filled with mature content make this game GREATAlthough this games story isn\\'t no more than 20 hours long. It is perhaps one of the best games of 2013. It just has alot of emotion in the story and makes the entire single player experience one of a lifetime. The main characters Joel and Ellie are developed really well. They feel very human and alive which makes the story pop out even more. I haven\\'t tried multiplayer yet, but after finishing the story I already feel I got my moneys worth.\\n\\nIf people don\\'t like this game then joke is on them, because without a doubt in my personal opinion this is the best game in 2013.Developer Naughty Dog has added \"The Last of Us\" to its pristine resume, which has become one of the more prestigious in all of video games. The PlayStation 3 game, which arrives in stores Friday, tells the heartfelt story of Joel and Ellie trying to survive in a world filled with death and woe. It\\'s 20 years in the future, and the human race has been overrun by a parasitic infection that turns people into zombie-like husks that hunt other humans. There is no cure, and the goal for the few remaining humans is to survive.\\n\\nJoel is an experienced smuggler, an occupation that is strictly forbidden by his quarantine zone\\'s military rule. He is employed by the Fireflies, an organization that fights against the military, to smuggle Ellie across the country. Joel isn\\'t interested in what the Fireflies want with Ellie until details come to light that make this job the most important he\\'s ever taken. The story of \"The Last of Us\" follows these central characters for a year, as their bond grows during their cross-country journey. This opens opportunities to not only explore the depth of these characters, but also show off post-apocalyptic versions of American locales. The trek begins in Boston and lands in Colorado and Salt Lake City, as well as a lengthy stay in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nRecognizable Steel City landmarks include the U.S. Steel Tower and the BNY Mellon Center Downtown, along with nods to the Strip District and Fort Pitt Bridge, but the breathtaking art is just background for the human elements on display.\\n\\nJoel and Ellie\\'s storylines change throughout the game\\'s 13- to 15-hour tenure. In a world overrun with horrific zombie-like creatures, the focus is almost always on the humans. The characters  not the infected  drive the plot. Much like \"The Walking Dead\" game and television show, the writers of \"The Last of Us\" realized that humans are much more intriguing than the mindless zombies around them. The gameplay keeps up with the presentation and narrative. Whether Joel is up against the infected or humans, stealth is key because ammunition is scarce. Quietly taking down foes is a key to success. When that fails, guns are needed, and Joel comes to acquire plenty of them. Being low on ammunition provides an added challenge to the game\\'s combat, but that makes progressing all the more satisfying.\\n\\nNaughty Dog has created a console-defining masterpiece in \"The Last of Us.\" It achieves the perfect balance between thrilling action and emotional storytelling. It arrived as one of the most hyped games of the year, and it delivers conclusively.This is my first review on meta-critic and for a damn good reason! The Last Of Us is unbelievable, amazing, and epic and solidifies why I play games! This is one of the top games I have played in my entire life and got me very emotionally involved.. For once I am happy to say I receiveded more than what I payed for.. 10/10How can anyone give this game a \"60\"?  TLoU is one of the best games i\\'ve ever played.Look, without spoiling anything, I will just say this: The Last of Us is one of the best games of all time, no exaggeration. If you\\'re a (real) gamer you will enjoy this. I don\\'t recommend for those that don\\'t pay attention to stories though, because Story is the best thing about this game. Buy this masterpiece!Story/premise:  The Last of Us plot is unpredictable and truly terrifying, but it\\'s about the two main characters, Joel and Ellie as they form a father/daughter relationship as they traverse through a post-apocalyptic United States claimed by nature. The story is dark and brutal, more so than any other game that I\\'ve ever played before. The infected in this game\\nis something unprecedented in the post-apocalytpic genre, as the humans are mutated and infected by a fungus known as Cordyceps.\\n\\nVisuals: The visuals of the Last of Us is beautiful and stunning. The textures are so rich in detail. Everything from the foliage, to the characters, to the world\\'s objects are rife with details that one would think it\\'s impossible for an 8 year old hardware to pump such impressive visuals. It might not be a huge leap from how Uncharted: Drake\\'s Fortune to Uncharted 2: Among Thieves was, but it is certainy a leap, nonetheless. But that is to be expected from a developer that pushed the boundaries of graphics ahead of any game on consoles. It safe to say that The Last of Us in some way surpasses Uncharted 3: Drake\\'s Deception,  many would agree this is the best looking game on consoles, and I agree.\\nConsidering how Naughty Dog used every juice left in the PS3\\'s aging hardware, it definitely is the best looking game on consoles.\\n\\nGameplay: The gameplay is as I expected. Although to some it may not be fun due to the fact that the combat is supposed to be in a way realistic. Joel is a veteran, brutal and ruthless survivor, but that does not make him a super-solider where he could aim a gun with 100% accuracy, that\\'s not to be expected from a game like The Last of Us.\\nJoel wobbles and has a sense of weight as he aims with his guns that he acquires throughout his journey, and that adds a sense of desperation and tension to the combat, it\\'s really fun and challenging at the same time. But, of course, you could always improve the aiming and lessen the wobbly-ness by upgrading your skills by acquiring supplements throughout the game\\'s\\nworld. The crafting system is one of the best I\\'ve ever seen in a game, it\\'s also all in real-time, so that adds another sense of tension as you have to be careful when to craft items. Fortunately, you\\'re able to upgrade your skills to quickly craft an item. That being said, you\\'re not able to upgrade all of Joel\\'s skills at one-playthrough, so this encourages\\nplayers to play again through the New Game Plus option that retains your skills and upgrades from the previous saved game.\\nThe close melee combat in the game is also brutal as you\\'re able to pick up planks, pipes and hatchets and even upgrade them with spikes and barbed wires. It\\'s effective to a certain extent, as the weapons you carried can break after a certain amount of hits than you\\'ve dealt to an enemy. The durability and strength of each weapon varies.\\nThe gameplay also gives you the option to whether go in guns-blazing, but that\\'s kind of a bad idea as ammos are scarce or if a player prefers to play stealthly. I can say that the stealth aspect of the game is fun. Joel can go into a Listen Mode that gives a highlight to enemies near by that makes sound, that adds another way for you to plan your next move and strategize.\\nYou also have the ability to crouch this time around and the cover system is much more dynamic than what we\\'re used to in the Uncharted games. Keep in mind that the Clickers are able to kill you in one bite, so you have to be careful, but you\\'re still able to kill them with a shiv. Both the infecteds and the human conflicts and encounters are both equally challenging as the dynamic AI is unlike anything I\\'ve seen before.\\nEllie does occasionally help by throwing a bottle or brick at an enemy when Joel is in danger, she\\'d also come running to you to help you as she stabs an enemy to free you. The same goes to other secondary characters that\\'ll join in the adventure for a awhile. Replayability in this game is what you\\'d expect from games like the Uncharted series, with a lot of collectibles to find. The game took me literally 25 hours to complete as I was scouring every nook and cranny in the game for supplies. This is definitely the longest game, Naughty Dog has ever made. Add multiplayer, and you\\'ve got yourself a game worth purchasing.\\nSound design: The sound design is astonishing and highly detailed in basically everything, but most of all is the terrifying sound of the Runners and Clickers that\\'ll surely keep some players\\' heart pumping as they hear the clicking sound of a Clicker. Soundtrack is emotional and stunning.\\n\\nThis game is a masterpiece and I can see why, with all the praise and perfect scores it garnered, this is one of the greatest game of this generation and probably of all time and one that\\'ll surely be discussed for years to come. I give this game a perfect score. The ending certainly got me thinking for days, it was something unpredictable.i am amazed at Sony for putting out a must own masterpiece at the end of every console cycle. The PS2 had God of War 2 and now PS3 has The Last of Us. I felt i was in a post apocalyptic world and that doom was right around the corner at every moment. The thrills and scares in this game are perfect, the graphics are mind blowing, and the acting and story just rival block buster movies to perfection. Please get this game ASAP and shame on the pathetic nintendo and xbot fanboys spreading hate on the reviews to lower the score... it is so stupid when everyone knows the last of us eclipses any crap from the other consolesIn short, this is \"THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE\"\\nA perfect masterpiece in every aspect.\\n\\nGreat gameplay.... fun, intense, realistic, and challenging !\\nBrilliant story, filled with a lot of emotions that will keep you so attached to this game and its characters !\\nOutstanding graphics, amazing and\\ufeff realistic animations, and breathtaking cut-scenes !\\n\\nA remarkable experience that you would never forgetAfter the first 3 hours or so, this game really opens up. It\\'s boring til that point, but then becomes something you can\\'t put down. The graphics are beautiful and the story is incredibly well-written. You feel a bond with them and genuinely want to see them succeed.I was very impressed right away, with the cinematics, textures, lighting, etc.\\nThe mechanics of how Joel moves around has a bit of a Dead Space feel to it, which I found easy to pick up.\\nMy only complaint being that you cannot command your AI companions to be passive or aggressive.\\nI often found myself yelling profanity at the television, when you\\'re trying to sneak around Clickers and Tess is firing off rounds.\\nOther than that, I feel that the storyline and characters are well developed, the game has a high replay value, and the environment is superbly designed.Boy was I wrong in my initial review. This is by far the most stunning game I have ever played. Yes the game at times gets very repetitive (look for things  sneak around  repeat) and graphics (not design) are a bit outdated but can\\'t really score it low because the level design, characters and game are just the best. I love how the characters emotions grow and change throughout the game.\\n\\nI really hope naughty dog work a bit harder on the game play next time and change it up so it isn\\'t just about looking for materials for crafting and sneaking around. Otherwise the game is perfect. Best PS3 game by far. I thought Uncharted 2 would be my fond memory of my ps3 but The Last of Us gives us an amazing farewell to the current generation of consoles.Really average game, painfully average for the score it\\'s getting. I feel the only reason why it\\'s getting such scores is the publisher, but that\\'s alright.\\nThe gunplay is average, typical TPS fair. Really, if you\\'re looking for gameplay innovation, it\\'s not here. The whole \"scarce ammo so you have to scavenge\" thing is ruined by the fact that most of the enemies are guards, which drop ammo. The\"zombies (they\\'re zombies, don\\'t lie to yourself)\" are generally clumped in areas and not dangerous, outside of clickers. For puzzles we have crate stacking, ladders, moving massive objects to stand on (Joel is superhuman) and motors. You\\'ll be seeing these a lot because they\\'re repeated more than HL2\\'s physics puzzles. The game has stealth, which is does just as well as any other TPS game with stealth, but the AI is stupid, making it easier. It\\'s really linear, shamefully linear. I think this is what kills me most about the game, the atmosphere is really good, ND nailed it with that, but they went NOWHERE with it. It\\'s another linear story game that takes no risks. Walk, get into scripted scene, fight guards or zombies, cutscene. For 12 hours, that\\'s the game. It occasionally changes things up, but that\\'s essentially the game. I won\\'t spoil the story, but it feels like the left it up for DLC and expansions, which is shameful. If you like really average story based games, go ahead. If you want more, maybe just rent it. It does little wrong, but even less right.The Last of Us is that rare game that shows us what kind of potential the aging PS3 still has within itself. The Last of Us is a survival-horror game by Naughty Dog (creators of the Uncharted Series) that shows us just how bad life in a  post apocalyptic world can be. With breathtaking graphics its hard not to call The Last of US one of the most visually stunning games of recent history. The visual elements aren\\'t even the tip of the iceberg for this gem. Sporting a compelling story and memorable main characters The Last of Us certainly brings alot to the table. There are some A.I. issues at times usually at times of tension where you have to be stealthy to avoid enemies but, your A.I. companions just carry out like like they own the place.The Last of Us is also one of the few (if not only) survival horror to include a multiplayer mode. While I haven\\'t spent a lot of time playing multiplayer it feels like a generic team deathmatch with vague objectives.  Overall, The Last of Us is one of the best survival horror games released on the PS3 and I wouldn\\'t mind revisiting in another iteration on the PS4.If you played The Walking Dead, you can skip this. If not, go play it instead of this.\\nThe Walking Dead has actual, meaningful choices unlike this game. You pretty much do what the game tells you to, and that works for something like Uncharted but not this game. The Walking Dead set the bar for the Zombie theme and this game is not even coming close to it.\\nThe gameplay itself is even worse. Horrible gun play, terrible and unreliable stealth mechanics, bad immersions because your companions can stand face to face with every enemy because they only can see your character. As a huge Uncharted and The Walking Dead fan, I can NOT undertastand how this game got this high score.If you are coming into this game expecting to be blown away by a complete game, you\\'re going to be disappointed.  Nothing revolutionary, gameplay wise, but nothing misplaced, either.  Just tried and true elements that feel comfortable, though you can debate whether that\\'s a good thing in a game that\\'s relying on you being drawn in.   If this was a TV Show, it\\'d definitely be worthy of a higher score.  The story is definitely quite good.  The problem is that its about as interactive as a painting.  They went with the \\'Open Barn\" design philosophy of multiple paths all leading to the same set pieces.  This can be a fine choice, but when characters react as though you\\'d been in a running gun battle in the set piece,  when you literally did not make a sound, it really breaks the immersion.  This type of game is award fodder, because it\\'s easy to call good because it has a good story, and does a bunch of stuff we\\'re familiar with, but at the end of the day, it feels like they played it too safe, and it could\\'ve been even better if they\\'d been willing to reach.Just completed the game in one sitting, took me 12 hours.\\n\\nThe game is good. It\\'s not great nor does it live up to the hype created around it. The graphics are very mediocre. Maybe it\\'s just me because I\\'m used to FullHD resolution with AntiAliasing and Anisotropic Filtering on PC, but the game looked quite bad in some places. Low res textures, vegetation on most places is not an actual object, just some leaves painted on the texture. The game runs only in 720p which made it look even worse on my 24\" fullHD monitor, aliasing was everywhere. Additionally you can see the frame rate dropping to around 15-20 FPS, especially during some places in the cities. This makes it extremely hard to navigate and aim.\\n\\nLike I said, I completed the game after 12 hours and... it hanged after the credits screen. I could go to start menu but couldn\\'t load, save or quit the game, so I had to shut down the game through PS menu. Started it up again to see what bonuses I unlocked by completing the game and... my save was gone. So yeah, I\\'m quite pissed off right now, 12 hours for nothing. Nice quality assurance testing there.\\n\\nNow, onto the game itself. The story is nowhere near as driving and immersing as the one in \"The Walking Dead\", which I consider the best adventure game I ever played. There are a few good moments, but most of the time the game play is limited to running around buildings collecting items and shooting bandits. The cut scenes are awesome, the voices and animations are really good, but there\\'s not that many of them. I wish the story was narrated better and didn\\'t just skip through parts. The story is 100% linear, as far as I know, there are no choices in game you can make to affect the story, so there is no re-playability value what-so-ever. In the end I never got attached to any of the characters like I did in \"The Walking Dead\".\\n\\nI liked the character of Ellie, although because I couldn\\'t make any choices on how to interact with her and Joel is an a-hole most of the time, I never made that \"bond\" which would make me miss her even outside the game. Throughout the game you can sometimes stop and talk to Ellie, but it is so rare event that it doesn\\'t really add anything to the experience, especially that you have no control over what they talk about and it\\'s usually just small talk about surroundings or recent events. The ending is disappointing, but I guess you\\'ll just have to figure this one on your own.\\n\\nDevelopers advertised the game with the AI that is clever and it will try to outsmart you. Ha, what a joke. The AI completely ignores your companions, they can run in front of a bandit and the guy couldn\\'t care less. Enemies actually try to take alternative routes to get you and flank you, but most of the time they just barge into the room and stand there thinking \"now what?\". Your companions are pretty much invisible when sneaking, so you don\\'t really have to care about them unless they are grabbed by an enemy. This made me really detach from my character and I didn\\'t really care for my companions much.\\n\\nThere are also some design problems I do not really understand like weapon mechanics. Shivs are used to kill the clickers, but you lose them every time you use them, like ammo. Since when are knives one use only? Same with some of the melee weapons, steel pipes go bad after 7 hits. Some weapons are badly unbalanced, like the shotgun. In later stages of the game, where soldiers have bulletproof vests and helmets it can take up to 4 shotgun body shots to kill one soldier from about 4-5 meters away. To make it more ridiculous max ammo for the shotgun is like 16 rounds.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s not a bad game, but it isn\\'t nowhere the GOTY and I think the 10/10 reviewers didn\\'t play through the whole game. About half way into the game I was already tired of collecting the same items over and over again and playing hide and seek with the bandits on stages clearly designed for combat (scattered objects to use as cover which are placed so obviously, upon seeing them you know there will be enemies around). I was hoping for another experience like in \"The Walking Dead\" but unfortunately I am very disappointed.\\n\\nPositive:\\n+ Good script and game setting\\n+ Awesome, but rare cut scenes\\n+ Environments\\n+ Animations and voice acting\\n+ Ellie character\\n\\nNegative:\\n- Graphics\\n- Linear and very predictable story\\n- Lack of interactivity with the characters\\n- Dumb AI\\n- Some game mechanicsI usually just sit and read reviews, but I felt compelled to give a short, accurate review. I am six hours into the game, and I must say, I\\'ve been getting quite bored of it. Ohhhh no, I\\'m in the dark and there are clickers walking around; now what.......um, it took me 10 minutes to navigate around them slowly. Wow, fun. Granted the visuals can be nice at times, but the gameplay, story, etc is nothing new. We\\'ve seen this before. I think the game is quite overrated if you ask me. I love Naughty Dog and they\\'ve done a good job again, but not a 10. I think the critics  media followed suit because for it to score this high is a bit disturbing. Nonetheless, it is a good game. If you have $60, love Naughty Dog, and are looking for a good game to keep you going until the PS4, then go for it. This will take some time to platinum. If you\\'re going to buy this based on the perfect 10\\'s it\\'s getting, I\\'m sorry to say, I think you will be disappointed. In the end, to each their own.....happy gaming guys.This game is not bad, but it\\'s not a 10 by a long shot. The combat and movement are sluggish and frustrating at times. The story is predictable and while it looks pretty, there are definitely better looking games out for PS3 at the moment. The crafting and upgrade systems are shallow and disappointing, as is the looting, but then, one should be mindful that this is a shooter, not an RPG. Some areas have multiple, clever ways of dispatching enemies, but all too often the player is simply fighting off wave after wave of enemies, and it get boring quickly. There is very little ammo, which is fine for a survival/adventure game, but this game is predominantly a shooter, and then it gets very frustrating.\\n\\nVoice acting and music is great! But a game needs more than that. Rent, don\\'t buy.I don\\'t want to spoil any of the story so I\\'ll get right to the point; The Last of Us takes all the WORST parts of the Uncharted series (the stealth and sneaking) and stretches it out across 12 hours of gameplay.  This is THE MOST overrated game I have ever played.  I cannot believe people are trying to say this game is \"the best game ever\" and better than Uncharted 3, which was an utter masterpiece, or better than this years BioShock Infinite, which was another amazing game.  I went to the midnight launch and beat the game in one sitting so I didn\\'t have to deal with the horrible save-game bug right now that prevents you from saving your progress, so I\\'m not even factoring that horrible oversight into my review.  Honestly though, save yourself $60 and put that money towards a next-gen console.  The multiplayer is also incredibly generic and unbalanced.  Whoever wins the first round wins the entire match because they can instantly afford a set of armor at the start of the next round which allows you to take twice as much damage before dying.  I\\'m utterly shocked by the metascore the critics have given this game.  What can you expect though, SCEA published games almost always have a full point or two higher metacritic scores than they deserve, who the hell knows why.I created an account for the sole purpose of attempting to save a few people some money; this game, while decent as an entire package, comes across to me as a venture into gaming redundancy. I will not be discussing the particulars of the story or game mechanics, both to avoid spoilers and to prevent this from turning into a term paper. While TLOU does manage to incorporate an average level of quality in each aspect, the game overall comes across as a dud, mainly because as I played this game I couldn\\'t get rid of the overbearing sensation that I had already played this game\\'s prequels and that each of these, either in their own way or as a whole, were much much better than this latest release:\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played stealth-focused games such as Dishonored, Metal Gear, or Deus Ex you\\'ve already experienced far more advanced and enjoyable stealth mechanics.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played adventure-based games such as Far Cry or Bioshock you\\'ve once again enjoyed better battle and combat interface mechanics.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played puzzle-based games such as Prince of Persia or any other game that incorporates more than a ladder/plank combo...enough said.\\n\\nAnd by far the worst and most over-hyped category, the carbon copy mix of Zombie-Survival, Coming-Of-Age, with a dash of familial bonding, was the greatest disappointment for me, as most games I am willing to forgive almost all assuming the story can bridge the gap between a lack of mechanics and my enjoyment. In this case, for me, the gap was only widened.\\n\\nWhile I understand that all creations, particularly in the entertainment industry, rely and build upon previous ventures, the lack of creativity or any sign of originality in this game, to me, is unforgivable and undeserving of the seemingly fanboyish reviews it has received. This game is worth playing to kill some time or as an introduction to the genre if you are just entering the gaming scene, but in no way was it worth $60; wait for the GoTY edition it is almost certain to be developed into or borrow it from one of the multiple friends you have who have almost certainly already picked this up.Okay...so a 5 is what this game gets. And YES...I played it, today actually, after spending $60 and kicking myself afterwards. This game is all hype. I bought PS3 JUST to play this game. (I\\'m an X-Boxer) So disappointed. This is not really a Survival genre game, but a Shooter mainly. It absolutely mimics Uncharted...couple of minutes looking around, picking stuff up...and then shoot shoot shoot for 30 minutes! Just some zombies thrown in, but not until like 2 hrs. in. If you want to buy this game with sweet memories of Dead Island or the Walking Dead (Telltale) in mind...please don\\'t! This is Uncharted...period. Yes, the graphics are Beautiful! And I really do like the characters/storyline. I just think that a lot of us were mislead into thinking this game was something it\\'s not. Shooter fans will love it! Quest lovers won\\'t.Game is overrated, I don\\'t know what game all you are playing but this game is not the best as so many people seem to be saying. Beat the game in 7 hours and has no replayability. All you do in this game is sneak and strangle monsters. Graphics are ok, I see people saying there the best they have seen,wtf, if you think that then wow you are blind, the games graphics are okay and the sound and story is good, the controls are good. Just not worth the hype its been getting. No replayability. Uncharted is better than this game. Go rent it before you by it. Who knows maybe you will buy into the hype and get easily manipulated like the Masses. Ift his game was not made by Naughty Dog and made by a not well known Dev then I bet you that this game would get low scores. People that give good scores to a game for not being all that great makes the gaming community worse. You give a game a good review and its not good, Devs will just make the same crap and get away with it and take your money and laugh at you. This game does not suck but the overall score sure does. 6.5 out of 10 for me. Beat it now im returning it..Now, I don\\'t really buy games as much as I used to now that I\\'m older, though I do follow the gaming industry closely and tend to buy only the \"best\" games that come out. When I do play a game though, I take it seriously, and want something that hooks me with a good balance of challenge and reward, and great gameplay.  Well with the hype this game had behind it and the scores how could I have been ripped off by another game like bioshock infinite (which blatantly dumbed down and removed gameplay)? Welp I was, and I\\'ve officially lost complete faith in gaming. This game is living proof that gaming is dead. It\\'s been more than 8 years since the release of resident evil 4, yet this game doesn\\'t even attempt to outdo gameplay standards set in the survival genre this game is (laughably) trying to claim it belongs to. In fact, it\\'s gameplay should be completely unacceptable in the year 2013, but the unwashed masses who bought into the console craze \"because of duh grafix!\" will throw their hands in the air and claim this and every other overhyped game like it is \"duh best game evarrr!!!\". I\\'m sorry but if you only play games for the graphics, blood, and story, and you don\\'t value gameplay you are not a gamer, and I am now convinced the mainstream console audience and the audience these games are aimed at are not gamers. This game is nothing different than the same old handholdy LCD shooter we\\'ve been seeing all generation long, cover based shooting, simplistic gameplay leading you from cutscene to cutscene, checkpoints every few steps, dull brown and grey graphics, ect. The only reason this game is getting so much praise is because of the hype behind it, people are like sheep and go right along with the hype, afraid to say anything that conflicts with common opinion. If the game wasn\\'t made by naughty dog and had no hype behind it, it wouldn\\'t be getting anywhere near the praise. Want proof? Look at all the good reviews, all they say is \"best game evarrrrr\", they won\\'t give reasons though, and if they do they\\'re related to graphics or some other element irrelevant to the game itself or how it plays. The game is also awfully glitchy considering it\\'s made by \"The best developer of this generation\", what a  joke, can\\'t even get the save system right, me and my friend had to play it all in 1 sitting, not like it matters because games today are so short and simple. I seriously wonder how long it will be until they phase gameplay out all together and just go back to making FMV games, or QTE driven games, because mark my word, that\\'s the direction these amateur developers who run the industry are setting gaming up to be headed in. R.I.P. gaming.This game is kinda overrated. The game play is not that amazing really the gun play is very similar to uncharted (as you would kinda expect I suppose). The story line is not all that and the first couple of hours are pretty boring, I hate games that take ages to get going. The graphics are pretty good and so is the animation too. How many zombie games do we really need though  This genre is massively over done, when are people gonna get over zombies geez...Also at the time of writing this there is a massive game breaking bug which makes you unable to save your progress and has affected TONS of people.I have finished the game earlier this week, since then I had some time to reflect about it.\\n\\nAfter getting over my „fanboism“, cause I have been awaiting this game for quite a while, to look at it from a more neutral perspective, I must say that “The Last Of Us” is OVERRATED!\\n\\nNow bear with me, I\\'m not saying by any means it’s a bad game, it’s a piece of art, a masterpiece even, very beautiful, especially visually. But hearing “the best game of this generation” or “the best game EVER made” is very false to me. Let me try and help you to understand where I\\'m coming from:\\n\\nOnce I have looked past the eye candy, I noticed the gameplay is very shallow and repetitive,  the infected lack variety with only 4 types and the humans have a very flawed AI which is very exploitable (also doesn’t help that you keep on killing the same 5 guys cause there aren’t that many enemy skins). The Puzzles, if you could even call them that, are no challenge at all, and only require you to push a ladder from point A to point B or drag a dumpster around for a little while so you can climb on it. The game is far too forgiving, even on the hard setting, keeps on holding your hand, treating you like a little  child, generating checkpoints after every minute and even giving you more ammo and med packs out of nowhere when you run out. It just seems overall like it was designed for the casual gamer, so parents and infants could easily beat it. In short, it offers almost no interesting challenges or compelling gameplay surprises.\\n\\nNow lets get to the story (which most people claim to be the strongest part of the game), its full of clichés from previous post apocalyptic zombie scenarios, and even at its best moments it never reaches the depth and feel a good movie could provide. It feels more like a budget tv-series with a very limited cast, so I really don’t understand when people claim to have cried while playing it.\\n\\nThat all being said it still was a very enjoyable experience, which I’m glad I had the pleasure to go through. The best part about it truly where the visuals, some of the best I have ever witnessed in a video game, and the 2 main characters Ellie and Joel (even a later Villain) where some truly detailed and interesting characters which made out the main charm of the game.\\n\\nVideo games where always about the gameplay to me, and I find The Last of Us has a lot of problems there. I think the whole “Let’s try to be a movie” approach of video games is really getting old.\\n\\nI still highly recommend it to anybody who likes video games, or art in general, I didn’t mean to sound too negative about it I just wanted to express why I think game sites giving it 10 out of 10s is complete ****\\n\\nBut hey, its just my opinion.What happens when you create a game where stealth is absolutely dreadful and combine it with retarded crafting system? The most OVERHYPED game of the year 2013. I\\'ve had my share of these games earlier and im just about sick of playing these \"games\" where you watch cut scenes every 5 minutes.\\n\\nFirst of all, how come you make medic pack from a rag and alcohol? That\\'s right, you shouldn\\'t be able to do it. Instead of putting lots of tiny details into the game or hiding looting items to smart places they have to throw items into our faces. Somehow i don\\'t see how its possible to find everything so easily in police controlled state. Without forgetting there is some kinda virus lurking around and people are going crazy.\\n\\nGraphics aren\\'t top class either and there just doesn\\'t seem to be enough freedom of exploring in the game. This leaves the game dumbed down and ultimately a very boring experience.\\n\\n[Remember that by thumbing all opinions down you are supporting game makers and developers to make more cash in games for casuals, like this one.]The Last of Us. Extremely favorable reviews seem to follow this game everywhere. But I cannot seem to figure out why. Graphics are OK. Nothing special, nothing new. I myself found FarCry 3\\'s graphics much better. I am a huge fan of survival horror games but this is neither. It\\'s just a stealth game with limited ammo, and the gameplay is clunky and repetitive. The story is boring and predictable and never really shines. The characters are drab and I forgot about them as soon as I finished the game. I had to force myself to finish it by the way. I am appalled at the good reviews this game has been getting. Do yourself a huge favor, Rent first! One of the WORST games I have ever played. Shame on you developers and critics alike.God damn it, The Last of Us™ is not only criminally overrated, but an actively bad game. The plot is bereft of any innovation, and is advanced only by long, LONG cutscenes which lead to MASSIVE \\'cinematic\\' walking/running from point A to point B, stopping only to shift the occasional ladder or mash buttons in unfun quicktime events. This part of the gameplay (which essentially amounts to poorly rendered cutscenes and is obvious filler) is only broken up by further cutscenes or sudden outbreaks of chest-high walls, which precipitate another tedious bout of the game\\'s stiff, unresponsive and awkward third-person shooter aspect.\\n\\nDo you see all the perfect scores this overblown, poorly designed travesty got? RIP gaming journalism. If you know anyone that considers this game more than a 5 out of 10, put them down. The infection has already taken their mind, and you\\'re doing them a mercy they don\\'t deserve.First 15 minutes are great, after that the games has its moments (especially in the beginning) but then it starts to lose its charm. gameplay  average third person shooting, solid brawling (good feel), kinda plagued with \"gimme a hand\" moments, graphic and sound are great, lot of really nice touches in the environment and animations of Joel and Ellie, good dialogues and not so great story (few WTF moments and taking the way too much risky road for the sake of actiony gameplay). Giving it a lower score to balance out other overhyped reviews. (imo it is 6-7/10)This game is not as good as some may say.  if you like a slow game that is stealth based then maybe.  dont buy this game if you want action or a fast pace.  the graphics are better than uncharted but the rest of the game is worse.  the controls suck and are sluggish.  the combat is so bad that you almost have to play the game stealthy.  not worth $60. maybe worth $30 for a used copy if you really want to play it.  dont buy this game expecting alot other than good graphics and keep you hopes low so maybe you wont be disappointed.  just my opinion but this game is WAY over rated.From my perspective, and in my opinion, this is one of the best paced games ever produced. Every level has meaning and makes sense in why you are doing what you are doing. Every character has depth and emotion. Every minute of gameplay is engrossing and enjoyable. In all  an unforgettable game.This is one of my all time favorite games, such a flawless game probally naughty dogs best game yet. Hopefully they will continue this franchise on the ps4.This game is the PS3\\'s masterpiece, and also its best farewell gift. Never before in this generation of consoles I\\'ve felt so much excitement, joy, sadness and involvement. This is more than a game, it\\'s an experience. Even when completed, you\\'ll frequently find yourself thinking about Joel and Ellie, what they went through together, the people they met, and who they become.\\n\\nThank you so much Naughty Dog. I can\\'t wait to discover what you will gift us with on the PS4A true work of art. With superb graphics, gameplay, story and characters, this amazing game blows me away at every level. This game probably didn\\'t deserve a full 10(thanks to the bugs), but between 10 and 9 i go with ten. If I had more choice, I would give the game a 9.9\\n\\nSPOILERS________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nI now want to discuss the ending. Sparking controversy, the ending showed Joel \"stealing\" Ellie away and straight up lying to her face. I personaly think that the ending was perfect. It showed the damage of Joel\\'s expirience a lot of depth. It was a fitting ending to a superb game!The Last Of Us is a benchmark in storytelling, characters, atmosphere, and gameplay. How long has it been since we got a zombie(-esque) game with a story we really care about? Naughty Dog took a genre that had been limited to \"exploding heads and that\\'s it\" and created a true masterpiece.\\n\\nI\\'m sure you\\'ve heard enough about how fantastic the story is, but not enough can be said about it. It would be a tremendous mistake to buy this game and skip all the cutscenes. The pacing and storytelling are brilliantly done and oscar-worthy. The casting for the voice actors was done carefully, and each and everyone delivers an incredible and believable performance. And I mean that. From Joel and Ellie, to random bandits, to even the infected who can still scream incoherent phrases. Each and every character is done extremely well. The story itself is dark and unexpected. For the first time in a while I felt like anything could happen. Any character could die, there was no one who was going to make it out of this game alive for certain. And that\\'s a wonderful thing.\\n\\nWhen you\\'re not marvelling at the brilliantly crafted story, you\\'re immersing yourself in a true survival experience. Playing this game on easy would be another mistake. Moderating your ammo, picking and choosing whether to engage in combat or sneak past, crafting explosives and melee weapons out of parts you find on the ground or in cupboards. It all seems so real, and so fun. There are parts when the gameplay falls a bit flat. Sequences where you need to sneak carefully to avoid clickers often results in your companion obnoxiously stomping around or speaking in a normal voice. While this doesn\\'t actually affect you in any way, it really breaks immersion and tension.\\n\\nGraphically, the game comes close to challenging some games on the next gen. It\\'s gorgeous, and has some of the best lush environments and lighting I\\'ve seen. It creates beautiful vibrant environments when it needs to, and throws you into a dark, broken, and drab world when it suits the story. It constantly reminds you what has happened to this world and never breaks the realm of reality. The character models are done extremely well too. I\\'ve never seen such accurate and realistic facial and body movements in and out of cutscenes.\\n\\nA small thing that\\'s worth mentioning as well is the soundtrack. Gustavo Santaolalla has composed a brilliant soundtrack that\\'s simple, but so emotional. They\\'re used perfectly in the right moments and are never overbearing. It subtly creates an incredible atmosphere and it\\'s the only gaming soundtrack to date that I have downloaded and listened to over and over again.\\n\\nWhen the story mode of The Last Of Us is done, the game is far from over. Naughty Dog put a lot of effort into an extremely underrated and unique multiplayer experience that doesn\\'t at all fell like an afterthought. With an array of weapons, perks, challenges, and survivors to keep alive, the multiplayer is guaranteed to keep you entertained for a good while.\\n\\nOverall, The Last Of Us is among the very few games that deserves a 10 and nothing else. Sony couldn\\'t have ended the generation of the PS3 any betterThe Last of Us is astonishingly beautiful and utterly compelling in every way. Ellie and Joel are fantastic characters, and few other games can produce such edge of the seat moments whilst maintaining the level of near silence that this does.\\nMasterpiece gameThe People reviewing this game really make me believe they are trolls.  This game is one of thegreatest games ever made, the story is compelling, the characters are really likeable, the graphics are incredible and the twists and turns on the way keep you interested as the story unfolds.  I would easily rate this game 11/10 as itis simply a complete masterclass in every aspect.  Anyone that hasn\\'t played this game yet really is missing out on a massive scale.  This game will be talked about in years to come and known as the game that saved the horror genre.  To finish up I really believe Naughty Dog are the best in the business for story telling along beside Rockstar, but for your average or daily gamer, I can\\'t reccomend this game any higher, I have been gaming for over 15 years and my experience on games is varied so I do know what I am talking about, this is a must have.It\\'s a pretty good game. Not a \"Citizen Kane\" moment by any means, but still worth playing. It\\'s not the greatest game of the generation, it\\'s not even the best exclusive on the PS3. It\\'s mechanically alright with a compelling narrative that steals the spotlight from the gameplay.I\\'d say this game is a masterpiece, and I\\'d accept the critique. But I won\\'t. This isn\\'t a game. It\\'s an experience.\\nThe Last of Us is out of this world. Number one  ever. My favorite game of all times. It\\'s just so incredible. I can\\'t put my feelings into words.Absolutely brilliant, Naughty Dog have cemented their reputation as one of the industry greats with yet another fantastic game. The Last Of Us is beautiful, lengthy, emotional and unforgettable. The characters are so well crafted and the gameplay so tense, harsh and violent. If you have a PS3 you owe it to yourself to pick this game up because it will be right on GTA V\\'s heels for GOTY  awards for sure.Easily the best game I\\'ve ever played on a ps3 alongside metal gear solid 4....remarkable game!!!\\n\\nThe story is amazing,you will get attached to the characters from beginning of the game,whoever owns a ps3 system,this game is a must BUY,you will love it!!!This is so much more then a game. It\\'s an experience. Truly impressive from start to finish, this is the best of the best in video games period. A must play for any gamer no matter what console you own. Can\\'t say enough about this game..... Just play it.This is the best game I ever played on PS3. Great atmosphere and some incredible voice acting. The scene with the giraffes is one I will always remember. If you have a PS3, this game is a must-play!Well. It\\'s great game. Must have for every Ps3 owner. Plot is just great Joel and Ellie are most holding in memory characters ever created. Naughty Dog can make awesome gamesI\\'m going to start this review by making a bold statement. The Last of Us is the best PlayStation 3 game you will ever play. The timing of this game\\'s release, a few months before the PlayStation 4 is no co-incidence. The PS3 has had a good run, but developers have finally reached the limit with the quality of gaming they can produce, but what a way to finish.\\n\\nThe Last of Us is set in the U.S.A. after the cordyceps infection has ravaged the human race, turning humans into vicious, aggressive, almost rabid-like creatures. The game follows the story of Joel, as he attempts to smuggle Ellie, who is immune to the disease, across the country to safety, with plenty of surprises on the way (I\\'m being deliberately vague to avoid spoilers). The plot almost resembles a movie script rather than a video game; you\\'ll understand if you\\'ve played the game. The ending (again without giving away any plot details) brilliantly leaves the plot open for a sequel; Sony also recently registered domain names relating to The Last of Us 2 and The Last of Us 3  read into that what you will.\\n\\nWhilst technically a linear game, The Last of Us is probably as close to an open-world game as a linear can be; exploration, strategy and resources play a key part in the game. The combat system in The Last of Us is probably as a real a combat experience as you will get on a video game. Much like real-life, resources are very limited and weapons are very powerful. You can\\'t simply hide from enemies and wait for your health to regenerate, instead the player must use health packs, which can be either acquired or created by the player using resources.\\n\\nThe player can use a variety of firearms in the game, ranging from pistols, to shotguns, to hunting rifles. As ammunition is hard to come by, as in reality, players are often better off using melee weapons, such as baseball bats and planks of wood. Both firearms and melee weapons can be upgraded using parts (a resource which can be found).\\n\\nResources are one of the most important aspects of The Last of Us, the player can use them as weapons, ammunition, to distract enemies, replenish their health, upgrade weapons or to access certain areas. Resources such as health packs can also be created by crafting raw materials collected by the player.\\n\\nThe player also has the ability to upgrade weapons using collectable tools, and the opportunity to upgrade their character by collecting bottles of pills.\\n\\nWhilst it\\'s clear that Naughty Dog focused on the single-play, they have included a multiplayer element as well. Like other Naughty Dog games, it\\'s relatively poor compared to the single-player, but The Last of Us\\' multiplayer, known as Factions, is a good attempt. The multiplayer takes place in the same environment as the game. Players choose one of two Factions, Fireflies (in yellow) and Hunters (in blue). There are no special abilities which are unique to any faction. The player leads a clan of survivors through 12 weeks, gathering supplies in order to advance the clan. Each match counts as one day, and supplies must be gathered to supply the clan; if the necessary supplies aren\\'t gathered then clan members will begin to get hungry, get ill or die. Clan members can then be healed by reaching the required numbers of supplies. The Factions game mode can also be linked to Facebook.\\n\\nTo sum it up, The Last of Us will be, in my opinion, the best PS3 exclusive you will ever play, and possibly the best game you\\'ll ever play on PS3 (the only real game that could compete with it is Grand Theft Auto V). The plot will keep you entertained for hours, and probably more.This is a truly brilliant game. Most of the brilliance comes from the story and the way in which it is told. More brilliance comes from the way you engage with the story through gameplay, and the compelling emotion which the game is able to make you feel the entire way through. You really get to feel what the characters are feeling and you can empathise with their situations.\\n\\nAn often overlooked part of a game is its audio. The Last of Us does a superb job with a fitting score. The audio is also very important gameplay wise as the infected will react to the sounds you are producing, and for the player it is very important to be able to hear when they are coming towards you from around a corner. The quality of the audio is excellent, accompanied with excellent voice actors who really mean what they are saying.\\n\\nThe graphics are also excellent for a current-generation game. The environments are beautiful and if you stop and smell the roses then you will see the amazing amount of detail which they have managed to cram into every area. It really feels like you are in a post-apocalyptic world.\\n\\nThe Last of Us is an experience which you won\\'t forget.This game is as close to perfect as any game to date. The story is compelling and a tension unmatched in any other zombie games. I am normally bored by stealth games but the threat of immediate death makes you creep like you\\'ve never crept before. Light moments also release the pressure and give your pulse a chance to go down. I sold this game as soon as I completed it as I didn\\'t want to taint the story. Loved this game, bring on a new story in a sequel.This game is a beutiful piece of art just not for gamers but for all type off people. This could even be a movie....but its bettter. Till the little conversations with Ellie till smashing a guys head with a rock this game is amazing. When I didnt had the game I thought...humn looks boring after a while...Well I was wrong I didnt finished the game but im almost and I gotta say this game is worth 60 euros. I got it borrewed but if I knew back then and had the money I woulod have it boughtA masterpiece. Naughty Dog made yet another masterpiece. This game is as close to perfection as ever: a deep and emotional storyline with an unforgettable ending (and the beginning, actually), hauntingly beautiful graphics with clever level design, memorable soundtrack by Gustavo Santaolalla, engaging stealth-based gameplay and a surprisingly robust multiplayer mode. If I was asked for any minuses, I\\'d only mention the fact that your AI buddies sometimes act weird, running around the level, sometimes even bumping into enemies who can\\'t spot them. But that\\'s only a minor fault that in no way compromises the game\\'s overall quality. My verdict is simple: if you own a PS3, buy it. If you don\\'t, seriously consider doing so, you\\'re missing out something truly marvellous.Just wow. A true mater piece. I like to compare it to the likes of The Shadow of the Colossus, as in it\\'s the perfect swansong for the PS3, as Shadow was to the PS2. Naughty Dog really hit the nail on the head with this one!A gorgeous, meaningful, intense, scrumptious (yes, even the sound of rending flesh...is scrumptious, somehow LOL) game.  Agreed, the AI is a little thick at times...but, the essence of the game, what makes it  great, so far outshines any minor issues, it\\'s hardly noticeable.  My only beef with games of this nature is that replay value is low for me.  Didn\\'t like the MP that much and I tend not to play story driven games more than once.  But, as far as a story game goes, this is one of the very best!This is the best console game I have ever played. Great from beginning to end. It really has it all. Nice to see after the disappointingly short and easy 3rd installment of Uncharted. The character development is exceptional, the game-play fantastic, and well balanced. Very, very good.A fantastic and immersing story that kept me on my toes till the very end, the ending was great and evoked emotion and honestly, just made me think what I would do in a similar situation. Thank you Naughty Dog, you made my childhood with Crash Bandicoot and now that I\\'m 18, you once again just create a masterpiece.Naughty dog has done it again.A great game to play after a long time,easy controls,best graphics,great action/adventure and horror mixture,smooth gameplay.This is a must play game.This game is far above and beyond any video game you\\'ll ever play concerning characters and story. This is without a doubt the best character-driven video game I\\'ve ever played and has such a fantastic story. Some people might not like the ending, as the choice Joel makes might go against players wishes, but in terms of a story that takes a turn we wouldn\\'t expect, this is an instant classic in any game, or movie, for that matter. I truly developed an emotional bond for Joel and Ellie as this game progressed, the gameplay is spot on in terms of making me nervous about a future encounter with enemies, forcing me to prepare ahead rather than charge in guns blazing. In areas that are heavily infected with the zombie type enemies in the game, there\\'s nothing more exhilarating than sneaking by an entire group of them and getting away with it for fear of not having enough ammo to take them on. This game will grip you from start to finish and arguably has the best story any video game has ever had.\\n\\nIt\\'s online multiplayer mode shouldn\\'t be taken for granted either, as it is a warm departure from the typical shooter game being played online nowadays. It forces you to plan accordingly, craft items, and sneak your way through the maps as stealth is your best friend online.\\n\\nThis game will instantly go down as a PS3 classic and perhaps even a classic in all of videogame history as well.… Expandok lets get something straight that most gamers don\\'t get. yes this game is WAY overhyped. This was one reason why i was reluctant to play it. the shooting is wonky, ai ranges from stupid to smart, some enemies seem unfair( those stupid bloaters), but this game is still a great game and is one of my favorites. the story is well told and emotional all the way through, the characters are expertly voiced and likeable. Ellie is really the star of this game. she is a great, smart character and also a total badass who isnt afraid to do what it takes to survive. her protector joel who is the main player character, is a rugged badass who is tasked with escorting ellie to the fireflies. the journey is worth experiencing so many twist and turns occur which help develop joel and ellie as characters. they joke, talk, and protect each other all the way through and as joel and ellie get to know one another their relationship changes from total strangers to a father daughter relationship. kudos to naughtydog for crafting such a wonderful experience. it sure is overhyped and i dont think it should get goty (watchdogs or gta v FTW!) but it needs to be experienced by anyone who has a ps3 and likes to experience a well told story with likeable characters. joel and ellie\\'s apocalyptic survivor story is worth the price of admission.The characters and how their relationships are built throughout the game is worthy of the highest praise. The plot plays second fiddle and simply provides an interesting context for the game\\'s content. The Last Of Us is a great character study and there are a number of subtle moments between Ellie and Joel that really stand out.\\n\\nMy only gripe is the deaf and blind response of the enemy AI to your companion AI when in stealth mode. Admittedly it\\'s not a game-breaker but it certainly put a damper on the immersion factor when it did occur. As I said, this is the game\\'s only real problem and everything else is exceptional. Unflinchingly violent, nerve wracking and as poignant as a video game can be.I don\\'t know what I can say about this game, without revealing anything, but I will tell you that easily among the first ten games I played, and played a lot of good games, also the characters of Joel and Ellie are absolutely brilliantI think Ellie has such an amazing premise, and Joel seems to have been affected by the infection in a very realistic way.The only b ad thing I can say about this game that, as good as I don\\'t think for everyone, some people can be postponed by the atmosphere and violence within the game, while some will love it for the same reason.If you are thinking of buying this game, then I recommend buying it.… Expand',\n",
       " 'One of the finest Pokemon games of all time as well as one of the finest video games of all time. SoulSilver and HeartGold allow the player to return to the past region of Kanto where more adventure and amazing content resides. The main portion of the game is phenomenal. The post game content is incredible as well.… ExpandWhat a great game. A great remaster of pokemon silver, blistering with nostalgia.its the definitive experience with Pokémon. The entire game has a gorgeous look and feeling attached to it. And its for sure the most competent and well made game of the series. Everything in this game screams love and effort, and if you read the interviews from the time, you will notice that this game indeed has a lot of this 2 defining things, that the series would lack so badly for the rest of the 2010´s.\\nThis game is huge, with 2 regions 16 gym battles, battle frontier, safari zone, and a lot to uncover if you have the Pokewalker accessory. HGSS its truly the right way to remake a game, with new content and the best of its predecessors.\\nIts a must have for any JRPG maniac out there, and a must play for any Pokémon fan.Soul silver is a great game. The best game in Pokemon history. Not comparable to Sod Shield.The best drive down the memory lane with just the right amount of enhancement for a remakePokemon HeartGold & SoulSilver are the definitions of the perfect Pokemon game. Having a massive national dex, two regions to explore, fixes to physical/special attacks, new typings and a story you can’t get attached too. This was all followed up by the Generation 4’s mesmerising soundtrack which can be played in the 8-bit tone of a Gameboy Colour. These games are truely masterpieces!The most packed pokemon game, with a post-game second quest, a selection of touch screen minigames, and a battle frontier. Visually, the game is a nice remake of the GBC classic. Updating the battle systems to Gen4 lets you use a few new moves than you could before, but mostly doesn\\'t change the overall flow of the main game too much.\\n\\nThe legendary pokemon have had a few more story elements placed around them, which I didn\\'t quite like. I think it was better when the legendaries were just mysterious pokemon that you had to go and find on your own, not pokemon that have a weird cult following in one form or another, and that must be encountered to progress the main storyline.\\n\\nThe single biggest drawback of this game is that the EXP curve and type distribution of the enemies is rather poorly done towards the end of the game, and training to get those final levels for the elite four is just a grinding slog. Pokemon has always has problems with grinding, particularly when trying to level up newly bred pokemon in the post-game. In SoulSilver it\\'s particularly noticeable above level 50, and you need to get well in to the 60s for the Elite 4 Round 2 matches, so you\\'re stuck with a long boring period towards the end of the storyline.\\n\\nI\\'m willing to forgive them though, because you get two whole regions to explore as it is. I\\'d still say that this is the best of the pokemon games.There has already been a ton of great things said about this game so Ill make it short and sweet.\\n\\nThis game is a remake of what many believe to be the best pokÃ©mon game of all time. The amount of features and game play found in the original was staggering for a Game boy Color game and Heart Gold and Soul Silver retain all that made it\\'s 2000 counter-part great, as well as including all of features introduced since. Really, the most complete pokÃ©mon game to date, a great value for your money, and a great throw back to the golden age of the franchise. The best PokÃ©mon game ever and a Reason to pick up a Nintendo DS.Being a longtime pokemon fan i was so happy to hear about a remake of silver version. This game has everything silver version has and more! It fixed every problem in the original such as slowly walking everywhere etc. I think this one is my favorite! Graphics have improved alot through handheld pokemon games in the past and love that tiny touch of 3D. Amazing game! 10 out of 10!A true classic this game is the 2nd best of the series with it being close to topping FRLG. The soundtrack is brilliant and catchy and the battles are challenging.A welcome remake of generation 2. Bit of a late review 3 years later, But still I consider this the best Pokemon game to date. I\\'ve put 113 hours into this game, and I have no major annoyances to report. It follows the same plot as the original, and there isn\\'t much else to say. But not picking this up would be a serious mistake for Pokemon fans.I have played Pokemon since the beginning and this is by far the best game of the franchise. The pokewalker was a very fun feature and it was great way to interact with friends threw and the post game and pokeatholon were probably some of the funnest parts of the game. The amount of legendarys was huge and it was fun to try and catch them all especially riaku and enti. The only down side i could think of is the amount of grinding u had to do on your pokemon to defeat red and get the kanto and hoenn  starters, but this doesn\\'t even matter much and i like how the integrated a game for you to play when transferring your pokemon to black and white. The game was really fun and easy… ExpandProbably the second best Pokémon game there is after Platinum. A truly well-done remake of the original which fixes several of the flaws present in the original game (such as leveling problems towards the end and better Kanto with tougher gym leaders).Ill think no, i feel and it is the best game ever for DS. Typhlosion and Lugia return assomly, if metascore it\\'s just a 87, ignore it because ive played it over 100h.This game is pure Pokémon.I love, a huge map, a good protagonist, great music, excellent Pokémon, everything is very good.The only bad thing is the wild, very weak Pokémon, you cannot level up.You simply can\\'t ask for more out of a video game remake. An amazing battle system and a load of memories will excite Pokemon fans all over the globe.a gr8 game!!!!! showcases the ability of the developers to remake classic pokemon games even 10 years after their original releases.. excellent value for your money.Opening a wide row of doors, Pokémon HeartGold Version and Pokémon SoulSilver are the culmination of generations past. In these two games, history is repeating itself, as you are transported back to Johto, and reminded of the terrible havoc unleashed ten years agoExcellent remake with new additions that make it worth buying. This game is perfect for old fans of the series. It certainly made me nostalgic, especially considering the original (Pokemon Silver) was my favorite in the franchise.by far the best ds game I have ever played. there are 4 evenly spread generations of pokemon, LOADS upon loads of content, and to top it off TWO REGIONS! this game is virtually flawless and certainly worth the money to play it if your a pokemon fan. 10/10This is how remakes are supposed to be done! Brings back walk with pokemon mechanic and the pokewalker is an awesome peripheral. Easily my favorite Pokemon of all time!This game has some of the most content of any Pokemon game. If you are bored, there are some minigames that you could pass the time with, but you won\\'t be spending a lot of the game on that. You start out in the Johto region. You get a Pokemon and the professor tells you that you should keep your first pokemon outside of the pokeballs. You spend all of the game with the first member of your party walking with you. This is a really neat feature because you can actually bond with you pokemon. There are also two regions, which is completely awesome. The music is awesome, and fans of the old game will appreciate the new songs. This is the best Pokemon game in my opinion. If you don\\'t have this game, go out and buy it right away!Im sorry that i cant give you an 11. this game is so damn good. relive my childhood, but enhanced in every aspect. so much hidden goodies. the item which you can switch the soundtracks to 8-bit is damn perfect. every else has said it. the best remake. thats how u do it pplThis (along with pokémon heartgold) is the best pokémon game to release so far. Pokémon gold and silver were amazing, though suffered with some graphical issues with the sprites. Now, there are much more detailed sprites. There is no point in me talking about old features, so I\\'ll talk about new ones.\\n\\nThe pokéwalker was a genius idea. It got kids to want to go outside so they can get some pokemon in a new refreshing way. The idea to have GBA sounds and modern sounds was also an amazing idea. Then there was using the GBA slot to be able to unlock new pokémon. It was a good business decision, and it made obtained pokémon feel more special.\\n\\nGym leader rematches was a great idea for those who beat the game, as it meant you could fight a gym leader you liked once again after not battling them for so long.\\n\\nI have no more to say, thanks for reading.… ExpandThis game is simply excellent. This remake portrays the greatness of the original 2nd gen games for the gameboy colour. there are 2 regions to explore, Johto and Kanto, those are arguably the best pokemon regions, as they feature the best and coolest pokemon. This game never gets boring even after 50 hours, as there are tons of legendary pokemon to catch after you beat the game.Graphics -10\\nMusic - 8\\nStory - 8\\nGameplay - 10\\nContent - 10\\nPersonal Fun - 10\\n\\nA Remake of the first video game i ever played. It was very well done.Both HeartGold and SoulSilver are excellent remakes of two of the greatest GBC classics of old. But still aren\\'t quite as glorious DS games as Black/White/Black 2/White 2 in my opinion, which isn\\'t to say they\\'re awful or anything.I have a confession to make: I’ve never played the original pokemon gold, silver, or crystal versions. I know, its strange, especially considering I am a huge pokemon fan. But thankfully, the DS remakes, heartgold and soulsilver, are just as good, if not better than the originals. They are essentially just the original gold, silver and crystal but with the gen 3 and gen 4 pokemon added in during the post game, and given the same graphical style as my favorite pokemon game, pokemon platinum. As for everything else, well, its pokemon, and I’m sure you all know how pokemon works, so I don’t think I need to get into that. The only issues with I have with this game are merely nitpicks, such as HM’s like cut and whirlpool being required at many points. Overall, though, pokemon soulsilver gets a 9/10. It’s without a doubt one of the best game in the series and is also a fantastic game in its own right. If you have not played it yet, FIX THAT IMMEDIATELY!!!Highly overrated. It\\'s unfortunate to me to say it but it just doesn\\'t stand the test of time: the charm, style, music and design of the original GSC games is completely absent, replaced by safe, boring music that\\'s not even a fraction of how memorable the original was, generic sprites and an ugly overworld that doesnt make good use of what the ds could do. Worse: it has good aditions actually locked away through events that are now impossible to get, entire story bits no less that could have made the game better and more unique, not just event pokemon. The level scaling is also made worse than before despite the aditions its gen had.\\nI recommend Crystal instead for the better Johto experience unless you really want the pokewalker app (nowadays hard to get) or want to transfer your cyndaquil to newer games.This game was a very fancy while successful remake out of the Pokemon franchise. The improving technologies throughout the years between the original and remake absolutely reveal itself throughout the game. Some Pokemon destinations do not even look recognizable without their names! Overall, this was probably the best remake out of the Pokemon franchise, while this is also the symbol for the improving technology before and after.He is a game, this is how remakes shouldOr white pokemon movies, this game lasts a lot, of the best Elite Four, fighting again with Gymnasio leaders, is compatible with Pokemon Battle Revolution, the Safari area is great, this game is a challenge this game this game this gameI love the indoors of each gyms they are fantastic. The pokemons which we loved in the 2000s are back. with exploding graphics. Pokemon soulsilver is much better than heartgold. Since you can catch Lugia which is stronger than Ho-Oh.Playing this game was pure nostalgia for me. I haven\\'t played a Pokemon game in a while because I\\'m tired of playing the same game over and over again, but when I heard they were releasing a remake of one of my fondest games as a child I went out and bought it. I\\'m pleased to report that it didn\\'t disappoint either. I highly recommend this game, especially to those who grew up playing it.A perfect game! This is by far one the best Pokemon games i\\'ve played. I got up to 44 hours of total playtime and for the price i paid (30 pounds i think) it was worth every penny.Where do I start with this game... It\\'s absolutely perfect. Easily the best game in the series, it offers everything that made the originals great but adds so much more. It easily has the best lower screen UI in any pokemon game and everything just fits so perfectly.\\nThere is a definite reason why I have over 1000 hours in one profile alone.\\nNot only the best pokemon game I\\'ve ever played but also the best game I\\'ve ever played, full stop.Besides the terrible level curve. It has the same bad distribution from the GS games and basically fixed nothing: every single problem is back, but with the ugly sprites from the dp games. The legendaries were shoving in at inconvenient places, ruining their original lore completely.\\nIt\\'s also highly expensive, in part due an add on app thats underused and you won\\'t need, so I only recomend this game if you are a collector that want them all. Otherwise, stick to gsc.Originallyi was going to give this a 10, but i can\\'t because there are a few things that are extremely annoying and unfair because they never tested it. Some moves are not capped as they were in Silver and this allows the opponent to spam them over and over, like evasion moves. Most of the game is good, but the parts that are untested ruin it.I personally was so disappointed in that i knew i was missing out on a whole generation of pokemon, and a whole world to explore. Because while Red and Blue were re-made for the next generation, Gold and Silver weren\\'t. Then Nintendo announced HeartGold and SoulSilver, re-makes of the classics with unbelievable graphics, and new features. The game improved on all the new concepts from Platinum, and still introduced new concepts. The storyline was good as ever. (in that it is a pokemon storyline) and everything was absolutely amazing. I knew these pokemon, but had never had a chance to use them. This is the chance to. so go and buy this game.Even over 10 years later and as a graduate student this game is still addicting. Video games aren\\'t what they used to be and it has been many years since I\\'ve been truly addicted to and/or immersed in a video game (the only other one has been Skyrim). When I picked this game up I didn\\'t get bored of it until over 100 hours in (who would think that a DS game or a Pokemon game could hold my attention that long?)  It\\'s not just a remake of a fantastic game, but a whole new experience with many new Pokemon to catch and an abundance of side content and additional features  a must buy if you have ever liked Pokemon video games.Excellent game, a huge improvement to the original Generation 2. There is little to add, since the game is a remake, but the way they handled the Game Corner is praiseworthy.This was the best Pokemon game to be released so far. It was a perfect remake of the classic Silver Version. Johto was my favorite region so I have some bias, but I believe that this game gave the most game play and features for the price. The Poke Walker that came with it also got me moving to level my pokemon on the go.This is how you do a remake, ladies and gentleman. You perfect the original game and add more content to make it a better overall game. SoulSilver is an amazing RPG. Everything in this game improves on the original. As someone who owns the original Silver, get this game if you don\\'t have the original. It is worth every penny of its absurdly high price of $50.A lot of effort went into adding nice little gimmicks here and there - it adds up nicely to compliment the experience. The graphics are decent and puts the Johto region into a better, more interesting perspective. When certain areas are entered, there is some interesting art that illustrates the environment and adds character. The music, like the music in the original game, is excellent and memorable. You can even listen to the tracks from the originals themselves! The story length is, well... you get to collect 16 Gym Badges as opposed to the traditional 8, so in that way the storyline is already unique. The only thing that\\'s not exactly satisfactory is the leveling... it\\'s pretty much like the original where everything is a under-leveled. At first, I didn\\'t like it, but then I realized it doesn\\'t really matter, since everyone is low-leveled. Since, however, Red\\'s Pokemon are such a higher level, increasing the level of everything more wouldn\\'t have hurt. Nonetheless, this game is a masterpiece - an impressive remake and possibly the best Pokemon game.… ExpandThis game has the most content of any Pokemon game. This game is extremely fun, and is in my opinion the best Pokemon game ever created of all main series games. I have played all main series games.Quality remaster of a classic game. The gold/silver games are some of the best in the entire series and remastered versions are always welcome. A must play game if you own a DS or 3DS.Pokemon SoulSilver is, in my opinion, the peak of Pokemon. All the games up to this point have lent their best features and attributes to this one. The game mechanics have been polished to perfection and the best storyline and world chosen. The original game was a marvel of its day, but early-2000s Gameboy Color games dated very quickly and lacked some of the features introduced in the subsequent two generations. This game delivers everything, a visual and gameplay treat for the ages. It is so easy to lose 100 hours+ in this game. My sole criticism is that the roster of Pokemon available in the game is a little small (even combined with HeartGold) and the player realistically needs access to Diamond and Pearl as well to get a \\'universal\\' experience. After this Pokemon lost the plot but it saved the absolutely best for this.This is the best Pokemon game ever made! This game brought Pokemon back up after its failure of the Sinnoh games. By far the longest game in the franchise and that\\'s a good thing! They gave us great feature\\'s like how Pokemon walk behind you and the Gameboy sounds item. With 2 regions, 16 gyms\\', 2 elite four and champion challenge\\'s and old and new legendary Pokemon and normal Pokemon. Even after you beat this game you can complete the National dex and go to Mt. Silver to beat Red. The reason a battle with Red is fantastic is that its like battling your old self. The best game hands down on the Nintendo DS. Have fun and keep on training!Pokémon Blue was the first ever video game I played. I was 6 at the time and from that moment on I kept playing all the Pokemon games in the main series and I can say Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver, are the best Pokemon games ever made. I feel the problem with the more recent Pokemon games is the amount of unnecessary legendary Pokemon thrown into the games but since Pokemon HGSS is a remake of Gold and Silver with the Pokemon from gen 3 and 4 also available, Game Freak managed to make every single legendary Pokemon count! Every legendary in the game has a purpose to the story! Speaking of story, the event Pokemon such as Celebi and Arceus act as sort of DLC, allowing the player the ability to access otherwise inaccessible places and events in the game! All this added to exploring 2 regions, collecting 16 badges and doing all sorts of daily and weekly events, Pokémon HGSS are, by far, the ultimate Pokemon experience!20/10.

People can nitpick these games and tear them apart over their few miniscule flaws, but at the end of the day, it\\'s just that- nitpicking. The positives far outweigh the negatives here, from the gorgeous 2.5D graphics, to the sheer amount of content packed into the cartridges. There\\'s no argument to be had. Everything that came before and after HeartGold and SoulSilver pales in comparison.Pokemon doesn\\'t change much aside from the sheer number of them. That being said I always liked the Gold/Silver versions the best. And then they made it again, only better. While all the Pokemon not in the first version don\\'t appear till much later it\\'s nice traveling through the lands I enjoyed when I was nine. The phone system has been improved though I miss the VS seeker from Fire Red. The rematch of gym leaders and elite four with new stronger Pokemon was a big plus.Though the game has some annoying flaws namely the how only certain Pokemon appear in the safari zone after 30 days, and it is really annoying. I\\'m not even sure how one could come up with such a bad idea. I know kids don\\'t want to wait forever for one Pokemon to hopefully appear, the ones who you have to wait for have about a 5% chance of showing up in grass. That aside as far as Pokemon games goes this is the best one.Probably the best game anyone could ever buy for the Nintendo DS, from it\\'s graphic to game-play. It\\'s basically two games in one, doubling the experience into two-half\\'s of addicting fun! Not even Black & White an match up to Soulsilver, the classic remake of a classic Gameboy game.thisgame is pretty great all around.....but what happens if your in the same situation as me who has some pf the best pokemon...and unlocked the supreme cup in th pokeathlon and reached the last room there as well.....and if you have  hot streak and have a few frontier symbols then what do you do......i mean the game is great and has a long lasting appeal but like all pokemon games once your done your doneThis was probably my favorite of the DS Pokemon games, only tied by Black 2. It has such a beautiful setting and world to it, and all the favorite Pokemon mechanics the series is beloved for. Not to mention the fun of having your top Pokemon follow you around and interact with you. This remake also clarifies a few theories and plot threads left in the original games pretty satisfactorily,\\nArt: 9\\nMusic: 10\\nWriting: 8\\nGameplay: 9I\\'m a retrogamer (and an old person ) and i played this game for the first time in 2022 (Without trying the gb version back in the days)....so i don\\'t feel nostalgia.\\nIt\\'s a classic game, simple (it was created for young players) fun to play on Nds and Ndsi that has fun minigames that takes advantage of Ds stylus.\\nLots of contents, good strategy, tons of pokemon.\\nIt has a certain enphasis on other player interaction because exchanging pokemon with other players to complete pokedex and level up monsters is reccomended for speed up story progression (but it isn\\'t mandatory)\\nMultyplayer interactions in modern time is very limited and require some preparation for obvious reason (servers are down for example)  .\\nit isn\\'t aged well...it suffer of a certain amount of grinding, backtracking, long travel distances and time  day event that slow overall progression (and enjoyment) of the game....and is a bit repetitive.\\nBut considering it\\'s age, is fun to try for \"historical\" purpose.One of the best Pokemon games to date, plenty of content for a Pokemon game and its fun to play from start to finish.Best Pokémon game created along with Heartgold have taken everything positive from all the games released, launching a masterpiece as a gift for Pokémon fans.\\nPros\\nOption to change the game\\'s OST to Game Boy when you get 16 insignia.\\nExtended item bag having several categories such as TM/HM, Apricorns, Key items.\\nMove tutor, move Reminder (being able to learn some blows that could not be learned depending on the level of the captured Pokémon), move delete (delete some blow like HM).\\nInclusion of Pokéathlon, where you can purchase items such as evolutionary stones and others through points acquired in the tournaments.\\nGreater participation of Kimono Grils in the game.\\nInclusion of the Safari Zone.\\nSimple Pokemon of Hoenn and Sinnoh through Hoenn and Sinnoh Sound after acquiring National Dex.\\nJohto\\'s legendary pokemons have their own music as legendary dogs that have the same theme, but with some changes.\\nRematch against gymnasium leaders.\\nRematch against coaches being more exciting.\\nEvents like Celebi, Pichu and Arceus are very interesting.\\nTake an initial from Kanto and Hoenn after defeating Red.\\nSpecial participation by Maylene and Crasher Wake in the game.\\nPokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum Pokémon Systems.\\nPokémon following you.\\nTelephone number with infinite limit.\\nSuicune\\'s journey became more exciting, traveling to Kanto.\\nLegendary Pokémon of other generations can be captured.\\nDeeper rival.\\nRematch against elite Four similar to rematch against gym leaders.\\nYou need to find the legendary Pokémon of each version to proceed with the history of the game, before it was optional.\\nINCLUSION OF VIRIDINA FOORT.\\nCelurean, Fuchsia, Cinnabar and 24 and 25 routes won songs according to the first generation of games.\\nNo negative point.to this day the best and most feature complete games in the entire franchise.The best region/map of any Pokémon with the WORST selection of Pokémon. The way to really enjoy this game is to trade over a team of level 5 guys from the start. I always have to wait until I have 6 or 7 badges before I can catch anything actually worth training.This and Spyro Reignited are examples of perfect remasters. And i mean, you can walk with your Pokemon. What more could you want.I loved soulsilver version and felt that it was a well rounded game.  I enjoyed the 3D aspect and felt like it was a good nod towards the original even though I haven\\'t played the original.  It was a great game.perfect game. easily one the best pokemon games of all time, and is definitely the best remake. they actually did more than the bare minimum, unlike some really bad gen 4 remakes that came out recentlyPossibly the best Pokemon remake.It maintains the essence of the first editions, an amazing visual aspect, new content, the soundtrack updated to these times and a function to listen again to its original version, postgame huge ... in general it is all this, I have played so muchTime in my first game that I can\\'t erase it and start over.It is a game that shows the love and effort with every detail on, this is the Freak game that made me enjoy so much.i like this game. it is fun. good post game. good main game. good starters. serviceable plot. all it needs to have; nothing more, nothing lessPokemon SoulSilver is a remake of a classic 1999 Pokemon Silver and being released in 2010 for the Nintendo DS, it is a part of the fifth generation of the legendary Pokemon game franchise. Its twin version Pokemon HeartGold (remake of Pokemon Gold) was released at the same time in a classic Pokemon fashion. That is the thing about Pokemon games, they do not change. Each generation we get a bunch of new Pokemon, the towns have different names, but otherwise its the same. So every Pokemon game kind of feel like a remake. And still it somehow works very well. What can I say about the game? In terms of story, you know exactly what you are going to get, travel through Johto, collect badges, catch pokemon, beat the Champion, move to Kanto, repeat the process, bit of end game content, the end. Perfectly satisfactory. The graphics of these Gen IV / V Nintendo DS games are very likeable. Simple and yet very colorful and joyful plus you get the great atmospheric old school music. The one drawback with the Pokemon games that I often experienced was the low difficulty and the very easy way of making the game ridiculously easy by just training a single pokemon and overleveling everyone and everything else. But you can easily counter this yourself by going with full party. Also try changing the battle style option from shift to set and you might be surprised just by how much the difficulty will rise. Just for the record, I played on PC using the DeSmuMe emulator. Obviously no microtransactions or SJW politics are present in this game.\\n\\nGreat remake sticking to the tried and true Pokemon ways. Final Verdict: 90%This and Heartgold are very hard to find nowadays, considering the high chances of getting scammed with counterfeit copies... anyways, this game is bonkers. It has contest for around 400+ gameplay hours, if not more, if you want to finish everything the game has to offer. Best NDS title i ever owned.The beautiful, fun, definitive experience of the back then definitive pokemon game. It is just a little slow in battle.Pokémon Sword and Shield has come and gone and, though not as cataclysmically bad as many were anticipating, the game left a lot to be desired. Moreover, it seems to have gotten people thinking about what makes a Pokémon game great, and what fundamentally works with the series.\\n\\nThese \"findings\" seem to agree that Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are pretty much the platonic ideal of a Pokémon game. For one, they\\'re built off of the backbone arguably the series\\'s finest entry at the time, Pokémon Gold and Silver. They stuck to the respective games\\' various design layouts while also containing a few of the improvements and changes made in Pokémon Crystal, such as not having to chase Suicune around Johto. For another, it offers the most bang for your buck out of any of the games. Gold and Silver\\'s postgame consisted of little more than stomping around a miniature Kanto like Godzilla. It was neat, but far from substantial. Not only has Kanto been beefed up HeartGold and SoulSilver, but the game has even added Pokémon Platinum\\'s Battle Frontier for good measure, making for a beyond satisfactory reward for your hard efforts.\\n\\nBut really, what make HeartGold and SoulSilver so beloved are the little things. The fact that you can unlock an item that restores the iconic Gold and Silver OST, the improvements made to the series as a result of the jump from Gen 2 to Gen 4 as well as improved movesets overall, the iconic legendary events, most of which you can still access thanks to a recently discovered loophole, the fact that so much time and effort went into adding content to the campaign without sacrificing even a drop of the original game\\'s charm, there\\'s just so much attention to detail that makes Pokémon what it is.\\n\\nBut the biggest three factors that go into making this game so great are its most simple. First, Johto is the best region in the series, bar none. It\\'s the most thoughtfully designed, comfy, homey, quirky, and memorable. Sure, a massive tower dedicated to Bellsprout, a rather forgettable Gen 1 Pokémon wouldn\\'t have been first on most people\\'s list of ideas for a Pokémon game, but it\\'s the kind of strange inclusion that nobody knew they wanted, nobody expected, and yet so distinct and memorable that they kind of love it. As goes for places like the Slowpoke Well, the Lake of Rage, the Ruins of Alph, and  Sinjoh Ruins. Next is the strange, beloved feature of having your Pokémon follow you. On paper, it makes very little difference, but being able to turn around and watch your Pokémon do something silly and adorable just puts such a big, stupid grin on my face every time. Moreover, it fits perfectly in line with the recurring theme of the game, that there\\'s apparently just something special about Pokémon that elevate them from just pets or battle monsters, but apparently some kind of spiritual companion to humans.\\n\\nAnd lastly, there\\'s the Pokéwalker.\\n\\nI feel sorry for anyone that didn\\'t grow up with this peripheral. It was like Pokémon Go minus all the extra, pointless bullcrap. It was something you could take with you, this little token of your adventure that you can bring into the real world with you. It was cool almost beyond words, and it was a damn fine pedometer too. What\\'s more, you could catch Pokémon not normally available until far later in the game, like Pikachu, Murkrow, etc.Bro this game is my childhood. Only fond memories remain and I have no complains.It is fun to have the second generation Pokemon in a brand new console and advanced graphic performance.Simply the best Pokemon game..An incredible game first of all is the best set their Japanese atmosphere is incredible apart from that has a very good story since they give us a team rocket to the edge of the solution are so lost that they do not respect the original intentions of Team Rocket we haveTo the best Pokemon character next to N Silver a character with an excellent development and the final fight against incredible Red Uffffff later the difficulty is quite good although it has a very abrupt level rise in short is a gameLiterally, the best game on the ds this game is better than the new super Mario bros ds I literally have 40 hours of gameplay so far and I still have a ton of the game left to explore the sound is pretty good also it\\'s not the best but it\\'s very nostalgic. I really don\\'t recommend running this game on a computer as an emulator trust me it\\'s a crappy feeling it feels way better to play it on a 3ds/2ds.My first pokemon adventure. I feel very nostalgic about it. I\\'d like to replay it.Sub People Say This Is a Great Game, So Do I. You have 2 Entire Regions to Explore and Pokemon Up To Gen 4. It Speaks for Itself, Just Go Ahead and Play It.\\n\\nSome say this game is a game, me too.You have 2 entire regions to explore and Pokémon to the fourth generation.The game speaks for itself, simply play it.while i only just recently completed the johto side of the story it is amazing it has lots of charm i love pixelated graphics so i loved the graphics of this, johto feels complete and alive while i personally hate a lot of generation 2 pokemon i find that this game had made all the pokemon that much better in my opinion. i wouldn\\'t recommend it for people who just started pokemon because its so expensive, the only one i could find was in a neighboring city and it cost over 80$, but if you are a fan of the series i would absolutely recommend this.While the post game content is really enjoyable, earning 16 badges and a music box that plays 16 bit remixes, putting 16 hours into grinding for the Elite Four challenge is really annoying.… ExpandThe perfect expression in not only Pokemon, but gaming as an entity. Takes the broad strokes the prior games laid down and sweeps them up, aware this will be the cresting for the franchise: my God is it beautiful. Grew up with this game, will continue growing with this game, and will never leave it behind. Has become as intrinsic to me as water: Soulsilver flows through me like an essence, lighting up my body with flowers and wishes.This is really one of the best Pokémon games I’ve ever played. Being a remake of one of my favorite generations during my favorite generation I would’ve liked it no matter what. It plays like silver perfected and in most things have stayed the same but they have added a lot of nice features. Some of my favorite new features include the safari zone which allows you to catch Pokémon from gens three and four. I also like how there is a lot more focus on the story content this is seen especially with the big change that you now have to catch the legendary Pokémon before the elite four and new team rocket admin’s. Pokémon using their gen four move sets really helps in improving move diversity especially with the more challenging trainers. The pokeathon that is added included some nice touch mini games. So overall I love this game for being at the original but better.....................................................................................................................................................................................................blankThis is the only game I will give 10/10.\\nIn the DS era, Game Freak proved that they can do a lot more than they did in the GB era.\\nIn my opinion, remakes don\\'t always quite live up to the original, but this game proved that it can be done.\\nA beautiful pixel graphic that just looks a lot more alive than the 3D Pokemon offshoots, a beautiful soundtrack that goes straight to the heart and ear and not to forget the post game content in the Kanto region and the Gen 4 Pokemon that have been added.\\nIn my opinion it\\'s the best Pokemon remake ever.\\nIf you are looking for an unforgettable Pokemon adventure, you will find it in this gamePure soul I love the pokewalker and love totodile. Best pokemon game ever . 10/10lit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Pokémon Soul Silver, is one of the most beautiful Pokémon games (aesthetically speaking) that I have played of this great franchise, the scenery is fine, soft, enveloping, subtle and at the same time rude with the appropriate colors in the videos of automatic scenes.Its gameplay is very easy, and follows the same pattern of which Pokémon players are accustomed and familiar.90/100\\nThe pinnacle of the Pokémon series. Don\\'t need to say anything else.Playing Pokemon Soul Silver was a special experience I will never forget because you can tell that this games felt like the true vision Satoru Iwata had for Gold/Silver/Crystal, but could not do back then due to hardware limitations. (Iwata worked alone and overtime to get Kanto into Gold/Silver/Crystal, and would have been single region only if it were not for Iwata\\'s programing genius and effort.)\\n\\nIt takes everything that made those game timeless, and then adds more to make them even more timeless. These games are one of the rare Pokemon games to not grind to a complete halt after beating them thanks to both the Pokethlon and the Battle Frontier. After beating all the Kanto Gyms, you are treated to catching the Kanto Legendaries in Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, and Mewtwo that you had to trade from Gen 1 to get into Gen 2. After beating Red, you are able to catch the Gen 3 legendary Hoenn Climate Change beast Groudon, and Latios roams Kanto.\\n\\nOverall, Soul Silver reflects the intense passion of finally being able to do lwata\\'s true vision for Gen 2, and you can feel that passion in every aspect playing this game.\\n\\nThe one drawback that was outside of their control is that it is now a major pain to get enough coins to get prizes.… ExpandThe greatest Pokemon game ever made, except for the fact that it took the all blue female lead option and replaced her with generic skin 130.  So really the worst Pokemon game ever made.Pokémon Soulsilver recreates the world and experience of the original SIlver with a stunning amount of additions, modernizations and creative quirks that make this one of the best Pokémon games ever made. The original Silver was already packed with content thanks to the two regions and 16 gyms available, and the remake builds upon that even further incorporating the Crystal storylines, new areas, upgraded gyms with deeper level design, expanded story and Pokémon teammates following you on the field for immersion. So even though the core battle structure of Pokémon can be extremely repetitive and simplistic, this experience is nonetheless one of astounding content richness. Most notably, the new Pokéathlon facility hosts a rich selection of diversified action minigames, constituting a very fun breather from the usual gameplay. Lastly but not least, the Pokéwalker offers a revolutionary way to bring some of the game\\'s experience into the player\\'s real life routine, with a simple but extremely charming set of minigames and functionalities to make it work both on its own as a portable entertainment device and an immersive companion piece to the main game.Pokemon Soulsilver is one of the best games one could buy for the DS. It features a huge amount of pokemon to catch, great challenges in the face of the Frontier Brains and the best rival of any pokemon game. The downside is that it lacks the better features of later generations like the Mega Evolution and it takes a huge amount of time to actually get a pokemon with perfect stats.g oooooooooooooooooonmooon\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e\\u200e',\n",
       " 'Superliminal is a stimulatory puzzle game where you are being aided by a company to obtain better sleep and dreaming. As you progress it talks about you falling off of the orientation path. Starts initiating emergency procedures and you start receiving messages played on little boom boxes randomly located throughout the path and puzzles. All of the puzzles become a little more insane and stimulating as you progress throughout the game. As you progress you’ll also receive random quotes of wisdom from the boom boxes as you progress through the emergency procedures attempting to exit the dream state you have been progressing through. Not everything is a straight path or solution sometimes you are required to literally run in circles so be prepared. Perspective is everything in solving these puzzles, so if you like to challenge yourself and stimulate your brain look no further than Superliminal for your Xbox One console. If your a fan of past experiences like Portal then you’ll be right at home in the genre.Superliminal is a satisfyingly trippy game. It deserved better pacing and level design. It was missing a plot to give the experience more weight. I\\'d like to have seen more made of the mechanics. But as a whole, it\\'s a fun game and the puzzles are varied and surprising.What a masterpiece. Loved it. One of my favorite games ever. Clapped at the conclusion the same way I did in endgame part 2.Really fun gameS fun puzzle game not that hard nor that easy it balanced in between Highly recommend:)This game is unlike any other game I have ever played. It is constantly changing its gameplay mechanics forcing the player to consistently think outside of the box. The atmosphere of this game made me feel like someone was watching me the whole time. It\\'s unnerving and uncomfortable, but in a way that feels appropriate and unique. The levels and story are somewhat vague making most of the game ambiguous. This blends together nicely with the atmosphere and the ending. It almost feels like this game was made for me. I don\\'t know many other games that do such a great job capturing the oddcore aesthetic quite like this one with its liminal spaces and whatnot. I could go on and on about this game, but the less you know before playing the better. Never have I ever played a game that blew my mind quite like this one.Superliminal is a simple yet complex perspective based puzzle-game. It has plenty of charm and aims to tell a simple finite narrative. It\\'s a game that asks you to stick with it till the end and it will reward you for doing so.This is more or less like I don\\'t feel to attract but good if it is for me I do not recommend this game but in the end you decideGirl ndi.

The game will put a spin and twist on the main mechanic and it is enough to keep you guessing and refreshing until the end. Great voice acting too.It’s a kind of Portal puzzles… but without gates to tell the truth. And especially with puzzles that break your balls in five sec. So, as dry, we uninstall this stew and torch with it.\\n\\nIn short, no need to turn around the jar, it dries up this big shit and it is completely normal to tell the truth: it is only an indoor astronagement after all. In subjective view, of course and less naughty than the average of Indés but only 30 immo/s, including on new consoles. In addition, we feel that it raises more or less substantially, perhaps a concern for frame pacing or more likely an implementation of the very poorly implemented kinetic blur.\\n\\nAnd if it is less naughty than the average of indesible by-products, it remains technically very weak, surprisingly crenellated (the resolution seems very weak) and the artistic direction is not very artistic to say everything. Not to say bad taste or a blatant and regrettable lack of taste.\\n\\nIn short, this Astron spins the migraine and has no interest, except possibly for the Masos holes who like to be pissed off with this kind of shit, of course.It has a large amount of innovation and creativity put into this game. For one, the mechanic of reshaping objects based on perception, makes the game feel as innovative and fun as portal was. A true enjoyable experience that made me want to 100% it. Truly a great game.A good game to move your brains.But even the level of the Portal Games series is not close.At the beginning, it was more or less interesting with optical ilisions, cubism, etc.But in the second half of the game, the developers seem to end with a fantasy, the complete game was throughout the game, but at the end there was too much.You can get eplepsy.Dialogues of Glin Pierce are the most useless dialogues in the history of video games.Such non -informative nonsense.For unusual experience- 5.Mediocre thrash metal that doesn\\'t deserve such high ratings. I don\\'t know how such a large number of players, in principle, can like such a talentless and negligent project.Kavo and sho?Here are the questions that I have when I look at this something\"Liminal space\", the first time I heard this mentioned was when a buddy of mine shared a music video of Meshuggah. He said that the video made use of \"liminal space\". So I got curious and googled it to know that it means to \"be on the precipice of something new but not quite there yet. \". I didn\\'t stop there & looked at some uncomfortable images of this, genre? I guess. I assume it\\'s the same as surrealism but not quite. Anyway, I picked this game on Game Pass and I found it to be quite good at accomplishing what it sets to do. The level, puzzle and visual design is what stands out in this game. Great example of the use of space to evoke feelings in the player. For instance, when I accidentally scaled myself to a very small size, I felt this sense of dread that I remember feeling in my childhood when I imagined what it would be like to be that small! I unwillingly associated this dreamscape with some of my own memories and this gave it a personal aspect to my experience of playing it.\\nOverall, this game is recommended to anyone looking for a not so difficult and short Portal-esque experience. Although it may feel dull at times, but you won\\'t regret playing it.Holy crap this is a really good game! Was pleasantly surprised when I played through it, expected just another puzzle game but this one is insane with the perception views and puzzles. Highly recommend this. I normally dislike puzzle games but this game is awesome!Since I met portal I liked this type of 3D Puzzle games and I see in superliminal an original round trip and a good use of optical and lighting illations.He would put a 10/10 but I think he lacks optimization in the Xbox One s and the graphics could be better.Anyway an excellent game.Preto normal puzzles game, I do not understand that I have so many note by users.It is another one, another who plays with perspective.It is short and not very difficult, which is appreciated because it seems the continuation of many other puzzles games.I just recommend playing it if you love genreThis game absolutely changed my life. I played it one year ago, replayed it, and talk about it all the time. The ending had me in tears from the storyline. If you give up easily and don\\'t see it through, you won\\'t like it and won\\'t get the full effect. Play it all the way through. It is a true spiritual experience by the end of it and is graphically intense and beautiful. It embeds concepts of perseverance, perspective shifting, and mental health in a way that is so natural and non contrived. As a psychology doctoral student, this game felt like a dream I had years ago of someone creating a game to actually change your life and create a positive influence through a fun means that doesn\\'t even feel like you are creating change within yourself. It was frustrating at times of course, but isn\\'t everything worth anything in life hard? A fun puzzle game with the added bonus of feeling like you read a self help or mindfulness book. I recommend this game to everyone. Kudos to the developers!',\n",
       " 'Excellent! the drama between magnus and kliener was fun to watch. the puzzle to killing ratio was about the same as the rest, so its another masterpiece. although the crush every antlion grub achievement on steam has got to be the hardest one out there. also, someone commented on repetition of game play, well its not like a few weeks are going to change the complete game play just for this one game. And as a last comment i can\\'t believe i predicted the ending withing a few minutes of playing it.Like all HL series... Awesome!That\\'s the best game I have ever played!THE BEST GAME EVER!!!! Seriously, it\\'s kind of short, but the gameplay is excellent, the story is amazing, and the characters are incredibly believable. I know I became more attached to them than I should have, but I felt like crying when Eli was killed, that\\'s how involving this game is.The Half-Life series is awesome. Great soundtrack, great gameplay, good graphics (for their time), and jaw-droppingly good story. Much better than modern trashy FPS titles. Despite the fact that some of the \"comedic relief\" - as many call it - somewhat diminished the otherwise intriguing atmosphere of the Half-Life series, I can\\'t help but emphasize once again that it is still much better than modern trashy FPS titles. The Half-Life saga is pretty amazing. Give it a try.All I can say after finishing this game is.... WOW!!! Every single thing about it left my jaw hung open! Valve has impressed me yet again with their awesome ability to make such a great storyline, and with their limitless source engine. The ONLY problem i have with this game is that it is a little bit too short. Still, 10/10. I just wish that my jaw could have hung open just a little bit longer.The 2nd episode of the HL 2 series. Amazing. The story can be putted in a movie, i felt so inside of Freeman that i got so emotions several times and the environment it simply the best. Everything improved alot from Ep.1 ofering lots of content and very good puzzles. The end was sad thought and frustrating to me.  Im hopping that Valve finishes this game to see what happens to Alyx and Freeman, i wish they get married :PThe overall package of this addon is pretty good, Valve quality from beginning to end. No experiments, nothing too fancy, valve just kept on telling their story further and delivered more of what has already proven as very good.WOW. The first thing that blows my mind is the graphics. When i first played this, I literally stopped moving and all I could do was just look at how good the graphics are. For a 2007 game, holy **** brilliantly done Valve. The gameplay in this episode is intoxicating. The difficulty is FINALLY perfected in this game, with a constant challenge throughout the entire game (or at least enough interest to keep you going), and only one section where the difficulty really spikes.  And hOLY **** the music. Valve really knows where to put music in a video game, and when. The placement of the music brilliantly sets the tone for the gameplay. I don\\'t think I have ever played a game with better music than this game. I feel like Valve physically read my mind about what I wanted there to be in Ep. 2, and they delivered. HUGE HUGE changes in this game. The gameplay is radically different, where Ep. 1 is focused mainly on combat, in Ep. 2, combat is much more spread out and it\\'s mostly about navigating and trying to find your way. If you zoom out and look at the game layout, you\\'ll see that it\\'s pretty linear, but it does NOT feel that way in anyway. You\\'re doing all sort of things, holding off attacks, investigating buildings, outrunning choppers, destroying enemy positions, and finding secret caches. The game will switch from exploration, to fierce combat, instantaneously. You will NEVER EVER know what will happen next. The length of the game is astounding, for such a level of intensity. It is easily twice as long as ep. 1, and nearly 3x as interesting. You will not want to put this game down. However, the difficulty is STILL not perfected, and some encounters may cause your health to quickly diminish. The first time I played this, there was a part that I simply could not beat because my health was just simply too low, so I had to go back several saves, which was extremely aggravating, and even then, I STILL had enormous difficulty with the fight. My second time through the game however, I had not trouble at all. Overall, this is a masterpiece video game, and is far superior to ep. 1, and quite possibly, Half-Life 2 itself.As awesome as ever...my only gripe is the tease where you think you\\'re going to get to fly a chopper and then they kill off a major character! Grrrrrrrr. But great action, and I love that you get to drive a pieced-together old muscle car, and jump it across a chasm. Nice. Excellent combat as always, great physics and AI, and the plot just continues to get more interesting.Excellent story-telling, game-making, technological achievement in entertainment.I would give it 9.5 but I\\'m unable to set it there. The game continues the saga wonderfully, is a little short but for those who say \"it\\'s too similar\", it actually is improved: the AI, flashlight, breaking buildings, certain render features, etc. It isn\\'t as groundbreaking as some games are soon likely to be, but it does what it\\'s made to do very well.Visually stunning, the source engine continues to evolve and provides wonderful scenery and backdrops as you race to save earth with the iminant portal always looming in the background. The open areas are a real treat and makes you want to jump out and explore all the niches and crevices as u drive along. Episode 2 definately brings back the impact half life 2 originally had, lots of neat puzzles, intense fights, great AI and important progress in the wonderful story that is Half life. I\\'d definately play this through again, there was enough new \\'stuff\\' to entertain the creative but intact is what Gordon Freeman is all about, blasting zombies, bugs and rising up against all odds. Episode one was good, Episode 2 will have you craving for more. Least to say, it was worth the wait. Definate two thumbs up, great job Valve.Episode 1 was disappointing because it added nothing new to the HL2 series. It was boring, linear and 4 hours long and really added nothing. Episode 2 however...my god...this is what I\\'m talking about. Episode 2 adds new outdoor environments, enemies and a cinematic story and REALLY feels like an addition to the series because it feels fresh and adds new things not seen in HL2 & Episode 1. When we played HL2 4 years ago, we were amazed at how fresh the game was, never having played anything like it before. Episode 2 feels the same. It\\'s great fun and you won\\'t want to stop playing until you\\'ve finished (unlike Episode 1). Graphical improvements have also been added and the environments just look amazing. It\\'s also twice as long as Episode 1 (about 7-8 hours). This game truly feels polished today, just like HL2 did in 2004. Episode 1 however does not which feels like the same HL2 from 2004.It\\'s just the best part of the Half-Life series. Great experience, original gameplay, better dialogs and characters. I loved it all.First of all I am not a valve fanboy, and outragous rating of this game thouraly angered me. The half life series has to be one of the most origanal and different ever to be created. The story line completely took me in, the visual effect leaps out at you like no other game. Valve has no been repetitive with the half life series, Valve is a gaming company that is not afraid to differ from the happy little feel good games such as call of duty! And I\\'m sorry mr. Hlep U but frankly all of the games in theorange box were utterly brilliant! Portal made you think beyond the level of other puzzle games. If you want something a little different and fun then where else to look but team fortress 2, it offers a fun experiense with a feel good cartoony style, and i\\'m sure you already know about the outright brilliance of hl2 and it\\'s succesers! And I\\'m sorry if I right now am sounding like a Valve spokesman, but the only way the orange box could have possibly made any better a deal was if they had included left 4 dead.Incredible, it\\'s cinematics are becoming more similar target with a TV show than an FPS, and it actually revealed a bit about the G-man for a change.I liked HL2 and EP 1 but EP 2 is one of the best FPS I\\'ve ever seen...This is a game as only VALVe can deliver. Buy it.Half Life 2 is a must get game for gamers.I really like the Antlion Invasion to protect the Vort and Alyx.Really Fun.I also like the Zombine, too.Puzzles are a little frustrating, but you get them some time.I also liked the Antlion Guardian, bossfight.… ExpandReally Half Life 2.2 is the best Half Life i\\'ve ever played . End scene was at it\\'s best and one of the best end scenes . Story and Screenplay were awesome . Game was of complete satisfaction . Waiting for it\\'s next installment . \\'Half Life rocks and so as VALvE\\'.I was very disappointed after playing through episode one.  My expectations were very high from Half Life 2.  Episode two however was no disappointment at all.  It held up to my expectations; carried the story line well, and played even better in parts than the original.  There are a couple of scenarios that had me jumping out of me seat in fear-full anticipation.  I hope they do more of the same for the final episode.A very good game! A variety of characters, enemies, weapons, and environments to come across in this game. The story line is amazing, you play as Gordon Freeman who was in the original Half - life( which was amazing too) and was in Half life episode one, and half life 2. This game has a horror,action, and drama like game-play style. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a good cheap game to play for hours.HL2 episode 2 picks up from where episode 1 left off and introduces new sort of areas to the series. Episode 2 mostly takes places in cavern and rural areas as opposed the city. Apart from that, it doesn\\'t offer any other new elements to the basic gameplay or the feel of the game, so most stuff is pretty much the same and holds up to a very high standard set by HL2 and HL2 ep 1. Some new additions are a new type of enemy, the Hunters, and also the final battle opens up an additional use for the Gravity Gun, which is pretty fun. There were some action scenes which were incredibly epic and I\\'d say perhaps some of the best and most intense gunfights I\\'ve ever witnessed in a video game (like the defence against antlion waves, first ever gunfight with the hunters, and the inn scene). Episode 2 is significantly longer than episode 1, but is still only about half the length of the original HL2, so should take approximately 6 hours of total playtime. The game ends on a very sharp note, pretty much a cliffhanger I\\'d say, and so it\\'s highly likely the story will continue in episode 3. However episode 3 is still unheard of.well what can i say, each episode is better than the next that\\'s because its like a story in a book that ends leaving you waiting for the next episode to come out.  this game has great mechanics, a story that keeps you on edge, Weapons that need to be used accordingly, and a story that just sucks you right in. Good job Valve you haven\\'t made a bad game yet at least not that i can recall.Even though i played it first 7 years after its initial release, i enjoyed the game thoroughly due to its beautiful marrying of story-telling and pacing.  Sounds simple, but most games (almost all) miss this masterful harmony in their gameplay.  Half-Life 2: Episode 2 does not let you rest until you finish it - always on the brink, always hurried on, always on the move, and always inside the story - i as a player loved the experience.It\\'s utterly amazing how Valve made Half-Life 2 : Episode Two. A brilliant storyline, the best gameplay in a Half-Life game - ever. An often funny, often sad storyline that amazes me. Half-Life 2 : Episode Two is a must buy. It\\'s a game that you will never regret buying. Fantastic voice acting work from Merle Dandridge - as always. Also brilliant performances from Hal Robins, Robert Guillaume and so many more (Including a \"friend\" of mine, John Patrick Lowrie, and his wife Ellen McLain) I cannot in any way fault the brilliant gameplay, voice acting, soundtrack or storyline. Honestly. You can also look forward to epic fight scenes which I absolutely love. They\\'re a challenge, but when you finish them - you feel like Gordon Freeman. The one free man.Valve will never cease to amaze me... and will never cease to take my money for its amazing games. This game is the second part to Half-Life 2: Episode 1. The story is continued and the graphics are the same as the first half. definitely worth buying like always.Truly a masterpiece of its time. Excellent pacing. something games from all future generations can look back too. While I have enjoyed this one extremely, i still can\\'t help but feel it lacks something. I have given it a 10, because, try as i might i can not think of what it is lacking. So, i am just guessing it is a proper ending, which will hopefully be in the next episode/game. Curse valve and their epic cliffhanger.Once again, a new episode in the Half-Life saga is here.\\n\\nThe plot in the Episode Two continues right after the ending of Episode One, and features more characters and even more locations.\\n\\nThe action is set as a desperate stab to stop the combine forces.\\n\\nAfter Citadel\\'s explosion, there\\'s been created a massive super portal, but not at is maximum capacity, and you must stop it from fully opening.\\n\\nIn the journey you\\'ll find new characters, both friendly and enemies, such as Acid Antlion Worker, Antlion Guardian, the hot new addition from Episode One, Zombines, Combine Hunters, and you\\'ll have your first face-to-face(but not a duel) with the Advisors.\\n\\nHalf-Life Universe is one of the richest Sci-Fi worlds ever created, and feels the closest universe after an Alien Invasion.\\n\\nEpisode 2 features brand new locations, new vehicles such as the Muscle Car.\\n\\nIn game play terms, well, the game still feels and plays like an Half-Life game, with many changes, such as more drama an tensioned conflicts, suspense, and a really great experience,  in visual terms the things are even better as well. As the Episode One did, the new episode comes with a greatly updated engine, featuring updated High Dynamic Range Lightning( HDR Short), brand new shaders, particle effects, an physics.\\n\\nLike the previous Half-Life 2s, Episode Two contains Achievements, which are a welcome thing, for all type of players, from hard to easy, from newbies to professionals, and even more puzzles.\\n\\nEpisode Two has everything needed for an sequel, by adding important and great things, and not making the game too different to it\\'s roots, and like the previous Half-Life games, it\\'s a must-own.Nice told with Alyx\\n\\nHALF-LIFE 2 EPISODE 2 starts immediately where Half-Life 2 Episode 1 ended. Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance must continue their fight, alongside the resistance, against the evil Combine. After the ever so slightly below par Episode 1, Episode 2 is a real return to form. Everything that was so good about HL2 is developed here and made even better. The narrative arc is strong, the dialogue well-written and witty, the voice acting accomplished and convincing, the environments spectacular and varied, and the mix between puzzle solving and combat just right. We meet several new enemies and some of the combat is pretty challenging, especially the final battle which is big on scale and mayhem and requires real strategy to complete. It’s a tough finale but well worth the effort. There’s so much to enjoy in the whole Half-Life series I can’t recommend these games enough.Silly hunters! While half life 2 had some minor flaws in the pacing (specifically in chapters like Root Kanal and Water Hazard) i think this game was paced perfectly and beautifully. The original HL and HL2 were challenging but, this game is also pretty challenging. And the ending battle with mini striders and striders was just magnificent. Still waiting on episode 3...It\\'s absolutely amazing. More detail was put into everything against Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode: 1, combined. The physics are better, the story is better well written, for an episode, and it\\'s more of a challenge. For even today, for 2007 graphics you still can\\'t help but be indulged into this world that was crafted by Valve. Now I will stand here and wait patiently for episode 3..... I mean, how long can it take to develop?This is personally one of my favorite games. I can\\'t wait for 3, much like a lot of people. Game was shorter than it should be but gets the story across. 10/10.Like HL2 in core mechanics, but better overall, in my opinion. The rebels feel full of life, rather than just tools to use in killing the combine. They have important parts in the story, conversations, and generally just feel more like real people. The final boss was incredibly challenging, but not impossible, as the game teaches you exactly what to do. Just how a final boss should be. There\\'s comic relief here and there to pep up the dark atmosphere. The G-Man is as mysterious as ever. There\\'s exploration. This game is fantastic.Excellent, one of most exiting games ever, from the beginning to the end is a master piece.  All in this game is designed to make us fall in the story, feel what Gordon Freeman feels, that\\'s hard to get, but Valve did it with this game, congrats, and if you haven\\'t played the half life saga let\\'s do it right now!  is one of the best video games ever created.Why did I come back to play this again. WHY?  I\\'ve never had such conflicting feelings after completing a game. I\\'m still amazed by what how masterfully done this is which makes me even more frustrated and sad at the fact that we\\'ll never see its continuation. It\\'s painful. I just. I Can\\'t. UghhhhhhhhhhhhAnother masterpiece Valve has created in their franchise! More epic storyline, more compelling moments, and more plain awesome fun! But this can\\'t be the final Half-Life game! Where are you Episode 3!? How can this game franchise end with such a major unsolved story plot, and a whole new adventure waiting! But keep praying that the defining day in video game history will come when Half-Life: Episode 3 is released! But still all the games are memorable and awesome in their own right!HALF-LIFE SAGA ENDS HERE. 1998-2007. R.I.P.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I LOVE Half-Life series. FOREVER. But VALVE....Where is my, our, 3?\\n\\nTHREEEEEEEEEEEE?\\n\\nGive us episode series at least 3, 4, 5, 6 and then give us Half-Life 3. And more. With PERFECTION in every aspects. Then maybe we will forgive you guys. Maybe....\\n\\n...PLZ.Half Life 2 Episode Two is the second episode of Half Life 2, published and developed by Valve Corporation. The game happens right after Episode one, following the path of Gordon and Alyx lu the White Forest base Lambada resistance. They are destroying the organization Combine Citadel used to open a portal, they hope to send a portal to invade. The game is better than Episode One, more and more content and events like another atmosphere. I guess now I\\'ll be one of those and I\\'ll cry all forums, want Half Life 3.Excellent game, substantially different than the previous Half-Life games so it\\'s not repetitive like many episodic games out there, excellent AI, graphics, storyline for the time.Despite that Episode One was really nice, it was clear that it was not the best part of the journey. Episode Two is definitely nicer than Episode One, in every aspect, also because it is in this chapter that really puts an end to the story of Half-Life 2. The story was great, and the ending is really one of the best moments in the history of video games. An ending from which we expect a sequel since a very long time now, in which I personally still have not lost hope, no matter how tough.When I finished this game, I cried for more. But sadly, I\\'m probably not going to see more of these. WHY VALVE? Just don\\'t leave us with a cliffhanger!Played it on a PS3. Episode Two is easily my favorite entry in HL2, it has the highest highs and is a very complete experience in its gameplay and story. As you may know, the story ends with a cliffhanger but an incredible and organic one, I think that is worth to play the whole series just to get to this episode and let\\'s hope that HL3 or Episode three happen soon.Half Life 2 Episode Two exceeds any and all expectations and manages to be the best of all of the Half Life games.This game must have been open world.The last level of the game is impressive.However, the rest of the experience is the same lived of the previous two Half Life.In addition the graphic engine is already starting to be quite outdated.But the game has a very good story and the gameplay, although simple, it manages to do it well.\\nI also criticize the existence of load times.It is something that should have been removed.Half-Life 2 Episode 2. That\\'s a lot of 2s and to be exact it\\'s two 2s... Weird.Episode 2 felt superior to the first episode in almost every way. Valve nailing the environments and story once again and the ominous feeling throughout this episode continues until the breathtaking ending. Half-Life 2 Episode 2 was a very fitting entry in the franchsie and putting it alongside portal in the orange box made it even better. I think episode two surpassed some of the design choices in Half-Life 2 and the soundtrack (while leaving you wanting more) is as deep and mesmerizing as always. Episode 2 is more great Half-Life 2 but remember... After playing this entry you will enter a lasting depression until the final episode of Half-Life 2\\'s story occur. Have FUN.Much better than the first episode and that is saying a lot, considering this is an expansion it provides a lot of content and if you are a fan of the original you already own and beat this haha, but if you are not consider getting the original and both addons, you won\\'t regret it.Everything I have come to expect from Valve, repetitive puzzles, similar action sequences throughout, and BY GOD DO I LOVE IT!The gameplay and story pick up in this one, but carrying that stupid gnome through the whole game is a bugger. Still, it\\'s a good game in its own merit, with great level design as usual. Worth playing even if you haven\\'t played HL2 or Ep. 1.This game is Great the combat feels fresh even tho its an old game and it makes you think on your feet. my only problem is some of the bits get a bit repetitive like killing the Hunters and Striders outside white forest, apart from this i have no problem with this game and its worth buying. :)10/10 = Masterpiece = This add on is YET ANOTHER masterful game from the makers of Half life and Portal. You guys are too damn smart.Actually my favorite game of all time. My username says it all. I know it is an expansion, i don\\'t care i just love it. I think people kind of neglect this game when mentioning great games because of its humble expansion pack existence. The graphics and story are excellent, especially the way characters act. The gameplay is much better than half life 2 because the gunplay is much better and battles are more well set upI didn\\'t like Half Life 2, but enjoyed Half-Life 2: Episode One. Episode Two, however, I think is a great game. This one, unlike the previous Half Life 2 games, is extremely fun to play with full of breathtaking moments. It is also the only one I totally enjoyed shooting -especially at the striders in the final chapter-. The story also seems to be more focused. At the end, I would not consider myself as an Half Life fan but it was a blast to play this final entry to the series.Great game! But too short for money!Really quite saddened by how this game turned out. The latter portion was incredibly boring, and the story seemed to drag. This was quite the shame as Episode 1 was very entertaining.Game won\\'t run. Keep getting \\'You do not have permissions to run HL2\\' and can\\'t get it to work at all. All in all the experience has left me annoyed and out of pocket. A complete waste of time and money.It would be a ten if it weren\\'t for the fact that certain things seem ripped off. The \"Striders\" look like the things from \"War of the Worlds\", the aliens use humans to build their army, kind of like \"Quake\". Everything other than that was amazing though.Has the experience for gamers to play.If you\\'ve played half-life2, much of this plays like a re-run. I thought way too much has been done in the previous games, and was just recycled here. I give it an 8 for the characters, both major and minor, and the visual and audial quality.They improved so much from half life 2 , graphics are awsome.. the only disadvantage is that the start is really slow and long.. and really got bored killing antilions for 2 hours.Good game, nice graphics, only... it\\'s a litle bit short for it\\'s price. Perhaps, give less attention to the graphic layout (because it\\'s very good now!) and give more attention to make the game longer. Looking forward for episode 3.Best Game Ever!!!!TOO SHORT!!! It is good as the game play is concerned but it ends before it really starts. When I finished the forest battle I expected it to continue, instead I saw a lame ending. Come on Valve, make the third one last as long as original HL2, you owe your fans at least that much...Only single player campaign played. This game series is overrated by today\\'s standards. First two or three chapters were okay and fun to play but chapters four through seven where sort of lumped together. I don\\'t believe there was anything to do in the last chapter but move Gordon and watch the ending. Shame. I suspect the developers lost interest half way through and just wound it up as fast as they could. And now we have the final third part to look forward too--boring.Although an acceptable foray in its own right, all the set pieces and puzzles have been done previously, it is still completely linear and just adding time pressure to the battles left me unimpressed. The only piece of story that really made me want more is delivered near the end, which highlighted the vacuum of the previous 4 hours gameplay. It is under 5 hours playtime, including plenty of exploring, with most of the achievements unlocked on the first try. This is only worth your the money if bought as part of the orange box.Still Half Life (2), but the weakest of the series. Lots of attempts at a story, with a decent script and still the same terrific voice acting. But the gameplay is old, and this was the most boring of the lot. Same old same old. The weapons and characters feel familiar, but there are no new things to entice us. There are the usual types of HL2 firefights, and an incredibly annoying end \"crescendo\" battle, thats not really fun, just plain irritating. I\\'ve played it through 3 times, thinking that it would grow on me with time, but it hasn\\'t. As a MASSIVE Half Life series fan, I was supremely disappointed with this installment. Episode 1 was pretty thin, but it was nice to be engaged in in the HL story again. This time, it was like a weak movie sequel, just giving us enough to want to come back again to see what happens next. Its too bad actually, that the Valve folks took this route, instead of building us a game that really took us somewhere. Delivering little tidbits like this every year looks good on paper, but the way things are going, we all might forget about this series next time aroundNot worth $29.95, even the mod Minerva is better and it\\'s free. Ep 2 ant-lion and strider arcade sequences are boring, crawling through underground tunnels reminds me of all the vent pipe crawling in earlier Half-Life games.Too short, battles were not balanced.Awfully short for the waiting time. Nothing new, and incredebly noobfriendly.Way,way too short.While the game itself is great the few levels and very short episode was very disapointing for the cost I would have expected a few more levels.Half life 2 episode 2, is half a game, it is no good bringing out a block buster such as half life 2 and then the excellent episode 1, just to be followed by half games to drag out the story for as long as possible !! Sequels are bad enough, with those you can get away with 3 or 4 , but this episode thing, with what we have been given in the 2nd episode, compared to episode 1 or the oriignal half life 2, it seems that we are getting less and less with each stage and just how many half games/episodes are there going to be. The battle with the stalkers would have made a brilliant half way stage and quite frankly I was gutted to have only about 5 minutes after that left and that was it....Robbed, where was the reward for such a battle (another year wait for more half life ?)  !! Half a game , Half a score I\\'m afraid. I played half life 2 and ep1 many , many times over. No need to play ep2 again really, not much to see ! Just decided it earns a 3 not a 5 !! Valve....Reinvent and bring us a Revelation for ep3 !I thought the game was too short for the money that it cost to purchase and the time since episode 1.  The game \"Portal\" that was bundled with Episode 2 was much more thought out and compelling.  \\nThe storyline did not progress very far and few plot \"milestones\" were achieved.\\n\\nThe gameplay was not that much different than Episode 1 and I am not sure I understand why this game took so long to produce because it had the feel of an expansion pack.Overpriced, over hyped, too short and is obviously a part of a larger, mythical game, called \"half-life 2.5\", which is made up of all three \"episodic\" releases. Seriously, $30 for a small expansion with 5 hours game-play is a lot when you think of the price of the original. If they know something, it\\'s how to milk. They\\'re gonna milk this one dry, Valve.Maybe I am just spoiled, but there was almost nothing new... some great set pieces, but cut scenes took the game more into the realm of a film that you could take part in most of the time. Very short too...i was so disappointed it was all over in a day, basically, even on hard setting. graphics, story, acting all brilliant as ever, but it just felt it was a bit of a game in every way. and WHY DO ALL THE ZOMBIES HAVE WHITE SWEATERS....come on valve, a bit of imagination on that point - so small a point, but so rubbish at the same time.This was not a very entertaining game for me. Lots of open yet redundant open space; there was no need to explore them since there was nothing there except empty crates. As I went through the game, I saw alot of crates that were used as filler space. Old broken cars used as filler space is understandable; an overturned truck that carried empty is not. I felt no connection to my so-called companion, Alyx; she seems immortal: she hardly dies, and she can kill stuff with her pistol and infite ammo. I also felt that the introduction of new enemies were too litte too late in the series and that game mechanics didn\\'t change. The story adds new characters and facilities out of the blue and magically erases others. The player is supposed to get to the Scientist Magnusson at White Forest Base (the character and location weren\\'t materialized until now) to give a packet of information to him (which was acquired in episode 1). A sense of urgency and the importance of the data packet were being conveyed throughout game; I did feel the importance of urgency throughout the game. There is also no nightime when the player is outside; the player goes into dark undeground areas, but it is assumed that it is daylight. This lack of nightime in a story where everything happens chronologically is severely detracting from the mood and sense of urgency. Tha achievements were alright, added some replayability value, but not much. I also didn\\'t enjoy the sense of constant praise from Alyx and resistance members.I hated this esp was way to sort all this is about is the girl dying and brining her to life and her dad dying and thats it...was nothing based from the explosion or anything just stupid sinceless sht i didn\\'t care about.This is the original advertising campaign. \"Half Life 2: Adventures of Gordan Freeman and the Crappy Unnecessary Character: Part 2\" By now, if you actually enjoyed Half Life 2 up to this point, we can throw just about anything at you. How about? The same puzzles. How about? One new Enemy with slightly updated AI. How about? A storyline that actually requires you to study and worship Half Life to sort of understand. How about? More awkward situations to the point of unrealism. How about? The final, not boss, Bosses be very overly complicated to defeat and leaves room for hours of frustration. Now we know how much our fans like the same old formulas. So, get this, we actually make it into a package deal. With one, count them, one good game in the package deal. Its called Portal or something....us valve teammembers are against games that make you think but we\\'ll let this one slide. We can\\'t call it something generic like \"Valve Fanboy Package\" we\\'ll make it the \"Orange Box\" which is like the mating call for all Valve fanboys. I hope you come to enjoy our repackaging of Half Life 2 as much we enjoy half a**ing everything.Meh. HL2 was replayable. HL2: episodes 1 and 2 are fun once and then they can go back in the box. Most levels in this game are boring shoot em up and little strategy.Real disappointment. Little story and even smaller amount of having to think. Seemed to be more of a game suited for ten year olds. The story line was amateurish at best and the final fight scene was just downright repetitive and boring. I thought I was only about half way through and was shocked that that was the end of this segment. $50 was WAY too much for a too short game and for the bastardization called TF2. I\\'m just glad that a mod team made a good TF called Fortress-Forever! Probably just have to leave TF2 for the kidz. If Portal wasn\\'t included I would have given the orange box a rating of 2.It may be a little short and it makes a slow start, but the second half of the game is simply amazing. It deserves for me a 9,5 but if I have to choose between 9 and 10 I prefer the last. I hope Episode Three will be available as soon as developers can!The 3 is only because I\\'m a Half-Life junkie. It\\'s not worth the price of the orange box. Here are my main gripes with the game: The wide open spaces that you can travel about in this game are just that - wide open spaces with nothing in them. There\\'s a goal to reach and not too many paths to reach it. It\\'s like being in an amusement park that covers one square mile and has a single ride. To make matters worse, much of the open space is traversed while driving. Valve has made no improvements to the driving experience since HL one. This means that the vehicle drives like a pickup truck on ice with an on/off switch on the gas and brake. The driving is also monotonous. You get to drive through a few boxes, stop for some supplies, and run into an enemy or two. Over and over. My other problem is with the gravity gun. Every puzzle and enemy can be beaten with only the gravity gun. Pick up a piece of debris and chuck it at a bad guy. Move an object out of your way. Repeat about a thousand times. You can let Alex do almost all of the shooting with her limitless supply of ammo and good aim. The achievements are also a bit lame. Kill a bunch of grubs and get a prize. Beat a few hunters and get a prize. Whoopee. I\\'m not going to play back through to get the ones I missed. The game is fun once through, but I think the linear game-play limits this to a once-through title. I\\'m almost at the end of the game and I see this as not much more than added levels to HL 2. The actual fighting can be fun and the weapons are cool, if you choose to use them. Alex ruins the game in many places since you can just let her do the shooting and launch a tire or two to help out when she gets overwhelmed. The same can be done with most of the companions that help throughout the game. I paid full price for the orange box just for this game. I wish I would\\'ve waited until someone else beat it and bought their copy at a reduced price. this isn\\'t worth $50.I don\\'t think it\\'s necessary this episode to the saga. it\\'s all the same bu**sh** make an new \"Monster\" or a Human against you like \"G-Man\" not the same crap every time. But the graphs are good to me. 5.This is a must-buy expansion for people who liked Half-Life 2. The story keeps unfolding without any plot twists that would alienate fans. The first part of EP2 is full of action, though it is undeniably corridor-to-corridor linear. The second part does what Half-Life 2 does best - Mixing action, puzzles, and scripting. In case you need to understand how it works, let me share an experience. The Combine raided a missile silo, and I need to shut the doors in order to prevent any more Combine from entering in. Unfortunately, at the switch, they set up a turret. I sprint past the turret, leaving me with 90 health. I then grab my crossbow, move a bit from my cover, and snipe the soldier\\'s head. To my dismay there is another Combine, and he manages to shoot me . I escape, but now I have 3 health. I see a health pack, but in order to grab it I need to get out of cover again. I instead push it off using a nearby box and the gravity gun, and drag it over to gain some more health. I then use the box to hide my presence while I sneak to another room. I take out a Combine there, and then open the door, shotgun in hand, and blast that last guy. I shut the door, but I use the turret to fend off all other invaders. THE REASON WHY IT DOESN\\'T HAVE A 10 IS BECAUSE OF THE ENDING. No, unlike most games, it\\'s not a plot twist that is disappointing. It\\'s just so annoying, and the AI doesn\\'t help either.This episode has very good game play and story, but it is way too short. I really hoped for longer episode than the first and its 4 hours long. On the other hand i think this episode had better story and game play than episode 1.I gave HL2 a 9 because it\\'s one of my favourite games of all time, but I gave Episode 2 a 7 becouse it doesn\\'t carry the greatness of HL2 and it\\'s even less fun and just as short (or even shorter) as Episode 1. i\\'m not saying it\\'s bad, just saying it\\'s not as good as HL2.So, it\\'s simply Half Life 2 with 2 new (great)  enemies.\\nI finish it in 5 hours (hard mode).\\nEpic moment but the same thing than Half Life 2.\\nAnd I ask to fans  The game of the decade  Really ?\\nYes Episode 2 is like HL2  a good game but the best game ever  Certainly not (for me)I played a total of seven hours into this and completed it, But two of those hours was dealing with crashing/freezing at main menu and in the middle of gaming , subtitle glitches, Character model glitches, texture glitches and many more. This Episode does have good Levels and memorable moments and a good set off for Half-Life 3, But the Glitches destroyed this for me.Much better than the original second part.Valve will never make Half-Life 3 which is why I give this game a 0. The game itself is meh.This and a masterpiece I recommend that you play it!\\nThe graphics and good to be a game of 2007.\\nAnd the gameplay is fantastic.good games good games good games good good games good games good games good ..Just like ep1 this brings nothing new to the table, it is too same and short.Really loved the story line, even liked it more that zombies weren\\'t the the most npc\\'s that gave you trouble. I\\'ll give it an 10 for story line and that alyx is with you 80% of the game instead you doing everything alone.An excellent chapter of the half life saga, well told and acted; as well as offering loads of eye candy. my advice would be to wait with playing until closer to episode 3, or you\\'ll be hungering for more.It sticks to the true story and form of the original. Game flows smoothly and action is alway awaiting around the corner. Just as good as the original.This is even better and better, will there be a Episode 3 THEN I WILL PLAY :DMuch better than ep1 (only because ep1 can be completed in 2- 30 minutes). Though this game\\'s ending was left completely open (for ep3) it takes quite a bit longer to complete. Graphics are amazing (especially the car scenes through the forest) Definitely worth he money! I actually didn\\'t feel bad for buying this episode.. Nice challenging tasks ... YOU\\'LL LOVE IT!!!!It\\'s a little bit on the \"more of the same\" side but very much worth it.',\n",
       " 'Portal was what sold me on the concept of the orange box, honestly. The concept behind portal greatly intrigued me to begin with. When I finally downloaded it off of steam and played it, I was not disappointed.\\n\\nThe game starts out slowly, teaching you about portals, and the tutorial goes by quite smoothly. It was during this tutorial that I first learned about the awesome that is the AI \"GLaDOS\". GLaD\\'s comments became increasingly more amusing as time went on, and nearing the end, she only became better. The ending, too, was truly satisfying. Few games end with a specially made song. Especially such a catchy one.\\n\\nThe combination of fun gameplay, fun story, and the best AI ever (Shodan can\\'t even hold a candle to GLaDOS) propell this game to be.. well... among the best games I\\'ve ever played. My only problem is how short it is. Not worth 20, necessarily, but as part of the orange box, it is quite worth it, and I strongly encourage people to play it. Remember, the cake is a lie.I am here to explain to anyone who dosen\\'t like this game why they\\'re wrong. *The game is short. Damn agreed. *It holds your hand through the entire game Dowload maps, they are fun and provide you with infinite playtime. *The \"puzzles\" are not really puzzles Agreed, but read above. *the humour is terrible. Are you from this planet man?the best games of all time ! valve comes through again with a game i could not set down ! 2.5 hours of pure fun and addiction. a perfect world setting and use of there physics engine level layout and story, with a perfect twist. not to forget there computer voiced narrator that adds a few well placed lols.\\ni cant wait for the sequals.. im not going to ruin ..but those who have played and beat the HL2 series. specificly episode 2 ill know what im looking forward too.Holy crap, I\\'ve never been so addicted to a game in my LIFE, and I\\'ve played hundreds of \\'em! I literally could not leave my computer until I had beaten it and figured out all the puzzles for myself.... AMAZING gameplay, and quite humorous as well, I might add! (listen to \"Still Alive\" during the credits....lol!).This game is completely underrated by the media. Yes, the main storyline is only about 3-4 hours long. But, the advanced modes provide *many* extra hours of fun. I keep going back to this game because it\\'s so fun to experiment with - I wonder if someone will add the portal gun to Gary\\'s Mod (maybe they have already!).  Also, the story to this game is great.It may just be that the humor is an exact fit for mine, but this was one of the most hilarious games I\\'ve ever played.  Just amazingly good from a plot/naration standpoint and the game itself, the puzzles, the portals, are tons of fun.  I really wish it were longer.  Maybe a sequel!  The cake is a lie!!Pure genius. The most innovative, funny, fun, FPP (First Person Puzzler) ever. The corperate rags are clueless about what a blast this game is for gamers. From the twisted, oddly endearing AI GLaDOS, to the truly unique puzzels that requirer fine motor skills, and out side the cubical thinking. Not to forget it\\'s a bonus game. Here\\'s to Valve, and a Grammy for Still Alive. Get it. Play it, and life will never be the same.This game was crazy fun. It took me a few minutes, as well as a few tries, to figure out some of the puzzles, but I got them all eventually. Very fun to make a portal on the ceiling and the floor and fall continuously. The only way this game could have been more fun is if it was an online multi-player shooter. (wink wink nudge nudge)Aaaahhh....I can\\'t remember when I last loved a game more. Actually loved a game. Sure, it\\'s short, but it\\'s also brilliantly original, incredibly intuitive, hard without being enraging, and most importantly it\\'s the funniest game since Ron Gilbert\\'s Good and Evil was released in a just and fair parallel universe. I hereby nominate Ellen McClain for an Emmy, or something. Oh, and a Grammy. All games should give you this much actual delight. Play it. Play it twice. And when the credits have rolled, let the menu screen play out for about thirty seconds. Trust me.Absolutely amazing!\\n\\nIt starts off a little slow, especially if you\\'ve already played Narbacular Drop or played with the portal gun in Garry\\'s Mod.  After the intro levels, the puzzle action really gets interesting, and you start getting sucked into the game quite a bit.\\n\\nThe story is pretty simple, but there is a ton of character, a few surprises, and a great ending.  Plus, even after you finish the game, there are bonus levels and challenge modes to keep you coming back for more!The Portal team certainly deserves a standing-O for their work on this game. This was a Triumph! I encountered no bugs. I could have finished it sooner, but I enjoyed taking time to search through each possible move. I hope Valve makes more maps for Portal, and releases a map editor. Hey how about 3 Portals at once... Thank You Portal Team, for this enrichment center activity. Now I\\'m going to have some Cake!The game does deserve a 10. It´s short but if you look at it as an extra to the entire HL2 collection you get on the Orange Box - I´ll say its a fantastic surprise.\\nPlus, the game as a story, a really deep one.: there is obcessive passion from a machine with sentimental dislexia and you kill your best friend (I´m missing you crazy, Companion Cube...) THE CAKE IS NOT A LIE!The \"official\" website reviews, I\\'d say, are drastic understatements. This game marries wonderfully joyful gameplay with an intruiging story that will leave you wanting to finish it the moment you begin the game. Along with that, the humour incorporated is simply golden and there are moments where we can really laugh out loud. Also, its 3 hour long lifespan, to me, is very appropriate. Too long and the game would have lost its novelty. With all that said, it was honestly the best 3 hours of my life. Do not miss this masterpiece.Portal is truly an unassuming kind of game, what with it\\'s seemingly simple story and the lack detail. However, the further you go, the more eerie things get, with a good twist and some ingenious ideas. I would have appreciated some more \"long jumping\" and chain jumping, but overall, Valve did a lovely job!Portal is one of the best games of the year. Its game play is superb and a new invation to gaming.Seriously the greatest FPS experience I\\'ve ever played. plot progression, characterisation, gameplay, technical achievement, feeling of success on completion of tasks and ending.. Superb.Portal is the perfect fusion of Valve\\'s Source engine and the students at Nuclear Monkey\\'s Narbacular Drop. Portal has a great storyline which was a lot better and deeper than I\\'d expected - the added \"Achievements\" and Bonus levels (6 advanced levels and 3 disciplines (least steps, least portals, least time) as challenges in the 6 levels) give enough extra playtime to justify for the short story mode. I really hope Portal will have a successor; luckily, you can hear a few lines in the developer commentary mode talking about the Black Mesa versus Aperture relationship that will be explained more in-depth than in the first release of Portal.\\nPortal has already provided me with lots of fun (and nightmares from the creepy GLaDOS) - I still have some challenges to fulfil and some moves to master, so it\\'s a 10 from me.This game ranks as one of the best to be released this year, with a lot of contenders to compete with.  Granted, Episode 2, Bioshock and several others will still rank higher and hold more appeal and replay, Portal is still probably a greater game because of what it represented and what it does rather than itself alone.  The gameplay mechanics were awesome, but it was short and left you really wanting to take this idea to the next level.  At the moment, it feels like a super demo for the technology of the portal gun.  The cool part about it is that it\\'ll appeal to a larger crowd than the FPS players.  Casual gamers will find it highly appealing, though perhaps not at the individual price it\\'s being offered given that casual gamers will probably not be drawn to Team Fortress 2 or Half-Life 2 or its episodes.Im not sure if many of these people have truly completed the game or not. Once past the initial 16 levels you really need to start thinking in order get through an obsticle. I think it really adds a mental component to a game instead of \"simply shoot everything that walks\"A game that combines first person shooters, puzzles, wormhole physics, cute \\'n happy robots that try to kill you, and cake (be it a lie or not) . . . Truly, there is no comparison. Valve continues to prove that true creativity and innovation still exist. Perhaps humanity -is- worth saving... for use in scientific experiments anywho.An EXCELLENT game, a great combination of action and a Puzzle game. Casual players may have some problems getting by certain levels, especially challenge levels. Besides even if you don\\'t love the game its worth playing just to hear GLaDOS talk. GLaDOS will have you cracking up every level, especially in certaiin levls near the end.its a very short game but fun as hell, very original and funny. it takes a no more than 30 minutes to get into the game, but than its very easy, exept the puzzles thats on a personal level for each, for me they were mostly easy. the game felt very empty, with only 1 living characters and only gladis and here heads talking, it felt just, empty. exept the short gameplay and lack of voices and characters its a must play game, one best 100 of the past 10 years for sure. and being made by valve its easy to understand how it got such succsesGreat game with fantastic ideas, and expert maps for those of us which finished the game after an hour ;).This genius game shows once more that a first-person-shooter like game doesn\\'t have to be bloody at all. The gameplay is a big step towards a futuristic idea and makes players change the way they approach those specific problems. Even though it is the same concept throughout the whole game, it does not get boring at all and the guiding, smart but evilish voice with that bit of irony that accompanies you all the way to the end is yet another great feature. Releasing the game within the Orange Box together with half life 2: episode two was a great idea. All thumbs straight up.I love this game. GLaDOS was hilarious the entire time, and the levels are a great way to think in new ways. Often I knew exactly how to get past something, but it would take seven or more tries to get the execution right, witch only made success more sweet. And to those of you who don\\'t like Portal, go back to your regular, unintelligent shooters, and waste your time on another world war two game. And, Nicholas C., if you really finished the game, you wouldn\\'t get a loading screen, but a video followed by the endsong should make it obvious when the game is truly over.One of the most amazing original and unique games I have ever played, sure i completed it in roughly 3 hours, but it was the greatest 3 hours I have spent playing a game, and it had hints of humour and witiness all the way through, Brilliance.This is probably the most unique and refreshing games I have ever played and brings thought and puzzles as contrast to the intense and fast paced HL2:EP2 along with team fortress this presents a great alternative to the other two when you just need a little break. Totally awesome and completely fun even if it is a little short. (3 hours)What a great game, stylish, funny, and although short none the worse because of it.One of the most innovative and funniest games, ever. When I first played it, I thought it\\'ll be some kind of beta and no real story behind it. That\\'s the idea you got from all the trailers and pics. But it\\'s not true: The game is very entertaining and the idea amazingly cool. I always wanted to shoot my own portals. Prey was a good (third party) start and Portal made it legendary. The few bad things about the game itself, at least the \"campaign\", is that it\\'s very very short. Personally, it took me 3 to 4 hours - and I call myself a good player. After that, you might want to replay it with commentary on - very informative stuff! Challenges, as in beating the levels in an advanced style or time/portal/step-challenges rescues the game. And eventual level-editor and community-support will round it up to a very good 10. Go get it if you didn\\'t, yet!This is the most innovative game I have ever played and I highly enjoy it. The graphics are good, the game play is amazing, and I personally find the narrator to be hilarious.Funniest game I\\'ve ever played.Very fun and yet very unique game. It was only a 3 hour game but had I fun the whole time. After beating the game I wanted more puzzles. The bonus levels helped a bit but I wanted more unique levels. I hope they make a portal 2 and find a way to do some co-op and multiplayer. The ending was the best .Portal is an extremely brilliant game. While I think the learning curve was too gentle, the puzzles began often tricky. I haven\\'t enjoyed a game this much for quite a long time. My only regret is that I already beat it, or at least the main story. There are still 2 additional sets of bonus maps, plus a feature to import maps, which a fantastic mod community will grow around, and the number of puzzles will be enormous!Incredible idea, beautifully crafted, and impeccably executed. I would give it a 9.5 if I could only because of the length of the campaign, however, the pure ability and setup to be expanded by developers and users alike keep this game in the highest ranks in my book.The sick and twisted humor in this game was incredible, and although some of the end puzzles were lacking, I never stopped loving how creative you had to get with the portal gun and how the AI never ceased to make me laugh in a sort of twisted way. The rooms where the previous test subjects had gone also gave it a very eerie feeling, but kept me going all the time.Set in the Half-Life universe, this game is innovative, and highly entertaining, and packed with brain bending puzzles. I only wish it was longer, I beat it in 4 hours. Awesome job!Amazing game, it\\'s full of suprises and it never stops.. and best ever is, if you beat the game.. you can still play with the extra bonus maps included. It has challanges in it, like the least footsteps, least portals, or least time.This game was so great! One of the best I played in a long time. And the credits were just perfect. More games should have such endings. A ground breaking game concept, nice levels, perfect learning curve, hot ending! Just PERFECT.An amazing game that requires you to think in a new and unique way. Add in the ability to reply the maps with even harder difficulty and challenges adds to the replayablilty. Looking forward to the maps the online community is bound to make!I waited eagerly, OK -- *impatiently*, for this game to be released ever since it appeared on my radar after the trailer was released. From the trailer I could tell that this was going to be exactly my kind of fun. This game *exceeded* my expectations in every regard. Although brief, I expect that there will be plenty of puzzles created and exchanged by fans over time as add-ons. I\\'d give away some of my favorite comments to make about this game, but they\\'d be spoilers. But I still have a few good things to add: The voice-acting, and yes apparently this is the voice acting of one certain Ellen McLain and not computer synth, was superbly done. Truly, at the risk of a pun, the icing on the cake. The storyline, although short, makes a wonderful dark little comedy within a science-fiction setting. The end titles, and what was done with it, had me howling with laughter. The gameplay is wonderfully original. As much as I enjoy my FPS-style games, this is a nice change of pace. Yes, there are bullets and rockets fired in the game, but you never get more than the portal gun yourself. You\\'re forced to defend yourself purely with your wits and your agility. Major kudos, gratitude, and wishes for future success to Valve and the team of students-turned-pro who put this game together. It was worth the wait.This is my #1 FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME!  It is really that incredible.  Go out and buy it right now.  The ONLY thing that could possibly make this game any better is if it were a bit longer.  Still, it is totally made of epic win!Short, but sweet.  Great graphics, and nice utilization of th Source engine.\\nThe game is only 3-4 hours long on your first run-through.  Once you get used to it, you can easily finish it in less than an hour, depending on how portal happy you are.\\nValve did a great job of hiring those college students when they found this out.Nicholas c You are very wrong, and the game doesn\\'t deserve a 0 because you ended playing the game halfway through. The game doesn\\'t end there. I understand you came to that \"broken\" chamber after escaping from the chamber 19 as intended, and fell through the elevator and hit the loading screen in air and then the game just ended? That is a weird glitch, never had that one. I reckon starting the game again from chamber 19, it shouldn\\'t take too much to get there again. Even if I had came across this bug, I\\'d still rate it a 10. It\\'s a 20 buck game, having one glitch there doesn\\'t make the game worse IMO. I\\'m still playing the game for fun and don\\'t think it was short at all.The Cake is a lie, but the hype for this game is NOT. The beautiful Source engine is put to major use here as you navigate through a convoluted (and darkly hilarious) maze, the only reward being Delicious Cake and Grief Counseling. GLaDOS is one of my favorite villains, using only psychological manipulation to harm you. This is one of those games that you are going to need your sound on for. The puzzles do seem simple at first glance, but many are much harder then one might imagine, and have many unthought of solutions. By using certain techniques you can prop open doors and even avoid killing companion cube (sadly, I couldn\\'t find a way to take him with me...). Great gameplay, great story, great game.This game is fantastic. The puzzles give you an amazing sense of achievement and the characterisation is the best I have seen in any game recently.This game, though short, was done exceptionally well. It\\'s a great play and an even better laugh. The story, the vocals, and the soundtrack are all magnificently done. 10/10 by me.I Love this game! While in retrospect it does feel kinda short but I did think it was going to end sooner then it actually did so I\\'m glad for that. I really love the 3D puzzles and situations. The humor too is great. This might be my favorite game.I have never before played a puzzle game as fun as this. And when you think the game is about over, it\\'s only about halfway through. It has an amazing plot twist that turns the game completely around. Even the ending is one of best endings I\\'ve ever seen for any game. I will never forget my experience playing Portal.Portal is now one of my favorite games. It starts out slow, but holy crap. This game is EPIC.Most original and FUN game I have played in a log time. It was short, but I loved every element of it. It was creepy yet hilarious at the same time - and the credits - fantastic credits. I know it is only about 2.5 hours to beat the campaign, but I enjoyed it so much I\\'d vote it as GOTY. Bottomline: Great! (especially combined in the Orange Box - great value)This was a great game, fairly easy to solve the main game but then you get to the challenges and the advance stages and it makes everything you have done up to that point as childsplay.This game is a great new concept, the thinking mans/womans First Person Shooter. The way the portals work makes it feel real and is quite fun to fling your self across rooms and go places and do the game your way. The Ending is great tooBest game I have played all year! Great puzzles and awesome plotline. Would love to see some multiplayer mods and more difficult custom maps. This was by far the most brilliant thing to come from anyone in the gaming industry this year. Way to go Valve!Brilliant game. The mood and narration for the last half of the game is just genius. A first person shooter, with firing a single gun or shooting at a single enemy, yet it\\'s still completely awesome. That should tell you something about the quality of this game.Portal will blow your mind. In a good way. A REALLY good way.I really enjoy this game. I find it fun yet not too easy. The solution is obvious once you see it, but the challenge is thinking differently in order to see the solution. I\\'d definitely recommend this game.This is a great game. I have enjoyed all of the puzzles in the game. The main feature I liked was how the portal showed the opposite room of where the other portal was. I heard that in the Developments comontary, they used a method of placing a Camera view facing outside the portal and applying that camera\\'s view on the portal its self. Thats very clever.This game was an absolute blast to play. By far the most original and creative puzzle game I\\'ve ever played. It was also hilarious!Portal harkens back to 80\\'s design in many ways - From it\\'s length (around 3 hours), it\\'s wry humor, to it\\'s ACSII text credits scroll. Most telling, is that there\\'s no magic fairy in your ear, no Big Boss to call into for help. It\\'s you, and you alone, that take the credit for solving your dilemmas. While critics will probably give negative marks for it\\'s length, Portal is unashamed by what is... An exquisite slice of chocolate cake that leaves you slavering for more.Intense, immensely enjoyable, clever, and witty with it. Geat fun!One of the best games to come out in recent times, this game blends humor and cruelty to the highest level as you solve puzzles, while not entirely too difficult, are certainly new, having introduced entirely new gameplay aspects to the \\'first person shooter\\', despite this not being a \\'shooter\\' in the classical sense.I considered this game just a box-filler game for the orange box, boy was I wrong... This is perhaps the best surprise game ive played this year! The term first person puzzler suits this game well, no run of the mill shoot the bad guys, its just you - your portal gun and some great puzzle levels with a twist in the end. Only negative comment ive got for this game now is its length... took me some 3 hrs to run it through and at that point was hyped up for some (much) more puzzles to solve! Anyhows, enought ramble. I a boring x-mas is looming ahead, get the orange box to keep you company. With Portal, this release is perhaps the best entertainment for money this year! We want more!The rating of 88 is far too low. Portal isn\\'t just a puzzle game. The story, despite having no plot is really enjoyable. There are extremely poingent, typically Valve moments. (You took the box away ;) ). This game would be worth buying in it\\'s own right.Pure Genius! Different from anything out there in a while. You definitely start \\'thinking with Portal\\'.This game is exceptional and the only reason why critics are upset about it is because its too short, but with level editors on the way this game will provide more content than ANY of the other parts of the orange box which is saying something, because TF2 is sure to keep giving. All hail valve for knocking it out of the park with this delicious little tidbit.A very unique game with clever dialog and attention to detail that so many games miss. Portal is just fun to play and a riot to experience.One of the most fun games I\\'ve played. Lots of replay value and endless possibilities with mods. Also the best dialogue (or monologue) in any game.A truly refreshing and revitalizing game that takes familiar concepts and creates a fresh new outlook. A puzzler that has numerous solutions, not necessarily \\'open\\' but it leaves much to the imagination. The game rewards those who thinks deep.I got into the game a little later than everyone else, but it seriously is an impressive, fun game. I\\'ve never played 1st person shooter types before (unless you count the first Doom game...) so this was an entirely new game to me. I absolutely recommend the game for everyone. Steam.exe on the other hand is getting a 0 out of 10 for performance and interrupt issues...I am really fascinated by this awesome game and to be honest i never had so much fun with similar puzzle games. The only weakness from this game is the short playtime and the difficulty which is in my reason a little bit too easy.But thats nothing against the fun i had with this game so i think portal is the really treasure of the orange box and should be tried by everyone. And never forget: the cake is a lie.Great game, great mechanics and amazing gameplay. and for the people saying the loading in an elevator thing, its because your computer cannot load the level, its too old or has too little ram. no its not over. the end is when you kill GLADoS . also, please don\\'t give it a 0 due to your frustration. or lack of intelligence to finish it. it shows immaturity. as for valve, they did a great job here, i look forward to more games like it.nicholas c u give it a 0 cuz ur a retarded fag the game is faboulos and it rules i completed it 10 times and i still want more i download the mappack and i completed the ending like 30000 times and it still rules im still completing it its sooo awsome if u want a game a great game at low price like ONLY 14.99  download portal i recomend it oh and nicholas c rated it 1 cuz he had a bad day bottom point    PORTAL IS THE BEST GAME (PORTAL 2 IS COMING ) ok i completed the game and i heard a developerer comentary saying that they WILL make portal 2\\nPORTAL FUCK YEA!This game is by far, the most exciting, inventive, and thrilling games I\\'ve played in years. The graphics and puzzles and \\'hidden areas\\' make me wonder... \\'What exsactly happened to the world?\\'\\nThe Ending was amazing. I played through the last level TWICE, just to hear it again. But the very last sence made me so confident that there will be a Portal 2. WHICH I WILL BUY FOR SURE!. She had hundreds of back up memory shperes. SO COOL. And... it also made me sad... she didn\\'t lie, she really did make me a cake. \\n I loved the game... and I rate games very strictly. The only improvement I could possibley ask for would be... MAKE IT LONGER!\\n  Althought the advanced maps and extra goals filled the void in my heart for a while, a longer game is all I really ask for. THANK YOU VALVE FOR MAKING IT. I really hope you make another.... God bless you Valve... God bless you. =)This game witty, creative, and more intellectually-stimulating than most video games. Honestly, I think I enjoyed this game more than any game I\\'ve played in 10 years.Short, but absolutely consuming.Despite It\\'s short length It is still a fantastic game, in fact what am I doing here i should be doing the challenges. In a game like this graphics have never been a consideration for me over gameplay, but it does look quite stunning. As for gameplay? Well It really is addictive and the shortness of it will be more noticeable due to the fact you wont be able to stop until you are done. I definitely recomend this for anyone old or young, no matter your gaming preference, if nothing else the dialog will bring a smile to your face, especially the closing song.When I saw the ad for this game in Counter-Strike, I just thought, \"Oh great, another bad source-based game.\" However, my friend got me the Orange Box and after installing I played Portal and was instantly captivated. It\\'s a great game for any Physics minded person, and although it goes by pretty quick, the time is extremely enjoyable. Great addition to the Orange Box Valve!I was skeptical that Portal would be as fun and as cool as the trailer (which I watched Lord-knows-how-many times); I tried Narbacular Drop, the technological prequel to Portal, and was wowed by the concept but left with a bad taste in my mouth with the execution. Last night, I completed Portal. I\\'m happy to say, that had to be the best 6 hours of gaming that I\\'ve ever had the pleasure to experience. The puzzles were innovative, thanks to the Portal Gun; the direction of the computer was both disturbing and amusing (if not downright hilarious); and the tie-in to the Half-Life universe is both cool and left me wanting more. I *will* be playing Portal again. Soon. Can\\'t wait for the additional content!It is an excellent and addictive game. Must play.Portal was, in short; short. It taught you how to play the game through a series of levels, and when you were finally trained, the game ended. It was much too easy and lacked much intellect. This game was the preparation of what would be the greatest puzzle video game of all-time (Portal 2). It needed to be the first, so that every flaw in it would be ironed out by the time of Portal 2. Even after all these insults, it was still amazing. It was very funny, had a new and interesting concept behind it, it was quotable, and best of all, memorable.This is a one of a kind, it\\'s a pearl in the mist of mass killing shooter games and other FPS. It\\'s the refreshing breeze in the desert of un-creativity (though short). It\\'s the touch of jokes in a dead laboratory and it\\'s the delicious chocolate that always leaves you starving...\\nBut of course you don\\'t have to like chocolate.This is one of the more innovative games I\\'ve played. The humour and wit make it so entertaining and the puzzles/quests are really interesting. I loved it and can\\'t wait to play the second one. And who can complain about the end song? It\\'s genius!Portal in my opinion is a very original game. It offered something entirely new. It\\'s a puzzle game but it\\'s not just any puzzle game. It has a soul and a charm. The gameplay mainly consists of using a specialised handheld device to create 2 portals, one orange and one blue. Entering one of those instantly causes the player to exit out the other one, and this simple element alone is utilised in a variety of ways to solve a wide range of different puzzles, involving buttons and cubes, turrets, electricity balls and death traps. Additionally to the puzzle solving, the game has a somewhat of an interesting humourous feel to it, ending up with a wide variety of inside jokes that many people still use on the net repeatedly. So far the main drawback for me is that the game is very short, even though it\\'s short and sweet. There are additional challenges that get unlocked once you complete the game, but if you\\'ve enjoyed this and want a full-length game, then I\\'d highly suggest you try Portal 2.Portal is an entertaining adventure with only a few flaws that prevent it from \"near-perfection\". The game doesn\\'t have a very complex detailed plot, but the one and only speaking character in it (GLADOS) makes it one of the best video game stories of all time. Her dark humor is one of the best parts in the game. The puzzles in the game increasingly get difficult as the game progresses (don\\'t worry, the first few puzzles are very easy)  to the point where they are so maddening that you want to throw your keyboard at your computer screen, but the moment you have your \"aha-moment\" and then complete the puzzle and hear an insult from GLADOS, all of the anger you previously had disappears and you feel very accomplished. The graphics are suitable but a tad bit plain for me. Portal can get very buggy and takes a very long time to load, which is probably its biggest flaw. The sound is perfect, as lines from GLADOS are more than enough to keep you satisfied. Gameplay-wise, Portal is very unique, letting your take control of a gun which lets you shoot portals you can traverse through. This leads to very interesting puzzles. Portal is an excellent game, and although you might just want to get Portal 2,  for the full \"Portal\" experience I recommend you get Portal also.This game is funny, this game has a great storyline, the game looks good, overall this game is awesome. i like how this game has its own style. i love this game. i finished it like 3 times, and i still can\\'t get enough of it! It\\'s definitly worth the low price.Incredible game! The concept is great with a huge potential and it\\'s really fun to play!\\nEven after finishing it, I still enjoy to play it again.\\nA must-have.Portal is a perfect example of how it is possible to create great things from simple concepts. Of course you must have at your disposal great resources too, and Portal\\'s again the case: some great graphics, a smooth gameplay, an interesting story which fits perfectly to the playtime. There are games out there that are short. Just deal with it.THE BEST GAME I have played all year. Admittedly it was over all too quickly, I think 8 hours total play time to complete the standard 19 environments, but the game itself is outstanding. Totally original, excellnt atmosphere and feel, and very very involving. I have never played anything quite like it, and on originality alone it deserves 10 out of 10. The game is an \\'environmental puzzle game\\' where you use judgement, skill and \\'portals\\' to pass through the levels. All I can say is buy this game and enjoy the most original game in a VERY long time.Just plain brilliant. Awesome concept. Witty nerd jokes. What a game! I\\'m gonna wish all FPSs had portal devices now.The puzzles are engrossing and will test your logic in that area of the brain you\\'ve never touched before. The game is long enough to unfold some plot, and short enough to stay fresh all the way through. The humor from GLaDOS is spot-on, and darkly hilarious for truly anyone. It\\'s mostly nonviolent. And, one of the best features of the game, the gaping, mysterious plot holes which leave no doubt that Portal and everything with it, such as Aperture Science, GLaDOS, and the player character, Chala, are part of the unfolding Half-Life universe. Even the song at the end (absolute genius lyrics and tune) makes massive suggestions towards the plot. The atmosphere is at the same time lit up and perfectly dark and twisted, and story speculation is the name of the game as you replay a few of the game\\'s phenomenal maps with the difficulty ramped up. Worth the price of admission to the Orange Box all on its own.Great new concept. A welcome relief from numbing shooters.What makes this game rock is the antagonist of this game. The AI with a penchant for cake and killing. The further I ventured through the game the more I wanted to hear what the AI had to say as it suffered more and more from a bipolar disorder. I hope Valve creates more characters like the AI in Portal.With rumors of a sequel in development, it leaves me curious as to where this particular franchise could go.. but now about Portal in particular. Just when I thought games were starting to lack originality and interesting concepts, valve made something that shined brightly above the rest. The graphics.. now feel a little dull, but it was the source engine it was released on, and being the first thing released within the orange box, upon preordering and waiting.. it was a great game and although short, made it re playable. Also to others who think it is to short.. do the bonus levels.. some of them will keep you thinking longer then the actual game does.. and are a great challenge, personally i only could be bothered with six or seven, and about half of the other challenges.. GLaDOS, is a great villain, of which if you do not have sound on during this game.. you will miss out.. and as most of the community unfortuantely knows.. the cake is a lie, and on top of that.. poor companion cube.. forever lost within that flames.. after pointless attempts to exploit a way to save it.. (so many lying youtube videos..) If you have not played it... do so, and if you feel like something different, a group released a portal prequel, as such.. which is literally exactly the same pretty much. Except it is based before GLaDOS was booted up. Warning though, it does have quite a few sexist comments, in parts.. but that does not ruin it really.. since it brings forward a few new challenges, and an interesting different look at the game.Portal has to be one of my top favorite games. Anyone who rates this game less than a 10 is crazy. In my opinion, Portal has the greatest replay value over any other game out there today. Most people will say the game is too short, but trust me, you can make it longer. The game is how long you want it to be. If you choose just to solve the puzzles and not listen to all the things GLaDOS (the voice that talks to you throughout the game)  says, it is true the game will be short. You must listen to the things GLaDOS says to you to enjoy the full experience of the game. This game will run on just about any PC; it has very low system requirements compared to most other games out there today. If you have a high end PC, expect to see over 120 frames per second (I know I do). Also, this game is so stable; I have yet to come across a bug in this game. This game show Valve\\'s great quality and innovation, and I look forward to seeing a sequel (or prequel.)Portal rules! 10 out of 10 for sure! hours of unique game play. Personally I have never seen a game like portal. After the first levels I knew it was awesome. It is relatively simple, not easy, but only if you can figure out that the portals are linked; they don\\'t put you through walls. I made that mistake in the beginning. But then I figured it out, and it was loads of fun. Totally worth it.It might only be two hours, but that worked out very well. No excess, no filler, no fat. The story is interesting, with well-executed foreshadowing and plot buildup. The atmosphere, that being the world that Portal takes place in, the nature of portals, the nature of each puzzle, GlaDOS\\'s voice, and even Chell\\'s leg contraption, all blend smoothly and near flawlessly.i love this game. valve combined puzzles, humor, and an amazing enviroment into a delightful game. i admit, the game is damn short, but the game redeems itself, so for anybody who uses that as an excuse can shut up. i love valve and i cant wait for portal 2.Great game, compelling storyline and puzzles. The engine is near-perfect thanks to constant patching and expert level design. Too bad the game is too short, and the challenge maps are too easy. I can\\'t wait for Portal 2!Pretty much the single best puzzle game I\\'ve played. Even its short length isn\\'t enough for me to give this game anything less than a 10. Anyone who owns a PC needs to get this game. Every once and a while a game comes out that reminds you that real innovation can still happen. This is one of those games.A thrilling and mind bending experiment. Innovative, involved, and exactly what we need to see more of in gaming. Bold steps in new directions. Out of this and portal 2, I still prefer portal 2 by a wide margin. However this game deserves recognition for being truly original at the time of release. And even now really.',\n",
       " 'Best beat em up game ever made. The best game Capcom ever had and it wont get another one like this cause they let go of the best game devs that ever existed. The game is pure fun with solid soild gameplay.What a fantastic game.  Here\\'s a quick run down of what\\'s so great.  100% customizable move set.  Great dodging system where you get up close and must deal with individual attacks, then get back on the offensive.  All animations can be cancelled, making the combat smooth - cancel when you miss, cancel when you hit and want to interrupt your own attack with another - and cancel when you are hit yourself, so you get back to your ready stance.  Brilliant!  Dynamic difficulty - the better you are, the harder the game gets, and if you are struggling, it gets a bit easier.  That way, everybody is challenged by this game, it just gets harder and harder!  Great variety of enemies and enemy attacks - all fair, with wind up animations and audio cues, so it\\'s always fair.  Beat the game, and unlock all moves in the shop for your game+ as well as some totally new ones for your 2nd play through.  Also bonus costumes, and 50 unique challenges to beat.  Great comedy and enemy design, funny dialogue, lots of game references, and really catchy music.  Pretty much the best game on the PS2, and still stands up today.  Get it!This game is so fun you won\\'t even notice the lack of a jump button. In an ocean of beat-em-ups where even the best games tend to blend together, this is a truly unique game with a style all its own. The action is tight, the character design is fresh, and the over-the-top-ness hits all the perfect notes. There is no greater feeling than stomping an enemy\\'s face into the ground two dozen times in five seconds.\\n\\nThis game doesn\\'t try to be anything other than fun. And it succeeds in just about every way. Even for 2018.i can\\'t believe the critics opinion on this game  it is one of the most underrated games of all time  a true master piece  it is funny  gameplay smooth and addictive  story not that good  but the game play is just the bomb of this game  it is one of my favorite games of all timeone of the greatest video games of all time,perfect combat system,customizable move set,boss fights\\n\\nthe reason i purchase a second  ps2 after my first one brokeI can\\'t believe the idiots at IGN think that God Hand is terrible. First off, the game is not terrible. And second, I think it really has a great elemental styles of comedy references from Chappelle\\'s Show to an homage to Shinji Mikami\\'s Devil May Cry. I played the game on the Playstation 2 Classics on PSN and I haven\\'t stop playing for hours when every boss battle shows up. It was really an honor for Clover Studio (now Platinum Games, home of Bayonetta) to make an over-the-top fighting-like action game that wants you to test your fists and strength also break out some finishing nanuevers like the God Stomp and all those types. I thought Okami was better than God Hand, I was wrong. But they both share some great moments, though. I think Capcom did what they did and it\\'s one of the best underrated games that doesn\\'t suck.Played on PlayStation 2.\\nGameplay: GREAT.\\nStory: GOOD.\\nGraphic: GREAT.\\nMusic/Sound: GOOD.\\nDialogue: GOOD.Third -person fighting game that goes crazy at times making it an experience.Without a doubt, a game that must be proven since only the characters design is worth the game.Cover I know your company is dead But where ever you are Please pick this game and continue it .\\n**** copcom for destroying , Destroying this artful game .\\nNObody KNEW ABOUT THIS GAME AND HOW FUN IT WAS .\\nHoping for a continuation.Fantastic game, critical assessment is a joke, I must have played this game about 50 times without sickness, because the game provides this possibility, like the amazing variety of blows, but there is an evaluator that cannot pass the first phase andPut the blame in the game, unfortunate.One of the bessssst game on ps2 you can play!!!!!\\nTrust me just insert disk and enjoy the journeyEasily the best beat em up game ever, a game that deserves a remake without the PS2 hardware limitations.The best fighting gameplay, very satisfying, iconic and beautiful soundtrack, I really like funny things in this game, and I didn\\'t find it in other games until now 2021, GOOD GAME - SLAP ASS!!Even though this game has some flaws but still it has its uniqueness    .This game is never meant to be taken seriously.

If you like a challenging game, must check this one out.Fantastic gameplay, one of my favourites of all time!! This rocks! Good difficulty, love the character design, story and music.best game in my life and yes bro i love Asian video games and godhand is very special for me {:As far as brawlers go, this takes the cake, possibly forever. TOO over the top you say! It\\'s a video game. There\\'s no such thing as TOO over the top. You want to kick a demon in the groin, go ahead. Maybe you would like to barrel kick a group of thugs, no one\\'s stopping you. This game sets the bar for brawlers. I am glad some game developers realize games are supposed to be fun. Pick this gem up before it\\'s gone forever.This game\\'s a gem. It\\'s nothing too deep, no pretentions; God Hand is just a fun, challenging game about brawling. If you can dig that, then you\\'ll love it.It is a damn shame this game flopped (thank you ign).\\n\\nPositives\\n\\n1. It\\'s difficult while being fair. Unlike games such as I Wanna Be The Guy or... other indie games, when you die in this game, it\\'s on you, not shoddy programming.\\n\\n2. It\\'s amazingly over-the-top. Like some weird mix of Fist of the North Star, Western movies, and Streets of Rage, the game knows how to make you say \"What\".\\n\\n3. It\\'s funny in a medium where most attempts to be funny fall on their faces. It\\'s not afraid to be politically incorrect, not afraid to sound goofy, and not afraid to offend.\\n\\nNegatives\\n\\n1. Though some would say the casino adds \"color\" and \"flavor\" to the game, I think it\\'s just a waste of time.\\n\\n2. Uh... you can see through textures?\\n\\nI don\\'t have much negative to say about God Hand. 9 out of 10. You should buy it as a reminder of when Capcom didn\\'t suck.This game is hilariously underrated, and anyone turned off by negative reviews should give it a second thought. Initially, you may be turned off by the fact that the game essentially throws you right into the middle of things, with no idea of what to do, but tinker around with it, and you\\'ll find a rewarding combo system, with clever (albeit irreverant) humor and dialog. Plus the soundtrack is great.This is probably the most fun I\\'ve had playin a beat em up since streets of rage. It captures all the fun of the early 90\\'s games with over the top moves and other moves that will just make you laugh. There are some elements to the game that are frustrating, for example when you go through three quarters of the level only to be defeated then have to redo the whole thing. It can turn into some button bashing, but you still have to think about it the majority of the time. The game doesn\\'t warrant 9 or 10 in my eyes, which are left to games which are near perfect rather than a tongue-in-cheek effort to re-create whats missing from so many beat-em-ups. Overall i feel its a truly rewarding game, just challenging enough, but not too hard and if you don\\'t take your gaming too seriously this is a fun and addictive game.The graphics aren\\'t good, but God Hand more than makes up for it by being a really funny and challenging game. It\\'s awesome!Not be it for you to take any sort of guidance off someone who thinks Chaos Legion was an amazing slash \\'em up and completed Megaman X7 on his own volition but this game comes under my top 10 favourite games of all time. It\\'s not because of the frustrating and constant dying which just ends up being funny after the twelfth time the same fat ninja does the spinney blade thing at you just after you\\'ve got out of one fight with three guys. It\\'s not because of the humour that makes the game it\\'s only little laughing stoke, drenched in liquid awesome. It\\'s because of the places you can go after you beat it the first time. If you\\'re anything like me then you aren\\'t happy with the total annihilation of medium difficulty and beating Easy makes you feel like a weakling, even though you\\'re destined to die at least once a level on easy. No, if you\\'re anything like me you will complete easy and medium, put the controller down and then pick it up again after a few seconds because you just want to SEE if you can get through hard mode. Then you think that it\\'d be a good idea to try a kick-me sign run, a run through the game that stops you from using your special abilities. The game could last you months and months and could even totally destroy your social life if you wanted try a hard mode kick me sign run which can only be described as \"mental\".God Hand is a fantastic game. The fact that you can fully customise your combos and movelist means that you can change the game to match YOUR fighting style more than ever before. This is a good thing because the game is challenging, and unlike some games where button mashing may get you somewhere, button mashing in God Hand won\\'t even get you past the first few enemies. It requires real skill, and when you become one with the fighting engine and start dominating with combos that you created yourself it\\'s incredibly satisfying. The characters and dialogue are so funny I was in stitches for most of the game. There are heaps of other great ideas in this game, for example instead of only getting upgrade points through fighting, you can take them to a casino and try to increase the amount. 300 points short of a new upgrade? Go to the Blackjack table and get that upgrade sooner rather than later! You can even bet on Chihuahua Races, which is so much fun it could be a game on it\\'s own. The graphics aren\\'t high quality (great art style though) but the sound definitely is! I\\'m totally addicted to this game, I got it for 24 Aussie dollars and it\\'s paid for itself ten times over already! I think Edge put it best when they said you will either love it or hate it, but either way you have to play it at least once. So go play it!God Hand might be the most underrated game of its time. The game is just pure fun, from the goofy dialogue and voice acting to the surpisingly in-depth combat system, God Hand is the polar opposite of games that take themselves seriously. Chris Roper\\'s review and score of the game lack any accuracy and should not dissuade you from giving it a try. For such a difficult game that\\'s primarily about punching people, God Hand is likely to charm the daylights out of you.The best beat-em-up/action EVER. God Hand is hilariously underrated. I don\\'t know why. It\\'s FUN FUN FUN and challenging. Really, the game is unique.. The fact that you can TOTALLY customise moves means that you can change the fighting style to match YOUR personal warrior more than ever before.With punches like these your enemies won\\'t recall what century it is, or even remember the fond taste of butter. Knocking blocks off has never been so fab. The unique combat system forces you to press the attack and get gud! The ability to change your button inputs is a refreshing change in the genre and allows for a fully customizable move set that must be adjusted based on some encounters. Unfortunately, this also leads to a lack of variety as many moves remain benched. When not feeling like an absolute shonen anime badass you are left to question if you can abide the absurdist humor steeped in misogyny and sexism that both feels like it was written by a 13 year old (no offense tween) and does not hold up in 2021.Masterpiece one of the best games I have ever played fun enjoyable and memorableBrutal and funny game for me. The graphic isn\\'t  too good but  the game is. It has some funny moves like ball buster and something like that  and im very proud that I finish the game in hard mode.God Hand is criminally underrated -- quite frankly I\\'m embarrassed for Roper\\'s now infamous 3/10 score. The game not only captures the fun of classic beat \\'em ups (as noted by James here), but it surpasses it. Like one of Capcom\\'s earlier titles, Resident Evil 4 (yes I know God Hand was technically developed by Clover; put a sock in it), the camera is fixed behind the character\\'s back. Also like Resident Evil 4, the game features an unorthodox control scheme; it\\'s frustrating to get the hang of but incredibly rewarding once mastered. And master it you must, even if you play it on easy mode. Beware, folks: God Hand ain\\'t for sissies. The difficulty level is completely dynamic; on normal mode, it fluctuates between 1, 2, 3, and DIE (1 for suckers; DIE for masters). If you take a beating, the enemy level drops; if you dish one out, the enemy level rises. In its difficulty, its over-the-top moves, its humor, and awesomely bad dialog, God Hand is like gaming of yore. If you\\'re searching for a slow, plodding game riddled with unskippable cutscenes, avoid this game at all costs. If you don\\'t think games are Serious Business and want something fun and challenging, pick up God Hand.Terrific game so far. I picked it up and played it for about 5 hours straight! Haven\\'t done that in awhile. Great fighting and very weird and hilarious!God of War, Street Fighter, Devil May Cry.... all in one. With this said, let me go into details, in this game you will probably be doing alot more button mashing than formulating combos, but combos can be achieved. It is more hand-to-hand combat with the ability to pick up weapons and wail on opponents. It is very fast paced action and all moves can be initiated very quickly, such as dodging, which you should do alot. The entire right thumbstick is dedicated to dodging styles. One thing this game has over the other three games I named is the camera. This game puts you right there with the action, Resident Evil 4 closeness. I love everything about this game and am prepared to give it a 10, but giving credit to awesome stories put into other games, I have to let this one fall -1 for a lack thereof.Sure, there\\'s not a lot of polish here. It doesn\\'t matter; you\\'ll be too busy enjoying beating the ever-loving crap out of everything in sight. Easily one of the most pure fun games on PS2. Well worth the 20 bucks it\\'ll run you--in fact, it\\'s a better 20 dollar game than God of War or Kingdom Hearts 2.I spent 18 hours playing this game on hard mode, and I am impressed. It\\'s sad that companies are actively staying away from making hard games, like Battle Toads. This game is great and the best game I played since RE4. Pick it up.One of the finest and funniest scrolling beat-em-ups ever, frankly. Any game with the line \"I\\'m Alexander the Great!\" deserves a gold star.God Hand is the best brawler on the PS2. I don\\'t understand how this game can get critised about the camera when God of War gets 100% and you can\\'t even see where you are going! Again God of War get\\'s points for a good fighting system when in thruth it is not even customisable. You have maybe 30-50 moves in GOW where as in God Hand you have more like 100 moves that you can set into a combo of your choosing. I really don\\'t see why people praise such a mediocore game as GOW and don\\'t see the genious in such a awesome game as God Hand.God Hand is old school hard straight from the beginning. If you are persistent and never give up, you will be rewarded with one of the most amazing brawling experiences ever released on any system. This game is not just a mindless button mash either, so don\\'t expect to win just by smashing the same button over and over through the game like so many other brawlers, your quick reflexes and masterful use of the stunning array of moves available to you will be rewarded with a genuinely FUN and hilarious over the top action experience. Where else can you boot demons in the groin then kick them into outer space?This game is so much fun, its funny and awesome at the same time. I loved the fact that you are able to create combos and the roulette system is fun as f**k. One for the ages this game, often overlooked but always awesomeAwesome game. I love it enough to edit the review score. DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRface paced action game with **** camera and auto lockon working against you all the **** time.  **** user scores, this is a **** gameanother one, and another one, and another one.... The PS2 just has so many bangers its hard to stop going back to this great console, this game is absolutely a must play despite its biggest flaw which is being so repetitive but the combat is really nice, the custom strings you can do with your moves you can do your own style of combos and play how you like, just don\\'t google which is the best combo chain there is in this game because where is the fun in that? experiment for yourself what this game has to offer you. The bosses in this game are hilarious, some can be cheap and dumb and salt inducing but its a really nice game. Totally recommend it.Fantastic game with hard-to-master control scheme, which put some early reviewers off.\\n\\nBut make no mistake, there\\'s a lot to love here. It took me a while to learn to enjoy this game, but once you learn the mechanics, and become good at it, it starts to play like a dream.\\n\\nThe fighting mechanic is unique, the levels are well-paced, the three difficulty levels are well-balanced,  the enemies are a good match, the bosses are interesting, the comedy is quirky,\\n\\nThe most important thing is that it presents a beautifully-playing third person action adventure game. It stands up there with Devil May Cry and God of War as one of the very best in the genre, while simultaneously standing out for its unique, groundbreaking blend of styles. We need a sequel badly.Capcom have great games in PS2, especially godhand, this games is very cool fighting ever after dmc. Graphics is good, gameplay is brutal but still cool action, and all about fun just fun...and again if you have guts, then play this games until you can defeated this final boss with 2 god hand...have fun.[OVERVIEW=10]\\nOne of the greatest 3D beat-em-ups ever made. Smooth, fast, and pure.\\n\\n[PRESENTATION=9]\\n(Visuals=7) Anime-physics-influenced with rapidfire punching and characters launching across the room. Characters look…don’t know if “good” is the right word; let’s say, interesting; “Fist of the North Star”-ish, as if they’re all trying to start fights for dressing funny, which would fit the plot. Colorful environments, wonderful fighting animations.\\n(Sound=7)\\n(Physics=6) Screen shakes add to the impacts, much as in “RAD:Robot Alchemic Drive.” Doors/crates/chairs shatter, but no ragdolling. One section of one level has cloth physics curtains\\n(Plot=9) It has that bizarre auteur-style plot in service to the chaotic setting and gameplay rather than coherence or believability. It certainly kept my attention, and I never used its skip feature.\\n\\n[CONTROLS/MECHANICS=10]\\n(100% Melee Brawler/Beat’EmUp=10)\\nYou have Triangle and X attacks, a 6-hit sequence by repeatedly pressing square, and 3 more strikes by holding the L-stick back when pressing buttons. Movement is “tank” style (turning instead of strafing); double-tapping L-stick forward runs (FAST), enabling rushing attacks.\\nAttacks follow the convention of speed being inversely proportional to power. Slower strikes can have effects that stagger, knock back, sweep surrounding enemies, launch into the air, or break through enemy blocking.\\nYou can pick up and use/throw objects/weapons, but you can’t throw enemies. Circle will pummel downed/staggered enemies. There are almost no QTE’s aside from waggling the L-stick to escape grabs.\\nThe dodging mechanic with the R stick is superb: press forward in perfect timing to duck, allowing a free hit, backwards or sideways to dash more safely.\\nPlay speed is extremely fast, so managing crowds requires excellent reflexes. The “feel” is just unparalleled, and while the game can get very hard (on “Easy”!), you are always in complete control.\\nSpecial attacks and a Rage mode let you briefly but enjoyably decimate enemies every so often.\\n(Physics=7) Enemies can accidentally hit each other, i.e., with rushing attacks, and you can knock enemies into each other.\\n(Camera=5) A behind-the-back view focuses on the enemies in front, but you’re vulnerable to being blindsided from behind.\\n(Friendly AI=6) If you rescue (and somehow avoid beating up) friendlies, they reward you with health/upgrades.\\n(Enemy AI=9) Enemies are great at ganging up on you, hitting you while you’re mid-stomping a downed enemy or running to grab thrown objects, which encourages you to watch the upper-right-corner radar and keep dodging. Enemies have great variety and occasionally do 2-person combos; bosses are particularly interesting.\\n\\n[DESIGN=9]\\n(Menus=6)\\n(Level Design=7) Levels are nice and constrained, but there are a few interesting additions here and there to the “beat everyone up” objective, like stomping out a bomb’s fuse while fighting off enemies. There are some environmental hazards to knock enemies into (like chairs, a collapsing veranda, fire, or kicking them off rope bridges), but nothing on the order of, say, Madworld.\\n(Difficulty Curve=0) “Normal” is just unreasonably, frustratingly hard, at least on a first playthrough. “Easy” is still hard, because difficulty goes up in realtime the better you do, killing you faster than (I) can improve. Enemies and crates drop health, but strangely you get no free health between levels. Checkpoints keep things do-able, but it badly needs quicksaving/quickloading, ideally mapped to the controller.\\n(Upgrade System=9) You collect and swap out moves. At first I felt it was a needlessly complicated keybinding feature, but once you unlock more, there’s a lot of fun to be had tailoring and experimenting with different movesets. I put a fast fist combo on the square-sequence and different special properties on the remainder. It’s a mark of excellent design that there’s no way to rearrange moves to “cheapen” things: fast attacks eventually get blocked, causing you to stagger; slower moves get interrupted. You have to react fast enough to break guard or dodge as appropriate.\\n(Modes=Singleplayer campaign (15 hours. 50% Padding)) The campaign stays interesting the entire playthrough, but I feel it’s “padded” because the difficulty makes you replay everything at least twice as often as is ideal. There’s also optional timed challenges in the levels and an “arena” mode.\\n\\n[CONCLUSION]\\nIt reminds me of Wii “Madworld” but way better. A “10” engages me to the point of obsession with unique gameplay that has never been surpassed by sequels, and while God Hand meets both criteria easily, I was still hesitant because of the frustrating difficulty. But it challenges God of War, Metal Gear:Revengeance, Ninja GaidenZ:Yaiba, and X-men Origins:Wolverine for the title of best singleplayer 3d beat-em-up on any system. While its creators went on to form Platinum games, a studio known for 3D beatemups, no Platinum game ever came close in quality.Just started playing and all i can say is that it still is extremely hard getting used to even after a few days. Im assuming it takes quite a bit to get the timing down of the various dodges but after that i bet its gonna be way more awesome than to play it already is. The graphics arent even that bad compared to games now a days, so it\\'s not an issue at all when you play, the soundtrack is very goofy but it fits in very well, and the storyline seems cool so far. Don\\'t expect a hardcore fighting game from God Hand, expect a laid-back purely for fun beat em up game to pass time on every now and then :Dbest game of ps2\\nit\\'s so sad that many people do not even know this game exists...Underrated epic game that is one of the most fun I have ever played. This game had a lot of bad reviews because of  bad camera and the fact that it is very hard, but if you give it a try, you are going to find a really well made and fun combat mechanics that give you the chance to create your own fighting style.God Hand stands out from most games of this genre by having many unique elements you find in games today. To dodge you don\\'t simply roll out of the way but have to dodge vertical, horizontal,  high, mid and low attacks with three different dodge actions. You can customize your moves for many different play styles giving more replay along with ng+. Difficulty changes depending on how well you do at the game but there is still easy mode if you don\\'t want that kind of challenge just yet. The games humor appealed to me but may not be for everyone but new players may come to enjoy it. This game also has a variety of bosses so you will always have something to look forward to. The music is great so you won\\'t get bored of the same track anytime soon but this won\\'t matter either since there is a good variety here.\\n\\nThe only bad things i can say about this game is the obvious quality in graphics and the lack of a boss rush mode. Some may find the controls weird and the lack of a hard lock on very distracting but this can be fixed by your self if you know what to do. But a hard lock could have been applied by relocating the taunt or God Hand mode.\\n\\nThis is the kind of game that set the standard for brawlers in the future but sadly we don\\'t see so do try this kind of game once.This  game is Perfect, graphics, history, SOUNDTRACK, GAMEPLAY.\\n\\nVer very underratedThe 3D action game has the player moving in all directions, attacking with the face buttons and using special moves. The player can turn around using a button, and all actions outside of basic attacks are performed via a context sensitive button.[5] Using the button allows the player, as Gene, to jump up ladders, pick up items, and use special attacks on abnormal enemies. Four dodge moves are mapped to the directions on the right analog stick. The player can assign any attacks, including the Circle, Triangle, Square and X buttons. Square allows the player to chain multiple attacks at once.[5] There are over one hundred moves in the game for the player to choose from including basic jabs and punches to drunken-style and capoeira martial arts.If you\\'re a thoughtful person, you may have realized that some of the best games are the ones who take the biggest risks. Even if it takes 20 years for players to come around, the ones that go down in the books are the ones everybody hated, or glossed over, at first. God Hand is one of them. If you\\'re on the fence about trying this title out, try to avoid the reviews. This title could be your favorite game ever - it stands out, it takes a lot of risks, does things very differently from the rest. If you don\\'t like unique or original media, you won\\'t like God Hand. This game gets bad reviews by gamers who don\\'t like experiences outside their comfort zones, that\\'s all that is. The type of person who says \"This game cheats!\" when they lose, and lean towards games that hold player\\'s hands through the 60 seconds of gameplay in-between cutscenes. Like it or not, there\\'s a schism in gaming; there are people who like \"experiences\", and people who like games that challenge them to grow and overcome their weaknesses. God Hand isn\\'t the former type of gaming experience, and it doesn\\'t deserve to be rated poorly by gamers who don\\'t like spicy food.\\n\\nHow can you go wrong with the same team that brought Okami, and Viewtiful Joe?13 years has passed.Still constantly checking for updates regarding god-hand 2.God-hand is one of the greatest gameplay,I have ever played.Cult game. Great gameplay and so funny. The reviews who gave it a bad mark totally missed the point. Come on IGN, time to re-review!About as good as it gets. Violent, challenging and filled to the brim with quirky humor. God Hand is God\\'s gift to fans of character action, tight game play, extreme customization and adaptability. And by God, I\\'m of course referring to none other than Shinji Mikami himself.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t act like you don\\'t like the Ball Buster!Best beat em up game ever made. The best game Capcom ever had and it wont get another one like this cause they let go of the best game devs that ever existed. The game is pure fun with solid soild gameplay.One of the greatest games ever made, this is the best example that story doesn\\'t matter in a game when it\\'s gameplay is extremely enjoyable with high reply value.never played it before.just came to know that this game has a cult following and its very challenging and i love challenges .what a good game.even in 2018 almost 12 years after its release . its still awesome even though graphics are dated. those prefer challenging games like souls , Bloodborne just go for it.\\nReally a Classssic!!!!!!!! on PS2I think It\\'s humanly impossible to not like this gem. This is probably one of the greatest games ever made and **** those **** of IGN for giving this game a Three out of TenIt seems to me is one of the jewels of the PS2, pity that very few people know him since he deserved much more attention.Also again Shinji Mikami demonstrating because he is a genius ...his game is so fun you won\\'t even notice the lack of a jump button. In an ocean of beat-em-ups where even the best games tend to blend together, this is a truly unique game with a style all its own. The action is tight, the character design is fresh, and the over-the-top-ness hits all the perfect notes. There is no greater feeling than stomping an enemy\\'s face into the ground two dozen times in five seconds.\\n\\nThis game doesn\\'t try to be anything other than fun. And it succeeds in just about every way. Even for 2018.Outside the camera, everything else is solid mechanics with a simple story but that serves to take you through the different scenarios available.I zero to damn ... more than 30 times at hard, I recommend ... one of the best games in history.… ExpandMy first hardest game. I love to make new moveset combos and make experiments of it.a must play game, this is the best game for laugh hard and to play when you are home aloneEven though it has a high difficulty even though it is nonormal the game itself is a good game has a good story etc ... But I missed a more pleasant gameplay and the characters are without charisma the boss are insane of difficult has certain parts of the game thatThey were made for difficult sere the attacks are cool but the game becomes tiring and nauseating after a while but for you who likes a game with extreme difficulty even being normal this game is right game for you!One of the best of its kind, unique combat style, funny story, tasty and satisfying gameplay, challenging and rewarding, I find myself playing again and again.Game popular PS2 fight game nice fight game nice game songs good dialogue and nice combo.this game is the best game beat em up ever made thank you mr mikami\\nand I wish this game has port in ps4one of the overlooked gems of its time, this game wasn\\'t made for critics and media but for players who enjoy it i guess, its one of those pieces that you wish to see remastered with the advanced technology of this day and age.The most satisfying gameplay in a videogame ever. Needs a remake or pc portProbably one of my most favorite games of all time, next to F-Zero GX.\\nFirstly some cons with the game, getting used to the unique third person perspective is a bit of a challenge but you eventually get used to it, plus the radar is of great help to determine where enemies are. Sometimes the auto-lock is not helpful and may lock onto the wrong enemy - this is probably the biggest flaw with the game IMO but it\\'s not a constant nagging issue.\\n\\nNow for the pros, there\\'s a lot. Customizable moveset with over 100 different moves, incredibly skillful combat against enemies, lots of great music, and very funny cutscenes.\\nA lot of the attacks are upgrades of another, but there\\'s still lots of unique animations and properties that really shake up gameplay. You can set up different combos very easily and it\\'s very cool. A tip, a combo comprised of attacks with your left fist (including left jab among others) will attack faster than if you have attacks which alternate between other fists. If you don\\'t know what I mean, try it! You\\'ll understand quickly. Launch moves can launch enemies farther away, Juggle can bring enemies up into the air so you can set up an Air Launch Kick move, you can Trip enemies and do an Axe Kick to also do an Air Launch Kick, etc. You have a couple moves that are on you by default (Sidesweep, Shoryuken, Air Launch Kick, Axe Kick and the knee thing that accompanies it after using it) - these are always available and are very useful throughout the entirety of the game. Don\\'t waste a slot for the bindable Sidesweep attack, just use the one you are equipped with.\\n\\nCombat has a lot of depth that isn\\'t very easy to catch on at first. I can\\'t explain it properly, but enemies when attack leave openings that allow you to deal extra damage to them (makes a sound cue) or leaves them open to certain move properties like Launch or Juggle. This is VITAL to dealing with multiple enemies as you can Launch one guy away and deal with other enemies, or juggle them then launch multiple enemies together. There\\'s a lot of depth and options here and that\\'s just one example.\\n\\nMusic is from the same composer as Danganronpa. It\\'s awesome and is one of my favorite soundtracks.\\nThe cutscenes use some crude humor in them and man is it funny. Elvis is probably my favorite character and I always enjoy watching these cutscenes, even after playing through it multiple times. They\\'re great fun. I\\'d recommend watching a few on YouTube but then you\\'re spoiling the fun of witnessing them unexpectedly.\\nThe dodge mechanic is a very interesting mechanic. You can sidestep, backflip, and \"up-dodge\" - which means you can dodge in-place without moving. Up-dodging at times can be a bit risky but it\\'s usually preferred since enemies don\\'t attack your lower body too often. It also fills up your difficulty meter (the game has an adaptive difficulty! Getting hit by enemies means a lower difficulty but avoiding getting hit increases it). Side-stepping and backflipping is usually reserved for certain attacks that demand it, such as when an enemy is charging after you. You usually have to get used to the enemy attacks to determine when it\\'s appropriate to side-step or backflip.\\n\\nOverall I love this game. There\\'s a few minor flaws but that doesn\\'t get in the way of it. I love game that involve the player needing to learn and understand the game to really get good and enjoy it. F-Zero X and GX are like it, and so is God Hand. It\\'s not a game for everyone for sure, but it\\'s stellar regardless. I can\\'t recommend it enough.This is a must play game on ps2, i loved every single level of this game, heavily customizable and awesome. Hope this game gets a remaster or remake on ps5This game is amazing, one of my favorites without a doubt, has a very entertaining and varied gameplay, since you can change the combos that the character performs (there are a large number of variables).The game presents a fairly entertaining comedy and a good variety of bosses to defeat, which have their own personality and somewhat extravagant designs.Masterpiece, highly recommendedLiterally the best beat\\'em up game if not the best game i\\'ve ever played in my life ... i\\'ts really shame how such a masterpiece like this is soo underrated and overlooked   Everything from the combat system , Roulette System Techniques , and espically the characters designMaybe the story isn\\'t that well done or was fast written but it doesn\\'t matter for me the game IsIt was a great game, a game with great gameplay and amazing characters,I wish they were remaking this gameExcellent very funny game and I want to play again as well as Evil 4 resident game is very addictive and charismatic this game I hopeThere will be nothing ever again like this game. I played it 4 times and always had a blast with the totall unique and glorious combatsystem. The thing is: You move around with tank controlls. The left stick is for walking and the right stick is for doding. Never seen anything like this. I could go on how the systwm works but I\\'m sure someone has already done it better , . Solt me just tell you this game is a hit or miss. You either love this game , or dont get it. Would recommend to jusg tried it (even though the orices are rising now).One of the best Beat em up games I\\'ve ever played. It sucks that we might never see a sequel in the near futureThis is possibly the best 3D Beat\\'em up ever. Funny, hilarious, a parody of \"Fist of the North Star\", God Hand knows how to laugh at itself and the narrative story remains in the background. The important thing is neither in its graphics nor in its empty scenarios. The strong point is in the frenetic, intense and fluid gameplay that so characterizes the titles of \"Platinum Games\" even if this was the last title of \"Clover Studios\".\\n\\nWhat usually happens is that many people in their first contact with the game usually do not connect with the game, but once you give it a chance and begin to understand its mechanics and you adapt even though the camera is a little uncomfortable you enjoy a game in which the author\\'s vision is noted and that dares to experiment and get out of the established archetypes in the genre.\\n\\nAnother added bonus is the freedom of the player to create your own combos by assigning a combat technique to a certain button, plus it is reminiscent of \"Kung-Fu\" and \"Wild West\" movies. A work that in its day had mixed scores from the press, but today has earned its cult game status with all the merit it deserves. A PS2 exclusive classic that deserves more recognition.most game ever gameplay / legend story / there is no story play while you are silent graphics / ps2 what do you expectfun/ very fun and replayable… ExpandThe best fighting game I\\'ve ever played, years ahead of it\\'s time, the smoothness, fluidity of combat, the animation and the humor all are just brilliant.\\n\\nShame on IGN for killing this game, nothing good as this has yet to be released.',\n",
       " 'an atmospheric and revolutionary game that surpasses every other game within the survival horror genre ti\\'ll this day.\\nMy only complaint about RE4 is the lack of a quick select for weapons and items.(instead of pausing for the inventory)\\nbut it\\'s all because of the gamecube controller\\'s limitations.\\nsoOne of the greatest games ever created. I was not a fan of the Resident Evil series until this game. I was blown away on every level imaginable. Nothing short of a stroke of genius.this is one of the few games that surpased the hype it had . i knew it was gona be great but wow not this damn great . this game was the only reason i bought a Gamecube and it was money well spent. the controls are solid and no more bad camera angles as it switches to the 3rd person mode . a great gun slection with upgradable guns . the action is top notch i mean i was grining ear to ear playing this game . i must have beatin this game around 100x since the day it came out and i will still pop it in from time to time and play it again. the boss fights simply put are EPIC and some of the best in gaming history . the only down side to this game is story wise its abit holey i felt some things like krouser and his past with leon where not explained well at all and the puzzle set up was way way easy it took no brains to figure them out. still though the thrill ride this game provides is second to none.Here\\'s my Top 50 games of all time:The Legend of Zelda a Link to the PastSuper MetroidThe Legend of ZeldaMetroid Prime (Trilogy)Banjo-KazooieResident Evil 4Tetris DSWords with Friends (Scrabble)Super Mario GalaxyMike TysonâDon\\'t understand what the hype is about. Same controls, but with worse graphics. RE remake and RE 2 are my favs. RE4 is frustrating, and hardly revolutionary, especially with the same fighting techniques as before. Mini-games are good, and the individual aiming is nice - but you can\\'t blow off any other part of the Ganados except their head! OVERATED GAME! Change the control style and bring back zombies and you\\'ll have a winner.Best resident evil I\\'ve played. Action, suspense and thrilling scares and excitement all the way. Gritty and immersive, even the OTT bosses fights fit this amazingly atmospheric world that Capcom have built. Play this.A  Masterpiece in gaming , Capcom I salute you for this amazing game.I have never been through a 1 player game so many times , Would love something  like this to turn up again with a new look, story and multiplayer online.but nevermind i can safely say this hasn\\'t been beaten yet in my honest opinnion:) Bar zelda ofcourse ,ocarina of time :) 10/10Great graphics and story, but way to easy. What happend to hard games that took a long time to beat? This took me only 20 hours. Almost simplistic puzzles that don\\'t really make the game feel like it should even be in the RE series. Cool game, but best game ever? not even close.Fun action, gameplay feels somewhat restricted, story is lame duck, not sure what some people are smoking.This game is a masterpiece, not as good as re 2, but still the atmosphere and the gameplay is amazing, and it\\'s still fun to play nowadays, and the community that this game created is great, funny people and great speedrunners, some other glitch and secrets to be discovered, and you have ione of the most memorable and cool games ever made, almost any gamer can enjoy this masterpiece, give it a try if you haven\\'t. The music is beautiful and the plot is one of the best written out there.\\nThere are many versions of this game, so play the best one you can, this is worth playing.\\n\\n8/10In my opinion Resident Evil 4 is the best survival horror game and the best out of the RE series followed closely by Resident Evil Remake. The great story and the outstanding character/enemy design just flashed me back then. I guess it\\'s needless to say that RE 4 is one of my favorite games of all time. The GC version was the first one I played (obviously). Today I own 4 versions of this game (GC, Wii, Xbox 360 and Ultimate HD for PC).When it was first released on GameCube I was immediately hooked! Its been the only game I still have fun beating over and over again till this day! Beaten on GameCube, Wii, PS 2 and PC. One of Capcom\\'s greatest games!Perhaps it\\'s the fact that I got round to buying it late, maybe by the time I played it most of it\\'s innovations had been stolen by other games, but i\\'m just not into it. The graphics while nice are incredibly dull, It showed me shades of grey i never even knew existed. It\\'s a relatively easy game which I suppose is to be expected given it\\'s mainstream popularity, but how anyone got to grips with the controls just baffles me. The hardest part of the first 30 minutes of gameplay was trying to make Leon move through a door! Surprisingly it seems to be a common complaint but i\\'m always told \"If you just overlook the controls the game is AMAZING\" well sorry but I can\\'t overlook the controls, that\\'s the one thing I can\\'t overlook, the controls ARE the game. Most enemy encounters can be handled by alerting the enemy to your wherabouts as soon as you enter the area by firing your gun to get their attention, and then picking them off as they come towards you in single file. Apparantly this is playing the game wrong as most people I watch play this simply charge into the enemy any then claim it\\'s scary when they become surrounded, well of course it is, but your not MEANT to let the bad guys surround you. Despite the camera shift Leon still seems to move like he did in the old Resident Evil games which is hardly a good thing. The story is quite good in comparison to other Horror games, the voice acting is competant and the sound design is actually masterful. Honestly there is very little I can say against the production values of this game, it really does seem like a labour of love from capcom that the game seems so polished. You will probably enjoy this game immensly, but for an old school gamer like me, the fact that it\\'s so clunky and unweildy to move around, aim your gun and generally interact with the environment is a major turn-off. Maybe it\\'s just not my cup of tea. This is my girlfriends favourite game of all time, and somehow she takes it as personally offensive that I don\\'t share her love of it. Then again she doesn\\'t get what I see in Bioshock so perhaps we aren\\'t very compatible.I know It\\'s late to review this, but screw it: RE4 is both considered the \"last\" good resident evil, or the \"first\" fail in the franchise.\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is a great merge from both the original series and a new style, and simply because it has still the atmosphere of the first games, but without being too sluggish on the movement. Sure, it\\'s more action packed and that wasn\\'t what RE was about, but the monsters, the atmosphere, and the feeling was STILL similar to the original RE.\\n\\nFew examples are the monsters, which are still some of the most scary and also varied monsters in the game (the Regeneradores are the creepiest ever), with maybe the ganados being not the usual sluggish zombie, but an intelligent one that can also use weapons...well the solution already came up: they are not zombies, but real people infected with the virus, and the fact that they can use weapons also means a bigger threat. Luckily they aren\\'t the only monsters, or it would have been far worse, but they were creepy, very dangerous and, unlike zombies, they could easily reach you through ladders, doors, windows, everywhere.\\n\\nZombies wouldn\\'t do that...except maybe a few (RE1?)\\n\\nSecond: the game has still a RE feel, and by feel I mean it\\'s dark, dirty, gorey and very \"gothic\" in a way, and still gives you the impression of being trapped despite being in a very large village (if anything, only RE1 managed to get the dark and gothic feeling, while RE2 and RE3 tend to be more modern but gorey). Infact, newest installments fails on that because they don\\'t use the same atmosphere (RE5 is set IN THE LIGHT, while RE6 is too modern, and also more action packed).\\n\\nRE was about atmosphere, music, gore...and also tons of jumpscares: RE4 managed most of these components and added more action and more freedom of movement.\\n\\nThis is where a lot complain but, if I have to be honest, it feels good to be able to move more freely and to aim your shots.\\n\\nI admit, I love the limited movements of the original games, but they were still pretty limited and frustrating, especially since most of the time you\\'re supposed to be a soldier/cop, yet being unable to even aim your shots was kinda silly and so unnatural, and just aiming \"up or down\" wasn\\'t enough(without mentioning being unable to move while aiming...although RE4 does that still).\\n\\nIn here, you actually got to aim specific parts and some enemies require aiming to be killed or some specific tactic that involve aiming in some parts (the previously mentioned Regeneradores are one) and it felt much more intringuing and involving like that. I\\'ll still love how the original way is done, mostly for nostalgia moments, but RE4 still did some good improvements on the movements (minus some obvious exceptions).\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is the melting pot of the old and new RE: the old for its gothic (or just dark) atmosphere, and the new for better movements, more freedom of exploration, better controls and less constraints.\\n\\nOf course I won\\'t agree with some of the changes (being able to get ammo easily, selling stuff and etc), but I still think this is probably the last new/old RE we will ever get, as the newer games are going more for  more action and less atmopshere.\\n\\nHaters are gonna hate, but I think it\\'s worth a check (maybe on other consoles, but this is the version I have).Ever changing environment, a unique storage system, and REAL action commands, RE4 has definitely been a trademark to horror games now. This game is surprisingly forgiving to even new players getting into RE (including me) when you first start off, as most would say you can die easily when playing the RE series.Resident Evil has never been a franchise I\\'ve been that interested in, except for this one, since I\\'d been seeing it on so many best games of the decade and GameCube lists so i got it a game store for 5 bucks and got home played it, and is now one of the best games I\\'ve ever playeda masterpiece of the resident evil franchise\\na masterpiece of nintendo and capcom\\nan innovative game of action and survival horror\\nan excellent gameplay,an exciting story and the best...\\na brave hero\\nLEON KENNEDY FOR SMASH BROS!!!!What memories brings me RE4 ... When I played it for the first time I did not know the saga completely.That imported that, I was facing a game.The story did not have the best script in history but the plot absorbed you and you couldn\\'t stop playing.Graphically it was brutal, in 2005 there were few games so detailed.The gameplay, a better than that of the first Resident, was exquisite.I had never entered such a game before, it was a unique experience.Today is still one of the best games I have played.I can\\'t for the life of me understand what everybody felt was so hypnotic and atmospheric about this supposed \"Resident Evil\" game. It\\'s about as generic as a shooter comes, spruced up with some nice graphics. After thirty minutes of shooting everything that moved, picking up bullets, kicking open a door and repeating, I realized this game would get really old, really fast. I wasn\\'t wrong. By half way through the second disc, I couldn\\'t wait to see the credits roll so that I could get back to the Resident Evil remake, which actually has tense and scary bits. I didn\\'t jump or cringe once throughout the entire Resident Evil 4 experience. I\\'d like to know how Resident Evil: Dead Aim and Devil May Cry could receive such average opinions from gamers, whot at the same time, praise this title as a gift from God, Himself. It\\'s exactly the same premise as the aforementioned two, complete with ridiculous plot, pathetic puzzles (Which sword goes where!?) and weapons upgrades, using money instead of orbs. I\\'m glad so many people loved this game so much, but personally, I feel that it\\'s a shame to see that Resident Evil has spiraled from a completely unique, atmospheric and thought-provoking experience, to just another brainless shooter amongst a myriad of other brainless shooters. Give me Half-Life 2 over this anyday, at least it\\'s fun and even remotely scary.Why can a highly-trained government agent do all sorts of martial arts and crazy flips when fighting one guy in a cut scene, yet only be able to stand still and shoot when a group is chasing him down during the actual game? Even if taking out all the puzzles and turning Resident Evil into a pure action game was a good idea (it wasn\\'t), why keep the sluggish tank controls? He can\\'t even RELOAD while moving! Fortunately for Leon, this game is so mind-numbingly linear that his limited moveset is all you need. This game is basically a shooting gallery, but with Spanish townsfolk instead of ducks.I loved this episode;I still replay it from time to time and it is still excellent today.A must have whether on PS2 or GC/Wii especially that it is possible to have it at low prices;In short go.Easily the last greatest RE title to have ever been created. However, this was the game that put the series in the wrong direction...\\n\\nThe gameplay is excellent and more action oriented which is a drawback IMO. RE should not be an action game...ever...BUT they managed to pull it off in a balanced way, so I can applaud their honest effort.\\n\\nHowever, the story was really weak... I found myself enjoying the atmosphere and the creepiness and the oldschool gaming vibe.  To elaborate, I\\'ve finished the game and I realised there was absolutely no story, no interesting plot or twists...nothing to connect you to the characters emotionally like in RE1,2,3.\\nOr I would have given this game at least a 9/10...\\n\\nIf Capcom returned to this formula, and remove all action elements or at least tone it down to RE4\\'s level.  They would be back in business!\\n\\nI absolutely enjoyed the bosses, they truly felt epic but like mentionned, they were empty and had no background or compelling story at all.\\n\\nMake a good RE game: focus on the story/characters, reduce action, augment creepiness.\\n\\nAll in all this game does deserve praise.. You can tell Shinji Mikami was definately part of the game development... you feel the quality and love.  As opposed to the new \"tae bo/ infomercial\" RE5,6 call of duty shooter.\\nYou young generations have no clue what makes a good game.... Capcom thanks for turning your back on your LOYAL fans who supported the series.I really don\\'t understand what makes this game special for so many people. To me, it marks the point where resident evil starts going downhill, it\\'s no longer about clever puzzles and being low on health and ammo and feeling the next step could very well be your last, instead this is more like a shooter were you are just shooting all the time against 1000 dudes on the outside, no fear, no horror, no anything, just shooting and shooting. And they even add a shop? What the hell, is this resident evil or Counter strike? The game kinda starts to get boring after the first two massacres. Also, you have \"over the shoulder\" perspective but the character moves like in old resident evils, it\\'s SOOOO unintuitive.\\n\\nTo finish, something really annoying was he fact that the action takes place in Spain and the voice actors are clearly speaking mexican dialect, it makes me feel the game is kind of a joke, they didn\\'t even research anything about the place the game was taking place in? I only give it a 6 because graphically it\\'s kinda nice even if it\\'s old and because the storyline was good despite the mexican thing kinda taking away the immersion.THE best action game of all-time.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It\\'s such a step in the wrong direction compared to the trail set in RE2.I think that this game was horrible no offense butjust look the camera angles are horrible,dont know y its over the shoulder,u hardly get any ammo adn there are no other game modes other then story mode, horrible game movie was alright but the game sucked.I don\\'t know where to start. RE4 disappointed me. I don\\'t know know why many idiots out there says it\\'s the best survival horror game. Re4 was NEVER in a million years a survival horror game. RE 4 is the reason why the series is in a bad shape nowadays. The game was so action oriented. It introduced many things shouldn\\'t have been introduced like:\\n_it turned into a third person shooter game (doesn\\'t have a dynamic camera angles like RE 0- CV).\\n_There are no puzzles, and the game relied only on shooting, killing enemies, and the weapons have so many ammos (like COD).\\n_It introduced Quick Time Events (no need for it).\\n_enemies dropping items like ammos and money (why the hell is that?) this is one of the main reasons why it\\'s not a survival horror game.\\n\\nBesides, It has a crappy story that didn\\'t feel it belongs to re universe and because of that I think it was better be off a spin off or perhaps it should have another name.\\n\\nShinji Mikami went to the wrong direction with this game. He blamed the poor sales of Re remake on it, and thats why he made it an action game. Well, if he was smart enough, he would have made ps2, and xbox version of re remake, and this way the sales would had been improved, and he would have to turn re4 into an action game, and the series wouldn\\'t have turned into a disaster.\\n\\nUtterly disappointed. If you have a deep love for the survival horror genre. I recommend you not to pick this game up and praised it the wrong way like most critics did.By far the best RES game to date, so much better than RES 5. A gripping and horrifying game that will keep you guessing to the end, crazy boss fights and graphics that astounded everyone at the time. Lots of guns to collect and upgrade. The new camera scheme is a great change to the series. One of the best game on the console, BUT the controls are a little awkward like you cant run and shoot or reload while running but overall a great game.Six years after the tragedy of Raccoon City Leon Kennedy is tasked with leading a top secret government mission to rescue the President\\'s daughter from a remote location somewhere in Europe.\\n\\nThe first thing players will notice is that this latest instalment in the highly regarded survival horror franchise takes the series away from its roots. The zombies of previous games are gone and replaced with an all together more dangerous foe. The pre-rendered cut scenes and backgrounds have also been removed. Everything now uses the in game graphics, thus making for a more seamless and immersive experience.\\nThe pacing of the game is set right from the start. Following a brief cinematic intro Leon is attacked by an axe wielding figure and then trapped inside a building by a village mob intent on tearing him limb from limb. These quicker, more intelligent enemies induce a greater feeling of panic and fear than virtually anything else in the Resident Evil franchise so far. Of course the usual scares still associated with the series are still present with all manner of twisted creatures lurking in the dark ready to jump out on you.\\n\\nWith gun play a more important aspect of the game Capcom have also seen fit to evolve the traditional control scheme in order to help defeat these new enemies. Controlling Leon can still be awkward at times but providing the player with an over the shoulder view and the ability to aim in first person in order to target individual body parts are much needed additions.\\n\\nOverall Resident Evil 4 proves to be a much needed and successful revamp of a series that had started to become a little stale and will hopefully encourage more developers to be a little more creative with their long running franchises.As a survival game with an intense atmosphere and great graphics, the moment you put RE 4 in the console it sucks you in and let you forget time and space.I don\\'t know why but I prefer the Raccoon city games. This game is great though. Played so many times, just loved it like the previous RE. I can\\'t wait to play RE5 on ps3!I\\'ve completed this game 3 times since it first came out, and each time has been thoroughly enjoyable.  See, it\\'s one of those games that is so deep, so diverse in its environments, that you enjoy something new about it each time through.  I remember the first time playing it thinking..ok...I bet it\\'s about to end, only for it to continue on chapter after chapter.  That\\'s a good thing because this is a great game!The graphics are amazing for 2005 on the gamecube.  The environments, as mentioned previously, are incredibly diverse.  One scene you\\'re outdoors in a rundown village and the next you\\'re fighting your way through an enormous stone castle.  It\\'s a nice mix of creepy survival horror and traditional RE-style turret (stop and shoot) 3rd person shooter.  There\\'s plenty to kill alright, but you also have a fair share of puzzles to solve. I gave this a 10 but would, given the opportunity, score it a 9.8.  Why shave the .2 points?  Cheapness.  As in, you are guaranteed to DIE a few times due surprise button-mashing combo sequences you don\\'t see coming.  First time thru without a walkthrough telling you what\\'s coming up?  Prepared to be frustrated a bit by this--and resign yourself to some cheap deaths.  Outside of that, it should be a fun ride.Simply, Resident Evil 4 is the greatest video game of all time. I personally have put more time in this game than all other games I\\'ve played, put together, and multiplied by 100. I\\'ve beaten Resident Evil 4 around 70 to 75 times, and I\\'ll tell you why. Resident Evil 4 is strong, simple, and does everything that it wants to do perfectly. The problem with most games is that they focus lesser than they need to on CORE gameplay. The greatest video games ever do some things perfect, and nothing more. Resident Evil 4 is simply addictive because it\\'s focused greatly on what makes a game a game: putting you into a moment and making it as on edge and smooth as possible to invest you and get your attention. RE4 has very little things to do regarding the controls. You have the sticks to move (the right stick moves the camera and is virtually useless), you have a button to aim, a button to shoot whence you aim, a button to knife, a button whence held moves you into a jog, and your standard all around action button. See, whence Capcom created this game they spent less time on features, and more time on making the game\\'s simple gameplay absolutely perfect. I\\'ve beaten the game as much as I\\'ve had and I\\'ve yet to even think about the control scheme, movement and flow of the action until now. There is nothing to say about it, it\\'s just simply perfect. Controls aside, the game forces you into itself. What makes a game good or bad is it\\'s ability to make any moment an exciting one. In RE4 there are no dull moments. You are alone the majority of the game, beside a couple moments (one where you are hold up in a village house and are bombarded by masses of enemies, and another where you are aided by helicopter fire), and there are always enough enemies to go around. RE4 focuses on pushing as many enemies toward you at once in order to test your ability to survive. I can tell you right now that there is no other game that you\\'ll play that is as on edge as this game. This game scares you to death, and not in the case of gimmicky monsters, but pure intensity. The game also has it\\'s fare share of great boss battles, all different and puzzling, and not in the typical boss battle fashion of shooting a clearly indicated hot spot. All the enemies in this game are well varied and equally entertaining to fight. Aside from gameplay, the game is amazing to look at. Every environment is dark and well atmospheric. The graphics were some of the best on the 6th generation of consoles, and are still to this day great to look at. The story is cheesy, but you get invested in it\\'s chessyness. They did a fantastic job of allowing some to get invested in it\\'s gimmicks, and for others to get a good laugh out of. There\\'s just not much to say about this game; it runs without a flaw, it\\'s systems are perfect, it\\'s graphics are great, it\\'s story is well entertaining. This game has been spread across, I believe seven consoles, and for understandable reasons. Personally I believe the Gamecube version is the best, but if you own an Xbox 360, PS3, PS2 etc. you also have a chance to obtain and play this masterpiece of entertainment history.One of the best games of all time.  Controls:  I\\'ve noticed a lot of people complain about tank controls... well if the game didn\\'t have tank controls it wouldn\\'t be as scary, is operation raccoon city/ re6 scary?  Horror:  The game isn\\'t completely horror but it has quite a few moments that satisfy.  Regenerators, iron maidens, garradors, novistadors, most boss fights, those enemies really do the job.  On the other hand there are action moments, like the fight with krauser.  These moments, even though they weren\\'t horror, were really fun.  Gameplay:  The best thing about this game is the use of environments to take out enemies and the use of environments the enemies use to take you out.  For example, you use ladders, doors, and explosive barrels on most enemies and bosses.  On the other hand the enemies place bear traps in dark places, behind something to jump over, in tall grass, or in sand, they use high ground, they use giant boulders, etc.  Speaking of boulders, QTE.  This game is the perfect example of when it is appropriate to use QTE.  QTE are used in CUTSCENES, and used sparingly in gameplay.  The AI.  A lot of people give Ashley crap, but her AI is better than any AI I have ever seen, maybe because her job is simple, but that\\'s a good thing, whenever designers feel the need to add people to the combat aspect of gameplay, they fail.  There are many examples of this across gaming.  Halo ODST has invincible allies, sheva in re5 is a failure, the AI in re6 is a failure, it ruins the fun.  Ashley will do exactly what you want to her do, hide, follow, wait.  And that is all you need from her.  She is an unarmed person, she can\\'t fight, her role in the game is for YOU to protect her and if you complain about her dying then you just aren\\'t playing the game good enough!\\n\\nThis game is quite possibly my favorite game of all time.  It most definitely makes top 5.One of the best games ever made.\\nI loved this game 12 years ago, loved it to death, and at the time i hated every horror or shooting game.\\nFew games gave me a single player experience as good as this, Dark Souls 3, The Witcher 3, The Last of Us and a couple of Zelda games.I feel that this game has moved away from the survival horror genre with this game.  Its because of this game that i actually became interested in survival horror and have loved this series as well as the Silent Hill series.  Anyway the game is really good on its own.  The story has started fresh in my opinion by moving away from zombies and introducing new types of enemies.  the gameplay itself is really good.  The new laser aim is a nice addition but i believe it takes away from the horror element of the game.  Besides there are way to many weapons in the game and too much ammo to be considered a survival horror game in my opinion.  The graphics are nice but i think that they could have done a little better.  The game does get boring on replays mostly because you know what to expect and you know what lurks behind every corner.  I believe its with this game that Resident Evil started to drift away from survival horror and lean towards more action/shooter styles.  Anyway this is a great game to play and own if you have been a Resident Evil fan since the beginning or are new to the series.One of the best games ever made, in my opinion. Survival horror at its very best. I must have beaten this one 50 times between all the systems and replays. The replayability is amazing with new game+. I enjoyed every playthrough of this game. I\\'m not sure how to explain it but the game is just fun every time. The first time through it also manages to be scary at certain parts due to the setting and the fear that you may not be able to handle the next group of enemies. If you keep replaying it you can go through with overpowered weapons and it becomes fun in a different way, more like an action game, its almost an entirely different experience on newgame+. All around AMAZING game, one of the best ever made of any genre. If you havent played it pick up RE4HD on 360 or PS3 market place, or pick up an old copy for whatever system you have lying around.Good game, but not survival horror!Fans of the old school is not very pleasant, and a little too easy puzzles and scary moment.resident Evil 4 Resident Evil is not already, and just excellent and linear game!honestly whoever gives this game anything lower than a seven is obviously blind when it comes to seeing what a great game is. this is one of the best games i have ever played.While I have also played the PS2 & XBLA versions, I will review it based on the first version I played on the Gamecube. This game is the reason I bought a Gamecube. It was a step in the right direction a nd a very bold movie from Capcom. The action is good, the graphics are great, voice acting is fantastic (mostly.) RE4 manages to adapt a new approach and still remain loyal to it\\'S survival horror roots. A truly remarkable game that is only slightly marred by annoying QTEs. But these aren\\'t too often and do add a little to the atmosphere. Ashley is annoying as a companion and really only serves as a plot device. But she is likable at least. Overall: RE4 is a great game that marks the turning point in the franchise (and the genre as a whole.)Resident Evil 4 was the rebirth and re imagining of a aging franchise. The controls are tight, the graphics are stunning even to this day, and the gameplay is addictive. It really is a spectacular game, full of excellent boss fights, a chilling atmosphere, and a pretty decent story (although the quick time events suck). It\\'s definitely one of the best games on the GameCube. This game is a bit overrated, but it\\'s definitely worth your time.\\n\\n9.4/10Great premise, creative creature design, memorable deaths, creepy atmosphere and incredibly fun, precise mechanics, Resident Evil 4 was where Capcom took a risk with IP to only prevail, expanding survival horror into an area once thought of as incompatible: action. The potential for this to be a misstep was enormous, as exhibited with Resident Evil 6 the most in a sad copy of RE4\\'s success, but RE6 revolutionized the new field where it emerged, action, along with propelled the whole of survival horror into a new dimension of playability.This game flawlessly redefined the genre without straying too far from its survival horror roots. When I look back at my childhood, this is definitely one of the games I instantly think about. There\\'s such a great atmosphere, and it proves to be genuinely scary. The fact that you have a liability the entire time just makes the game that much harder and more enjoyable.STILL, my favorite game of all time all these years later! I still turn on my old Gamecube just to play it. Incredible game, simply unbeatable. Any gamer who hasn\\'t played this yet shouldn\\'t consider themselves a gamer.Today remains an example of how a title can age like a good wine.The most classic may not like but despite the one weigh and resident Evil 4 with Resident Evil 2 and Remake are authentic masterpieces and the best titles of this mythical Shinji Mikami franchiseResident Evil 4 is my favorite game of all time. The scariness of foreign mindless zombies that you can\\'t understand plotting to eat your brains are scary enough without the parasitic things popping out of their heads. The most perfect gaming experience I have ever experienced.One of the best video games to which I have played an impeccable achievement, an immediate immersion and a enjoyable gameplay I have been a gamer for more than 20 years and God knows the number of games I was able to feel I finished thisgame 3 times, and always with the same pleasureWatershed as on RE\\'s series as videogame\\'s story. RE 4 makes players not needing to play previously three games, the game for itself carries franchise on its shoulders. Even who\\'s not a game, has been played of at least knows Resident Evil 4. About playing it\\'s simply impeccable. Funny, immersive, deep, holder, full of action, nostalgic and has a very-well elaborated story. Not even Ashley\\'s boredom spoils game\\'s experience. Not in vain that has been ported for every possible videogame\\'s plataformOne of the best game ever made, and probably the best of the franchise, it\\'s a Masterpiece.This game is pure brilliance. So simple yet so great. For those who think there are no minigames or anything other than the main quest line, you have to actually complete the game to get there. Anyway, this is one of those games that, if I was allowed to only play five video games for the rest of my life, would make the cut. This game has the greatest bosses of any game that will ever come out.  The early bosses are even better than the vast majority of final bosses in most games. A true masterpiece. GO BUY THIS GAME.Undoubtedly one of the best games I\\'ve ever played. The graphics are spectacular, the gameplay is seamless, and for a good percentage of the game it\\'s legitimately scary. This game succeeds as both an action and horror game. The storytelling is outstanding, and I care about the characters.The perfect game, with a well -founded and long story, incredible and unique monsters.It is not so easy to spend it and the best of all is that you want to play it again.A 10 for this wonderful game.Truly a legendary game. Not only is it insanely good, but it inspired nearly every other shooter afterward. If only the series could capture this type of story and environment again...\\n\\nEasiest 10/10 i\\'ve ever given.Simply, one of the fifteen best video-games of all time; and one my three favourites video-games.\\n\\nI\\'ve to assume that the script was quite bad because it has some story failures and the reflection of Spain is simply absurd; but we\\'ve to think that it\\'s a Japanese game, told as an USA game, so it\\'s acceptable.\\n\\nAbout the technical section, considering the year it was released, I could say that is technically one of the best games ever made. The mechanics can become a little bit uncomfortable sometimes, but they\\'re wonderful. It has also a great design of levels, enemies and characters.\\n\\nIn terms of gameplay, for me it is the best game out there in this century. It\\'s highly creative, well thought out, the tense moments occur at appropriate times, excellent amount of ammunition, and the soundtrack complements all this dramatically. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the ultimate gaming experience.\\n\\nWe have to be critics, so we shouldn\\'t give 10 to all video-games that we like, but this one deserves it.My favorite game of all time. Perfect controls, gameplay, atmosphere and setting. Just immersive and riveting from start to finish. The only downfall of this game is creating the worst female character in gaming histrory, Ashley Graham. But, even SHE wasn\\'t enough to destroy this game.Graphics: 10 Sound: 10 Gameplay: 10 Fun/Story: 10\\n\\nSide-by-side with Wind Waker and Metroid Prime, this is the best GC game and onde of the best all time. Gorgeous graphics. Played it almost 10 years ago and it´s still clear in my mind.Good game but nowhere near all those \"best video game ever made\". Its ok for a shooter and it has some nice atmosphere, but I wouldnt set it in line with the likes of GTA, Witcher 3, Zelda, Metal Gears, old Final Fantasy games or even Mario games. Hell, Uncharted, Half Life and Halo are way better than this.Simply one of the most fun action games (yes it feels like an action game haha) I ever played, very addictive and replayable, looked very good on the gamecubeHas a big fan of the Resident Evil saga, i have to admit that the complete change in the setting was a little to weird for me at the beginning. But after you star playing and you see how Capcom did it, and you see that they made a great awesome game. This is my favorite game in the hole saga, Leon made a great job has the protagonist, and an even better job by keeping it together with Ashley. When you fell like hating this game remember that he invented this over the shoulder vision, and that if not for it, games like The Last Of Us, Gears of War and some others, wouldn\\'t exist. A amazing action game with a few tense moments. 10/10Seriously!! Some people gave this game a zero! I know some would say that it was the end of the whole RE franchise, but to me it was the perfect mix of both horror and action. So giving it a zero is nonsense. This game fixed all the flaws with previous resident evil games like the shooting mechanics. When I was playing it for the first time it felt as if I was in a journey. The graphics are also pretty good, and the game has a lot of scary moments that made me feel really tense. The only thing I didn\\'t like were the enemies at the end of the game, because they could use guns which did not feel like RE at all.The game that changed the RE formula forever (for good or bad), doing it with deep  and immersing gameplay, a long and fun campaign and great replay value.\\nThe cheesyness is here as it always has been, and the voice acting is great.\\n\\nChanges to inventory, save features (and checkpoints) and control felt new and were (and are) a succesful choice. One of the best games of the GC, PS2, XBOX generation.The best 3rd person shooter game ever made. Revolution for the genre and a landmark title in gaming industry.Is so unique and defined gameplay to a generation to come. May caused the Hatred of some die-hard RE fans because is no a Survival Horror game. In anyway this overshadow the brilliance of this game.The change from RE3 to 4 is brutal, I loved how they positioned the camera behind the character and the gameplay they gave him.They maintain the essence, perhaps for my liking, with less scares, repuls and shocks, but they have maintained the fact of being afraid of running out of ammunition and things.\\nThe rest, very good characters, history and gameplay too, much insured, for me the last real re.Very few games do a good job of being, scary, epic, and intimate all at the same. Resident Evil pulls all that off and is debate-ably the best action horror game ever made. It tells a story that is far better than most action and horror movies without sacrificing good gameplay to do it. It does have a few flaws, such as way too many QTE events but even those are done better than most games.\\n\\nGameplay 8 - The sheer variety of gameplay elements in RE4 keep things interesting from beginning to end. Not only is there a lot of ways to play but all of the elements of gameplay work together to compliment the overall experience. There are tons of different enemies types and a good number of bosses that are unique and require different tactics to take down. The game is also quite challenging but as you get better it becomes more fun. I don\\'t think the gameplay is quite perfect, the QTE sections can get annoying and the sluggish movements of the character can seem way too slow at times. Aiming weapons can also feel imprecise. Most of those problems are not major though and once I got used to them I found the gameplay quite rewarding.\\n\\nStory/Progression 9 - The story in RE4 is better than most movies. It succeeds both in terms of action and horror. The pacing is also close to perfect introducing new characters and mysteries at a good pace while also answering questions in a satisfying way. There are many twists and turns but they all work well and fit naturally into the flow of events. My only major gripe about the story was that I found the main villain and the finale to be a bit underwhelming.\\n\\nWorld 8 - Despite taking place in a rather small area, the world of RE4 is full of variety, including a village, a swamp and a castle. Each area is well crafted both in terms of visuals and the story and gameplay events in each location. I did, however, find it quite constricted overall. Most areas are limited to fairly narrow pathways that you can move through.\\n\\nCharacters 9 - There is a good variety of characters and most of them are reasonably fleshed out. Leon fit his role in the story perfectly and was a likeable protagonist. There are also a lot of memorable side characters but some of them did seem a little over the top. There were some really cool villains but they are not the best in the series. I thought the whole cast worked really well together to compliment the story and keep it diverse. The game introduces new people at a good rate and gives most of them enough presence to make you care.\\n\\nVisual Design 10 - This is without question one of the best looking games on the Gamecube. The human characters are some of the best models of their time. The environments are iconic and gritty. The monster designs are the real stand out though. There are so many crazy yet cool looking monster designs throughout. The FX are also great. All of the visual elements feel appropriate and compliment each other.\\n\\nSound Design 10 - It sounds just as good as it looks. The voice acting is solid. The weapons sounds are totally satisfying. The sound effects do a great job of creating a suspenseful atmosphere. The monster noises are also very scary. The soundtrack is not one of my all time favorites but it is very good. What makes the soundtrack so good though is the way it all blends together. Quite often I didn\\'t notice the soundtrack, it just immersed me in what was happening.\\n\\nLength/Amount of Content 8 - It took me roughly 20 hours to play through the game. It isn\\'t long but for an action game it is above average and there is very little time wasted. Every sequence feels fresh and offers something new. I would say it gives you good value for your time. There are games that offer considerably more content though.\\n\\nImmersion 9 - Overall the game is very immersive and I was never bored. The pacing, story telling, and diverse gameplay always gave me something to look forward to. My one big complaint was the QTE sequences and some of the sluggish controls. Those two things did take me out of the experience more than a few times.\\n\\nX-Factor 9 - RE4 is a cut above most other games in the genre, it easily ranks among the best games in many categorizes. It is a generation defining game but it does have flaws. The stiff controls, frustrating QTE, and confined environments made some sections a chore to get through. Overall this game is amazing but it falls just short of being as good as it could have.\\n\\nI give it 88%Poorly designed game praised by people who didn\\'t know any better still wearing rose-tinted glasses.9.7 - Not only a fantastic game in the franchise, but is outstanding on all levels. Game-play, environments, atmosphere, soundtrack, and the fact that you play as Leon again is what makes this game my favorite in the series.One of the games with the highest user score here on Metacritic and yet Capcom continues to take its paths all of his and make resident evil with questionable quality that is not horrible but which keep the name of this masterpiece highThere\\'s literally nothing wrong with this game, well, except maybe Ashley, but that\\'s beside the point. Capcom released this gem of a game exclusively on the Nintendo GameCube in 2005, and it blew everyone away, with the over-the-shoulder camera view to the change from zombies to brainwashed/infected villagers, this game doesn\\'t disappoint. Many people hate the over-the-shoulder camera, but I feel it adds a sense of dread because you can\\'t see what\\'s behind you. The fixed camera angles from the previous entries added a surprise to what\\'s behind the corner, but this stepped it up because you couldn\\'t do that without having to actually go around the corner. All in all, this is a very solid entry in this franchise.One of my top 5 favourite games of all time. Looks fantatsic, plays fantatsic, great horror with great bosses. The gamecube version was the best verison at the time but I personally like the wii version a bit more but that dosen`t mean that the gamecube version isen`t a exelent version.After having bathed with episodes 0, Rebirth, 2, 3 and Code Veronica, the change was radical.\\n\\nThe gameplay was very innovative for the time, and the technical quality of the game was rated.But ... the story is wobbly and not engaging (we don\\'t care to save the unbearable girl from the president ...), in an environment not very credible (among the Amish it would be more likely to the limit!), AndWhat is more far from what Resident Evil represents (and especially how Capcom sold the series at the time ...).\\nHistory only takes on meaning with the DLCs of the time (we will say that), that is to say the modes of Ada.But alas at its most important initial exit was not part ...\\nNot to mention the implementation of kicks, etc, which make the game less ... \"stressful\" (some passages here and there but not much).\\n\\nFor technical qualities and work for the time, I will put 5. But not more ...very cool game, well build and relaesed, but i wanna point out some wierd things on this game, first is the ambientation, appears that happens on northern iberia spain maybe, its dumb way that rural areas on europe are being portrait as undeveloped and very poor, that not true its amazing that capcom doest had any spanish person to be a consultant on game, another thing that is difficult to swallow is the childish and pre-teen dialogs on the game a very scared guy trying to be a super cool... thats dumb and very stupid....but besides all this the game is fun difficult and engaging. Recommend to everyone who enjoys a very well build gameI have finished it 10 times taking out all the content.\\nA game that totally changes the franchise in graphic perspective, playable and history a game with many very revolutionary novelties that gave a very marked evolution to the franchise.\\nThe story: it is normal, not very exciting that the previous ones since it is based more on two objectives, escape and rescue.\\nAt the playable level it is very outgoing giving enjoyment to what is the development of the game.\\nThe soundtrack and sound level is very appreciable and enveloping.\\nAt a graphic level: it exploits what the Gamecube is, excellent graphics.\\nAt the scenario level: very good and well developed scenarios, good amount of enemies, puzzles and good exploration is given to find objects (bullets, etc.) Only the part of the island feels a bit repetitive.\\n\\nGamecube best game, recommended.At the time of release, \"Resident Evil 4\" was a GameCube exclusive. It\\'s also a masterpiece. Sadly, the game\\'s flair has been diminished due to endless ports and dated mechanics. Still, this is a landmark action-horror title. RE 4 ranks up with the greatest video games ever made. The PS2 version (while graphically inferior) is equally as good due to its extra content. I would rate this with a 9.6 out of 10.`` Brutal´´\\nThe acclaimed survival video game saga horror of the visionary director Shinji Mikami has taken a 180 -degree turn which recalls the change made by the sequelae as * aliens * and * Terminator 2 * to his predouncing. Adding a much worse, complex and human plot arc. In addition to being loaded with all possible action. The gameplay is undoubtedly the best of the entire saga, the characters, heroes and villains, they already entered the cult of cult due to their memorable lines, their unique characteristics and a hostile atmosphere in which our protagonist Lion, should sorevive this time. However, history is not his fort. While Resident Evil 1 to 3 games maintained a psychological thriller present throughout the game, worth assimilating to a well filmed horror movie, with despair, drama between the characters and some Screamers. This Resident Evil changes this tone of action with pure adrenaline that seeks to keep the viewer entertaining with a simple story, and some of the suspense of its previous titles.\\nThis title is undoubtedly, my favorite of the series and at the same time, my favorite Survival Horror game\\n\\nJewability: 10/10\\nCharacters: 7/10\\nHistory: 6/10\\nDesign: 8/10\\nEntertainment: 10/10The father of action games in 3rd person as today are conceived.Even today its design and rhythm are still enviable.At all times he proposes new situations with enemies that combine very well so that despite being firing continuously, he never feels tedious, you are always wanting more and more.His atmosphere and above all, his music manages to wrap you as few games.The story is still interesting although it is not the pillar of the game.A true benchmark for action gamesBest video game ever made! If you don\\'t like the game, you are really missing something. It takes what made Resident Evil good and throw it out the window and put something new to the table. Some people blame this game for the sequels that follows but the game itself is awesome. This game is a definition of action survival-horror.One of the best games in the Resident Evil franchise. Camera was over the shoulder which is the first for the franchise and gameplay was revolutionized this franchise.In some ways revolutionary but neglects the series roots in survival horror, leaving an entertaining action game that lacks the soul of the earlier games.RE4 is and will always be a shining example of everything that is good about video games. Don\\'t you dare say \"well it\\'s not great cause it isn\\'t a pure survival-horror game\" because RE4 doesn\\'t need a genre and it doesn\\'t need to be grouped with other games just to give it a label. RE4 is in the genre of \"kick-ass awesome game\" and no matter what types of games you like, that should play no role in your enjoyment of this masterpiece.\\ufeffGameplay super perfect ! Atmosphere amazing ! Absolutely all time no. 1 horror game.Best game ever, no matter if you play it on PS2, Xbox One, GameCube, you must play it, this is Capcom was my for, this game will rock forever.A great action video game but tension at the same time ... and that camera on the shoulder that revolutionized the video game industry .... a great gameplay ... the plot absorbed you and you couldn\\'t stop playing ...Resident Evil 4 has some of the best pacing, atmosphere and character development in the history of games.\\nYou never feel slowed down in the game, every moment keeps you engaged either through quick game play, tense moments or lurking atmosphere.\\nThe textures are dark and dingy but bright and intricate to fit the setting and environmental details help solidify this. The soundtrack really helps with atmosphere building by matching the emotions you feel when playing that setting perfectly.\\nFinally the characters are all likable in their own ways. Leon is cheesy yet strong, Ashley is your classic damsel in distress, the Merchant (i like to call him Stranger) is very mysterious but charismatic, Luis is helpful yet distrustful and so on.\\nThis game is a classic that still gets talked about to this day, a true gem and a game that will never die.… ExpandEverything about this game was amazing at the time it was released. Over the years I have purchased this game 4 times at least. Games like this go back to a time where; whenever you had a problem with the game, you could easily look past the defects because the products were just so dang good. This game was one of those truly fun experiences where replay value mattered.This game is superb, It pioneered the \"over the shoulder\" third-person view perspective in video games.Absolutely masterpiece!! Only after Ocarina of Time, but still such an amazing story. Best RE ever!After 15 years I have finally played Resident Evil 4. and ignoring all the technical and playable difficulties that I have suffered because its launch was in 2005. I have to say that I liked it pleasantly.I would not know much to say since I have not been able to enjoy it either as you would have to enjoy and also would be incoherent to criticize aspects of the games being an ancient game.So the only thing I am going to highlight is the story, characters and the atmosphere.I think the story is very well developed and quite interesting.The characters are very emblematic and are very present in the story.And the setting and context of the game seems very tight and fits perfectly with the rhythm and evolution of the game.In short, it seems very good game and one of those recommendations that would make anyone who wants to enjoy a entertaining and funny story.Absolutely **** The gameplay is perfect, and the controls, although hard to get used to is difficult, have a sort of charm. Reccomend 10000000%!!!A game to remember, everything about re4 it\\'s breathtaking to his epic enemies and boss fights, to his nice and creepy ambientations, a challenging game from this saga, a truly masterpiece.Most definitely the first change to the series from survival horror, to horror action. Yet I still loved this game. (I mean, who could hate on Leon dodging the laser room? That was one of the most epic game scenes!)\\nThis game brought much more use for the knife. It actually held power and usefulness in this game. If you wanted to save ammo, you could shoot the zombie leg, then knife them to death.\\nThe storyline, like every other game, was really good. Hunting down and saving the presidents daughter. Fighting your way through a new addition to the zombies. A new plague. Using headshots, only to have their heads explode, making them significantly harder!\\nThe change in gameplay made this game much easier for the combat aspect. Being able to see where you\\'re shooting, and aim your gun. Killing zombies became much easier with this new style.\\nAnd like all resident evils, the puzzles were still there, making you think to proceed forward. For the longest time, this was my favorite Resident Evil game. It was a hard pick between 3 and 4.Resident Evil 4 combined the survival horror of the previous games with new and exciting action to make a unique and endlessly fun game that completely changed the franchise.I dont know what to say, other that this is one of the best games ever. It was groundbreaking and it is still amazing this came out in 2005. I was surprised when i got this game, and i still cant believe how much detail went into it. Its a perfect blend of sound, visuals and story. Taking a break from the main resident evil story, this game still helped developed leon\\'s character. I love this game to bits.\\n\\nOne complaint many people have is the controls. Personally, I love them. Its clunky and hard to aim, which is great. It takes immense skill and more, which is why this game deserves this review.After playing this game in this time I get what are we missingLove in making games Not in term of moneyThis game has what it takes to be one of the best game of all time I dont get why some people hates the game Is it because of The action in it ?No tank controls?No zombies?I get the point that the series was going reaaally down after tgis gameBut can you imagine if the game was yet another fixed camera with fixed camera and tank controls?This takes ten from meAnd im gonna tell youTher will be no game like RE4 EverrThe resident evil that changed not only the series itself but the game industry as whole, a masterpiece and in my opinion despite more action, it\\'s stille faithful to the original and whit plenty of horror elements...The best part of the Resident Evil series and one of the best games in history.  The game was distinguished in its time in the graphics and style of play and the integration between horror and action and chapters designed with high precision and excellent gradation in difficulty.  Also the face of the bosses in the game was excellent as well as the multitude of enemies and the variety of ways to kill them.  I don\\'t forget the music in the game, especially the music of the safe room.  Whatever you talk about the game I will not give it its right.The game is simply amazing, for a resident evil fanatic like me the game is an overdose of nostalgia, I have no words to talk, Leon and Ada a classic \"couple\" are more than perfect in the game.Good game but possibly not my cup of tea\\n\\nThe gameplay is excellent and more action oriented which is a drawback IMO. RE should not be an action game...ever...BUT they managed to pull it off in a balanced way, so I can applaud their honest effort.\\n\\nHowever, the story was really weak... I found myself enjoying the atmosphere and the creepiness and the oldschool gaming vibe.This was the point of the franchises downfall. resident evil 4 is the second worst game of the franchise, followed by 8.Great gameplay, fun and replayable. The antagonists have charisma, and are memorable characters. No matter how much time passes, we continue to enjoy re4 on different systems. 10/10',\n",
       " 'A standard by which all FPS games should be compared and/or measured against in today\\'s modern world. Truly the best overall game that has ever existed by a great company named \\'ValvE and a multi-platform game which still shows beyond-oustanding PC support to it\\'s most faithful audience and/or customers. This is simply better than CoD, Halo or any series for that matter, genre - RPG, FPS, RTS, MMORPG, etc... the list goes on. Simply put, an engaging story, amazing physics and challeging and innovative gameplay and puzzles as well as deep character development and excellent level design. Get this and any title made by Valve, The Orange Box e.g. has this game and a few others and is easily the best gaming bundle deal of the century because of one reason - it has this game and the fact that you won\\'t find a better game than this, I can assure you and anyone who reviews this with a 0 or something like that because of Steam. Steam has greatly changed and improved over the years has no idea of what they\\'re talking about and should go and play CoD and then start talking as it\\'ll change their mind and they will see, just how perfect this game is, just how much it has achieved - awards, game design, technology improvements and innovation as well as being a pure, landmark title that noticeably and simultaneously remarkably stands out from today\\'s games where campaign\\'s last only about 6 hours or less (compared to Half Life 2\\'s length of approximately 25 hours or more) and do not care about their fans or the fact that the game is complete garbage and continue not to fix or upgrade it. Having said all this... there\\'s still not enough to be said or praised about this title, what it represents, how much it has made known gaming as an activity/hobby, achieved - i.e. (that is) famous, just how good it is and how it deserves to be played by anyone who is interested in anything or any certain type of game as this game is simply put, as the best game that has ever come out and existed and will contine to be so for centuries to come, having its name yelled out and its legacy and origin living on (no pun intended). My PC friends, you will find no better game than this and me constructing long sentences for this game review is completely justified when you understand how good this game is and when you have played it - being immersed and absolutely bewildered at just how good this game is - if I haven\\'t said it enough ALREADY - THIS game is good, more than good, in fact if I could rate it 20/10 I would do so but that would lead to an improper fraction and also metacritic doesn\\'t let me :(\\n\\nOverall, that is all. BUY NOW as YOU WON\\'T REGRET IT, if I haven\\'t convinced you enough - look at the all other positive reviews and take these facts for one: highest metacritic scoring game - EVER, most awards and impressive achievement shown and won by a game, biggest PC community - mods and support and made from ValvE - the people who implemented Steam - a download client program for PC (like XBox Live for Windows) and made many Source game-engine based games that were successful and have been continuing to make blockbuster sequels since then including continuing and expanding this \\'Half-Life\\' game into a series and they are known for much, much more other stuff and being the most awesome people on the planet that make games for gamers by gamers as they say, a great development team and/or publisher of their own games and/or work, need I say more about this game or ValvE... ?!I just replayed Half-Life 2 again about a month ago.  Even in 2011, seven years after its initial release, I am still reminded why Half-Life 2 is one of the greatest first-person shooters of all time.  Not the greatest, but definitely one of them.I think the greatest strength in Half-Life 2 (gameplay-wise) is the level design.  Over the course of I believe 14 levels, you see an incredible variation in locale, level structure, lighting, and gameplay.  This is complimented by such a flux in mood, intensity, and immersion that you can\\'t help but to just be enthralled by it.For instance, the entire first 3 chapters of the game is a slow build-up to an intense climax.  You start as a fugitive, running across the rooftops of City 17 to escape the Combine Overwatch.  You are allowed to take a short, 10-minute breather in a safe-haven, then thrust back into the bowels of the city\\'s sewer system, and finally driving your own airboat through the canals.  It\\'s such a gradual build you hardly notice it, until you reach the end of the climax, discover you\\'ve been holding your breath for the past 30 seconds, and that you\\'ve been maintaining a white-knuckled grip on your mouse this whole time.  And that\\'s the first 3 chapters.After this you are treated to some incredibly creepy locations, and some more intense escapes/shootouts.  All the atmosphere is enhanced with some pretty incredible performances both animation- and voice-acting-wise, even if you consider that this is 2011.And wow, the voice acting.  These are some of the most incredible video game characters to this date.  Immensely believable, highly emotional, subtly expressive, the characters help suck you right into the story and world that Valve created, and you could almost be fooled into thinking they are actually talking to you...Oh and that reminds me, the story.  Okay, so it\\'s not laid out for you word-for-word what\\'s going on, or what relevance all these characters have in terms of the story from the instance you set foot into the game.  I have read a lot of reviews and seen a lot of complaints.  Yes, Valve did not flesh it out in its entirety in the first chapter.  No, you pretty much don\\'t have a clue what kind of influence the combine and the G-Man are right from the word go.  But to be honest, I don\\'t care.  When it comes to story-telling, I personally enjoy the opportunity to discover the story for myself, and not just have it told to me if I were a five-year-old.  There are some pretty subtle hints laying around concerning backstory, main storyline, and intertwining character plots.  If you look for them, you\\'ll find that this is actually some interesting sci-fi, more driven by characters (which it should be) than by what\\'s necessary to pluck a plot twist out of your ass.  So overall, the story ended up being a plus in my opinion.Other than that, the graphics are still good, though a bit dated, physics are awesome, and the gravity gun continues to be the best weapon in the history of gaming,  Go Valve!  Now I just can\\'t wait until my Portal 2 pre-load finishes...This game is a must have it gives a combination of puzzle and shooter. the puzzles are generally physic based and let those who are nerdiest of all shine. while the shooting is great but unfortunately slow to start. but once your well into the game you\\'ll have loads of fun shooting and puzzling through a great story line. this is easily a 10 no question.If only all single player shooters could be this great. HL2 is the shining gold example of storytelling and game play all fused into the perfect package.This game is FPS at its best! No matter how many times you play it, youll either crap your pants or have your mind explode out of the sheer awesomeness of this game!! Incredible puzzles, Frightful and disgusting enemies, superb dialogue, and best of all a gun like no other that allows you to turn every day items to super destructive items of terror!!! I dont care if you\\'re the world\\'s greatest gamer, if you havnt played this game...you havnt lived yet.Alright, i am responding to most of the negative reviewers out there. i have read them.  Half of them are about steam. in 2004.  These days, steam has improved and is now usable, along with a built in social network.  Dont blame the installation. Blame the game.  Now i agree... The graphics are aged a bit... but, you dont complain about a fine wine being aged, do you?  Now you know that the game works on middle-high range computers.  Being overrated and overadverstised...i dont see any commercials for it, or for when it came out.  WoW? Yes, i most certainly did.  Physics, no bullet penetration...thats real life...items that fall to the ground depending on weight and gravity...thats real life too!  You cant say that about most other modern games. Also, these days, modern games are shipped out in a few generic catagories;  Warfare(MW2,Bad Company,Black Ops) WWII(CoD, RUSE)Sci-Fi(Starcraft, Star Wars),Attemped survival horror(Doom3)And Low Budget(Big Rigs OTRR). Half life is a step above because of its individualism.  it also has elements from some of those catagories.  Its a shooter with warfare scifi elements.  Also, FEAR was good, but Far Cry was a peice of Sh*t, and Half Life is the only game ive played that doesnt feel the same as every other game ive played.Gordon Freeman is THE legend. Half-Life two isTHE revolution. The original Half-Life is the game that brought fame and attention to first person shooter, and has gotten this game genre the hype it deserves. Half-Life 2 defines how first person shooter should develope. Simply put, Half-Life changed it all.This is the only game that i can play again and again without getting bored. It has it all: great gameplay, great story, very well-shaped characters and dialogue and an epic soundtrack.  Playing this game really puts you in a specific state of mind. Long live Gordon Freeman and his trusty crowbar!Half-Life 2 is so much more than a game, because you end up forgetting it\\'s a game. You just keep playing it again and again starving for some more. HL2 is not just about mindless shooting and killing... VALVe offers you one of the most diverse gameplay: each chapter has its own mechanics and new weapons, real NEW weapons: they\\'re not just more powerful, they\\'re really different (as the gravity gun). The story is great and very immersing: you know who you are, what you must do and why you do it... It isn\\'t like: \"Hey! that\\'s the story! keep doing whatever you were doing! (mindless killing in most cases)\". The AI isn\\'t great, that\\'s agreed, but it\\'s somehow acceptable because it\\'s not at the center of the game. The graphics are getting old too but it\\'s very well done (I still play the first Half-Life: it doesn\\'t matter) and the physics are still great, actually it\\'s really the only game where you have a real interactivity with the physics.The BEST Game Ever made.... Agree ? I hope that everyone agree. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................… ExpandBest game ever.Seriously, this is the best game of all time. I cant put it any other way, do you remember when sequels meant somthing new to look forward to? I hardly do, but this was in the golden age of FPS. So play it. Steam is much improved since this was released, so dont listen to the trolls.You spend a lot of this game doing repetitive tasks. The game is very linear and each sort of  \\'stage\\' or \\'chapter\\' in the game seems to be really dragged out. For example the chapter called \\'Water Hazard\\' (I think that\\'s what it\\'s called) you tend to end up being able to guess what you have to do next as you\\'ve done it a billion times already. Often you\\'ll also find yourself going on really long-winded routes to overcome one obstacle, which is obviously just to make the game last longer.However I do agree that it\\'s a very innovative and original game, and the graphics and physics are impressive.Games are not about graphics and physics engine but fun*. I confirm some oppinions expressed so far - it is tedious, predictible, it is a repetitive sequel. * Compare some desktop java games on www.java.com with HL2 - then it is obvious you do not need realistic graphics, expensive harware and so on to enjoy computer games. That is true that the industry including Valve misses the point.This game has set the standard in first person shooters the story line is deep the mechanics are unique and all other FPS fall short  to the quality of this game. If you haven\\'t played this game yet mistakes were made, also look out for Episode 3/Half-Life 3 it will be epic with today\\'s Graphics.Short and sweet review, 6 1/2 years after its intial release...Half-life 2 is one of the best games of its time, from its story to the action and \"cutscenes\". I actually loaded it back up and played the game for the first time in several years and it was still refreshingly fun, quirky, and decently paced, There wasn\\'t a single aspect of the game that I did not like nor could find any annoyances with it besides slow loading times, and the DLC episodes were really enjoyable, I hope HL3 is in development or a HL2: EP3, because I would love to continue exploring the half-life world.Many years later and this is still one of my favorite games out there. At the time this games Engine was the only one that truly used Physics, Friction, and buoyancy all together at the same time correctly. I hear people saying how this games physics engine is starting to age and needs to be replaced, first off there constantly doing updates to the engine to make it more \"correct\" and to enable new features and second there are new well known games coming out now that still don\\'t match up to this engine. Hell the new COD MW games physics don\\'t match up to this, there creators even admit that they don\\'t want to spend the time and money on creating a newer advance engine.    Any way the story is great, game play is great,  the whole freaking experience of this game made me happy. I just wish they would give us some info on the Half-Life 3 / HL2 EP3 game....At least let us know that they are working on it... but any way very good game will always be in my top five. Keep it up Valve. your one of the last true video game makers out there don\\'t let business get in the way of qualityThe most awesome game ever made so far!!!! Deserves a 10 and it will get one from me. Excellent story, characters and the story combined with the peril of humanity made the game extremely immersive and an excellent play.Without a doubt the greatest video game of all time. People argue that older games like Mario, or Zelda are superior to it, but if given the choice of having to play a game 15+ years old or a game that was only released in the past few years, you\\'d pick the newer game.Half Life 2 is packed with great graphics, puzzles, dialogue, weapons, and game-play. To not enjoy this game would be like punching Jesus in the face.And you wouldn\\'t want to punch Jesus in the face, would you?Even with an engine that\\'s now 7 years old now Half-Life 2 is still amazing. This game is a must buy, must play and must love. It was the best game Ever until Portal 2 showed up.... But I KNOW Episode Three will be the best game I\\'ll ever play. The story of this game is just.... incredible, breathtaking. The best game of the past decade. You\\'ve got to buy it.... NOW!Best game I\\'ve ever played, without a doubt. I know this game as if it was the back of my own hand, perhaps better! If you haven\\'t played this game, you\\'ve missed out. Get it as soon as you can!Easily one of my favorite games of all time; Half Life 2 incorporates everything it possibly can into an FPS.  There are vehicle chases,  (mostly) intelligent AI, and a storyline better than some books.  Technologyically, the 2004 graphics still feel fine compared to newer games, and that age means that it won\\'t lag on almost any system.  A classic all around.I recently replayed this game, and I had forgotten how great it was! While it wasn\\'t as good as Half-Life, it still deserves a 10/10 for great gameplay, a good challenge, good graphics, a great story, and an overall fun game.With Half-ife 2 Valve proved that Half-life wasnt just a lucky shot. It is a worthy successor, a promise for more to follow and that valve cares of their comunity. Every single aspect of what made Half-Life 1 special was taken care of, enhanced and implemented into Half-Life 2. They kept their special way of storytelling, not interupting the gameplay much, but letting the player explore just as much of the universe as he likes to. A universe that keeps continuously growing during HL1-2, the episode addons and even Portal since it is also playing in the very same fictional Universe.Technically it is not trying too fancy stuff but manages to be beautiful and very functional at the same time.The Game That Started it all for me, and got me On to steam.   Love This game over and over again.  I can play this game, but it is frustrating at moments, just when I think I cant pass a  part I figure it out no problem.In times where it\\'s rare that a sequel is better than the original. Half-Life 2 pulls off that feat with ease--well ahead of its time. Put this on your bucket list if you\\'ve never played it.Half-Life 2 is a masterpiece of the FPS genre, i still remember my first playtrough, when i was amazed by the graphics, physics, the characters, their awesome voice acting, etc.If i wanted to get someone into gaming i would show him/her hl2thx valve for creating this!Half-Life 2 is a good game. What do I try to trick? It is an awesome game! Even in 2010 it offers so much. So, lets start with the good things.Half-Life 2 has nice graphics but you can have a bad computer to play it. It also has a beautiful storyline and there are no cutscenes in this game. That is good because you feel like... you are Gordon Freeman and in the center of... everything. This game has 15 chapters... well 14 because chapter 15 is the credits. Many of you will agree that the scariest chapter is \\' \\' We Don\\' t Go To Ravenholm...\\' \\' . I think it doesn\\' t fit there where it is but they put the chapter in to show the physics.The bad things. Is Gordon Freeman a Superman that he can drive and open doors without hands? Sometimes it is boring to listen other characters because they talk too much. Little graphical failures and they are the bad things. Thanks VALVe for this fantastic game and I am waiting the Episode Three.Graphics: 10Gameplay: 10Sounds: 9Story: 10One of the best games of all time. Awesome story, awesome gameplay, awesome voicing, awesome graphics at that time. simply awesome.ps. bah on the 150 min length.Best game ever made. Are Valve games are 90+ but Half-Life 2 is the best Valve game. I finished 15-16 times. This game contains a lot of new things when you play it again and again.If you want falling in love buy this game!The first and the best!Gordon Freeman will became your hero!.....................................................................… ExpandWhat\\'s so great about Half-Life 2 is that for some reason, you never get bored. If it was me to say, I\\'d think it\\'s because of the fantastic, strong and stable story which always makes you wanting more to know about it. Characters have really their own personalities, the physics system of Source SDK is that good that it\\'s truly one of the most important factors of the game. Valve knew what to do, and they exploded through all the First-Person shooters, even today!This game goes beyond words by how amazing it is.  I actually like this game better than The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (mostly because I suck at that game).  Everything about this game is just about perfect.  The gameplay, the graphics, the music (what little there is), the story, everything.  What really disappoints me is that once games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Halo 3 came out, everyone seemed to forget about this near perfect game.  Why this is disappointing is because this game is actually better than both of them.  To be honest, this is not my favorite video game of all time.  Super Smash Bros. Brawl still beats it.  However, it doesn\\'t beat this game by much.  When the chips are down, this game could still top most competition.  I really want the Halo and Call of Duty fans to try this game out, and see if this is really better than both of those games.  If you are one of those fans, and you have tried this game out, say yes if this game is really better than Halo or Call of Duty.  If it\\'s not better to you, say no, or don\\'t vote at all.  It\\'s your choice.Half-Life 2 is simply amazing. I\\'ve noticed some reviewers (one in particular) mentioned that Half-Life 2 \"has no storyline\". Well, I have one question to ask : are you retarded?Anyway, Half-Life 2 = Amazing. The graphics are good! People have to realise that Half-Life 2 was released in 2004. It does not have the graphics that we have today. Half-Life 2 provides excellent voice acting from all the cast, including the great Merle Dandridge (Alyx Vance).Half-Life 2 also has famous actors such as Robert Culp and Robert Guillaume. Half-Life 2 earned 39 Game of the Year awards. This shows that, well, Half-Life 2 is damn awesome.Great gameplay, great storyline, great voice acting, great soundtrack. Great. Buy this game!There is no better game in the world. It combines elements from almost all genres, from first person shooters to puzzles. The game has some horror elements, and some parts that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. This game has something for everyone.The game itself is pretty good. For being released so long ago, the physics and graphics aren\\'t as bad as you would think. Actually, they\\'re pretty nice. In my whole time playing I\\'ve never seen a texture glitch, or an error in the physics. It can run pretty good with an out of date computer too. You don\\'t need to steal a computer from NASA to play this game well. In fact, that dinosaur of a computer you keep in your back room or basement could probably run this fine.When you\\'re playing the game, you know A LOT of time went into designing and planning this game. It seems that whoever made the game knew which turn you would make before you made it, and planned for it accordingly. The design of the levels are so complex and interesting that I don\\'t know how any human being could create something so amazing. You may walk through a door and find that the hallway ahead is blocked, so you take around five or ten minutes navigating through air vents and dark rooms, only to find yourself popping out right on the other side of the blocked hallway. Ten minutes to  move ten feet.The characters in the game also add to the amazing feel that the game gives you. The characters really find a way to connect to you in this game. It gets to the point where you actually feel like you\\'re Gordon Freeman. It makes you want to laugh and cry with the other characters. The emotions that the game conveys are amazing.To sum it all up, this game is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I could not recommend this game anymore. This game is easily my favorite game of all time. If you have a little money to spare, this is the absolute perfect thing to invest your money in. Every second you play it will be worth it.what is half life 2? not only is it original, atmospheric and beautiful, it keeps you sucked in to the game at all times (provided that you listen to the story line). the only people i know who would hate this game are-surprise, surprise- the CoD fanboys. the only thing they seem to have against it is \"it\\'s too boring\" or \"it just sucks because it\\'s not CoD\". boring? to not be bored at half life 2, please LISTEN TO THE STORY. then you won\\'t get bored! hows that for logic and reasoning, kiddies? this game will keep you playing, and playing, and playing, because this game is as atmospheric, thrilling, scary, and original as FPS shooting will ever get. screw the media, telling you that \"CoD is the best FPS out there\", or the little kids constantly bashing other games, because they think CoD is the best (even though they haven\\'t played anything else), because they are wrong. they always have been.An amazing game.  I spent countless hours playing this when it first came out, I dont know if it still holds up today, but still a game that everyone should play.Eagles Scream! This was one of the most thrilling games ever, Episode one and two are even better. Graphical wise this game is really neat. And the AI is sublime.I\\'ve just replayed HL2 again for about the 10th time and can honestly say it still provides more entertainment, story and game play mechanics than any other FPS in recent times I can think of. Yes - it\\'s a linear shooter, and there is nothing wrong with that if you understand how to do a linear shooter. We don\\'t need constant screen hints telling us we have \"Jump here\" or \"Crouch behind this rock\". We don\\'t need radars or flashing arrows on the screen telling us where to go. FPS games these days are aimed towards people who can\\'t think and need to be told how to do everything. In HL2, yes we follow a linear path, but we also left to think for ourselves, solve little puzzles and even sometimes take on a kind of platforming style unlike COD (and many others) games where we just watch the fancy explosions and get told where to go and what to do (and I just had to laugh at his comment in another review - \"The story\\'s nothing special either. Although it\\'s linear, there\\'s no objectives so it\\'s possible to get lost on where to go/what to do\" - My point exacaly, because you have to think for yourself !). HL2 gets the cinematic approach spot on, makes us feel like we are part of the story where other FPS games makes us feel like we are just sat there watching a shallow action film. Every enemy in the game has to be approached differently, unlike most other shooters where you just aim and hold down the trigger and again watch the fancy explosions and gibs flying everywhere. And to moan about the graphics ??? Seriously ? Why is it that\\'s all people care about these days. To me this game still looks great even today (8 years later is it ? I can\\'t remember the release date atm), and if you don\\'t like it check out the great MOD community (Cinematic mod). So if you like to think for yourself and actually take part in something called game play, this game is for you. If you like a dumb shooter where you constantly told what to do and are impressed more with graphics and explosions, stick to your COD games.Quite possibly the best FPS ever made. People below and above this who have rated it 5 to 0 have either been influenced by how bad Steam used to be (which I can really understand, 3-5 hours installation time is really going to change your overall opinion of a game) and have not remebered that this game was made in 2004. For the time it was released, the story, AI, graphics and physics engine were exceptional and such quality in a game was unheard of. If you want more up-to-date versions of this game that continue the storyline and improve texture quality (and a good chance to see what Steam as it was then turned into; a brilliant idea that other publishers then took up, such as Uplay [Ubisoft], Origin [EA] and the XBOX LIVE Marketplace [Microsoft]) then get Steam and knock yourself out with Half Life: Episode 1 and Half Life: Episode 2.Probably the best single-player game I have ever played on PC. The Source engine has a great eye for detail; portrays a realistic picture of a totalitarian regime, which kindles a real sense of sympathy with the rebels; a squad-system (although not the best); likeable, unique and realistic characters; varied gameplay and locations with some particularly epic parts like Ravenholm (which even now, 10 years later, still gives me the creeps), the hovercraft and buggy scenes, and your first Strider-confrontation; cool weapons; smart AI; an enormous amount of different enemies to shoot; a great story; a great momentum in the game (action-packed and serene scenes alternate nicely); an enjoyable soundtrack adapted to every moment (cf. combat, Ravenholm, etc.), good voice-acting and great sound-effects (anyone not creeped out by the zombie-dogs?); smart puzzles (but just some really stand out), great use of physics; and one of the best first hours of gameplay ever (with a great sense of dependence, realism and adrenaline).Only two games ever I can say that the second I finished playing, that I just started over immediately, being this and Super Metroid.  Half Life 2 is just one of those games that gets everything right.  To find fault, one must look pretty hard.  Valve brilliantly incorporated it\\'s source engine in their true masterpiece.\\n\\nWhen you find truly good games, you of ten find things put in by the developers to enhance the realism.  For example, in Metroid Prime, Samus\\'s reflection can be seen during flashes of light and certain events.  She also interacts with her arm cannon if you wait around long enough, creating the whole image that Samus isn\\'t just what you tell her to do.  This is evident in HL2 in spades.  Explosions deafen you, guns wield realistically, and infinite amounts of care went into character\\'s expressions and tone of voice.\\n\\nThis game is truly an instant classic that has an amazing story, well developed characters, awesome gameplay, and truly impressive depth.  This game is good to the core.BEST GAME EVER MADE FOR ANY CONSOLE. It\\'s as simple as that.\\nThe whole half-life series is great, but this one, this one is beyond just awesome, it\\'s perfect. it\\'s the best game ever developed.This is one of the greatest, if not the greatest game of all times. This game just rocks. From the beginning to the end. It\\'s just........    Perfect!The greatest game to date. I discovered this game only last year and it changed it set the infinitely high bar for all FPS to come. Half Life 2 has the most immerse and captivating story line of any video game, and ideas beyond brilliant. The game makes me angry, and happy, delivers satisfaction and is mind wracking at the same time. A beautiful blend of story, interaction and violence. My absolute compliments to Valve for the cheat engine as well, I had A LOT of fun after the campaign just messing with cheats and mods.But really Valve RELEASE EPISODE 3 GODDAMMITThis is maybe the best game ever made. All in this game is perfect. This game changed the FPS genre that we know today. One of the best elements to tell a story in an FPS that was carried over recent games.Fantastic sequel of a gaming-revolution Half-life. After 6 years, we all got the game all of us expected. And the sequel is even better than the HL! Deep Sci-fi atmosphere, fantastic plot, great realistic graphics, soundtrack and sounds, also animation & dialogs - all this make this game perfect! Today we must say HL2 is one of the best games ever!… ExpandThis is a great game. If you don\\'t appreciate the great story and gameplay, you are not a true gamer. Call of Duty is crap compared to Half Life. The graphics are great, even by today\\'s standards. Even though it\\'s old, Valve knows their engine, and this enables them to have good graphics and low system requirements. Graphics don\\'t make the game though; gameplay does, and this game definitely has some of the best gameplay ever.This game is perfect. Simply perfect.\\nAmazing graphics which are beautiful even on weak PCs because of compatibility and greatly designed Source graphics engine. The story is great, voice acting is above average and sound quality breathtaking.There isn\\'t much to say here, Gordon Freeman is a god.Valve really outdid themselves with Half-Life 2. Never a dull moment, the action segments are riveting and there\\'s no shortage of puzzles to solve.This game is one of the greatest games i ever played, its so huge and so immersing, you really feel like your the character that your playing and Alyx is just the best female character in a game because its doesnt appeal to sex but appeal to women that they can be brave, intelligent and pratical and also she looks like my girlfriend :P but anyways its a great game and im hopping to Valve to release the final episode of this series because i want revenge on what happen in Ep2.No doubt that this is the best game ever build. The lengthy single play game gives you everything you would expect from a shooter; great action scenes, a diversity of good weapons, horror scenes, a great physics engine and so on. This is a game that raised the bar and is up to today still very enjoyable to play.I can\\'t really say anything that hasn\\'t already been said.  This game is great, period.  I would consider it art that should be preserved through the centuries.  I\\'ll remember this game when I\\'m an old man wandering around in my underwear inside a department store.Thinking of buying HL2? Please do - it\\'s one of the best games ever made. The 4,293 other users and the 96/100 metacritic score justify my opinion. Definitely worth the purchase.I have finally got around to playing this game and completing the original which I started 11 years ago! Having played FPS that were released in 2009 and 2010 I am amazed with Halflife 2- the graphics are still great and the level design is spectacular. I enjoyed the zombie level so much that I just brought the left for dead games for 4 euros from steam. All the levels have their own very distinct character but somehow you move from one to the next seamlessly. The campaign has so much variety- you could be driving along the open coast next to the sea in one (with the sound of the sea in your ears if you get a quiet moment) or feeling oppressed and claustrophobic as the evil combine guard infiltrate the apartment blocks you\\'re hiding in. Great game- still have not found any FPS since 2004 that surpasses it.Okay let me get down to it Half Life 2 is practicably flawless. The graphics are great and give some really great effects especially with the physics engine 10 out of 10. The sound design is beautiful from crashing buildings to the moans of striders in the distance. Voice acting is also top notch 10 out of 10. The level design is top notch in every area in the game i have a few problems with one part but that\\'s just me. 10 out of 10. The game play is amazing its always surprising   from level to level there are parts were you will be in a car running over giant alien bugs, then in a town alone with no ammo and full of zombies, then to a full out wars and great puzzles. This deserves a 10 out of 10. The final part of my review the brilliant story. Just like Half Life 1 its all toward from the players perspective Gordon Freeman with no cut scenes. Without spoiling to much its been twenty years after the first game and a alien race called the Combine have enslaved humanity on its on planet forcing people to work as slaves. That is all i will reveal the rest is up to you to find out. It gets a 10 out of 10. So this game gets a 10 out of 10.My gaming experience was strictly separated with HL2 in \"before\" and \"after\". No other game could give that much fun, excitement and pleasure so far. And I doubt there will be one.I even agree for an experiment -- to loose all the gaming experience I have for now and remember only HL2. Because one journey of Mr. Freeman costs so much.Where do I start.  In 1997 Valve made its debut with its legendary title Half Life.  The Game sparked a new era of gaming, and redefined the First Person Shooter by going well and beyond just shooting.  Any one who played Half life, and immersed themselves in the experience would understand this.  Then in 2004, Half Life 2 is released to the public, throwing the player into a post-apocalyptic earth.  Let me make my opinion up front.  Half Life 2 is positively the best First Person Shooter that I have ever experienced in my life.  With its ground breaking graphics, which still compete with games of today.  Its advanced AI systems.  Its superb voice actors.  Its intense gameplay.  All \"COMBINE\" with each other to form an amazing experience.  There is only one issue with the company Valve, and that is that they take forever to make a video game.  However, the end result seems to justify their means of achieving it.  All UPHOLD THE UNIVERSAL UNION!Awards: The Best FPS of 2004, The Best Technical Graphics of 2004, The Best Virtual Characters of 2004. An unforgettable FPS with stunning graphics, outstanding sandbox gameplay and with some memorable characters. The story is perfectly done. Gordon Freeman is back, in the City 17, trying to escape from it. Barney, an old friend of Gordon, rescues him by taking him to a room, and he meets virtually the Doctor, nicknamed Doc. It is a stunning experience, and creepy. There are some AI enemies, like crabs, crabs zombies etc. There are also AI enemy humans from Black Mesa.Half-Life 2... Where do I start. Even now I am still in awe by just how amazing this game is. I wish I could rate this something like 9.9/10; if it weren\\'t for a few minor things than it would have gotten my full appraisal.\\n\\nThe gameplay is varied, you could either be trying to avoid walking on sand to attract antlions, driving around in different vehicles, or shooting through hoards of zombies/combine. Along with this, the game uses a physics engine to make gameplay varied, either in puzzles or in combat.\\nThe story is immersive, well paced, and interesting. Superb dialogue. Along with all of this, the game looks and runs very well.\\n\\nThe game had minor faults. Some areas would feel a little too long, i found myself really only using the shotgun and SMG, the other weapons I would use only once my ammo ran out. The rocket launcher I used basically when I absolutely needed to e.g when trying to take down a helicopter. The ending was great, but left more questions than answers.\\n\\nOverall, the game was just astounding and surprisingly good. If you are a fan of first person shooters you need to play Half-Life 2.Half-Life 2 is really the first game that drew me to the Half-Life series. The original, as of the time I tried to play it, was just too frustrating and the graphics too dated to get into - at first.  Then I played Half-Life 2, and realized what an interesting sci-fi world this was to explore.Half-Life 2 got me hooked, and then I went back and played through Half-Life 1.... multiple times. Half-Life 2 is just incredible, and its hard to believe so many people play such bland... trashy FPS games these days instead of flavorful titles like Half-Life or Half-Life 2. The storytelling in Half-Life 2 is also special, despite being an action-FPS game. Like Bioshock, Half-Life 2 has a way of telling the story to the player while they are doing other things in the game in such a way that the player never really feels bored with being told a story, despite the fact that they accumulate knowledge of the world and all its intricacies throughout their gameplay experience.The physics and gameplay are also masterworks of FPS gaming. This is one of the first gaming worlds that ever felt \"real\" to me. The graphics are superb for their game, and honestly are acceptable by many even considering today\\'s standards, assuming you aren\\'t spoiled by the recent influx of advanced-graphics FPS games these days that have crappy storylines.If you like sci-fi and like FPS, you should definitely consider giving the Half-Life series a try - especially if the somewhat old graphics won\\'t bother you.Superb game, to cover or to reduce, deceased when it is released, I have just covered it with a new gap card, only happiness! ... expandI don\\'t write anything insightful. Half-Life 2 is one of the best game ever made. For me the biggest advantage is the story and well written characters, especially Alyx. Must play!This is a masterpiece of gaming, I love this game for anything that may be in the games! Audience of many millions of fans will attest, for which this game has become something more than just a good game, it\\'s a good childhood memory ... 3I am 44 years old, and a hardcore gamer. Started out when the first personal computer came out. Have played almost 90% of the games since 1983 to 2012. The only game that impressed me to this day in terms of storyline, graphics,  game physics and rendering has to be half-life 2.  Its the only game that will keep making you come back and play it over and over without getting bored. Many times i have started this game and finished it in one sitting. This is how good it gets and still has that spark. No other games will make you feel that, thats a challenge.One of my favourite games, I will never EVER forget the times I\\'ve had with this game. So many childhood memories from this game with my Dad that I will take to the grave. The gameplay is superb with great levels and a phenomenal soundtrack. The story whilst weak, is very interesting and will engross you for the entire game. This is one of the few games I will consider a masterpiece.Half-Life 2 has a great storyline, interesting characters and decent graphics for 2004. What the game lacks is voice for the protagonist, much like GTA 3. Half-Life 2 also has some hard puzzles that I couldnt solve that took alot of time. Half-Life 2 also has a free add-on, a tech demo \"Lost Coast\". Half-Life 2 is a great game, even though there is a few hard puzzles and the Source engine dosent age, so this game is worth buying.Best game ever. Graphics and physics from 2004 and is still better than a lot of games. And a cool story.  I hope Valve will make Half Life 3 someday...Half-Life 2, what to say? It\\'s been out for over 11 years, what else is there to say?\\n\\nGraphics 9/10: For a retro game made in 2004, the graphics do hold up well. Despite being very, very dated.\\n\\nGamePlay 10/10: So Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter, but like the original Half-Life, it\\'s not just, \"Oh I gOt AlL tHe NoScOpEs!!!!\" It\\'s fun, encourages exploration, and the A.I. Is amazing.\\n\\nStory 8/10: It\\'s good enough. Basically this alien race known as the Combine wants to eradicate humanity.\\nSimple as that.\\n\\nSound & Music 6/10: Is this really that important? I mean, the sound-track is good, but nothing special.\\n\\nMulti-Player N/A: Half-Life 2 has no multi-player, so it wouldn\\'t be fair to rate.\\n\\nOverall, Half-Life 2 has held up very well over a decade, and is very fun to the end.Timeless. Still fresh and original in 2015. Excellent art design, innovative levels, immersive story line, great sound & voices, bad ass music... classic FPS absolute gem, The best one to date imo. This blew my mind when it came out. If any one game deserves a straight 10/10, it\\'s Half life 2. Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this (or the orange box)Best Steam game and the best PC game best game made on the planet best game that God Gaben made the best game that has already existed on planet EarthValve needs to make something more like this. Indeed a masterpiece. Excited for HL3. With more physics, stuffs like that, makes this very unique. Best game.An achievement  of gaming history that has yet to be topped. Never has a game riveted me or affected me emotionally as Half-Life 2 has. It is one of the very best video games ever made.Years ago, this game came with every PC I get, never knew why, always thought its overrated, never bothered to play it\\nAfter playing counter strike for a while, I also found the original Half Life copy with it, tried it, did not finish it due a PC format that deleted every thing, I was in love in the first game so I tried the second one\\nAnd oh god, I was never more wrong than the time I ignored this game, this game is still my best game, a game that in my opinion holds the throne in video games, as time moves the game does not age a bit, played it over 10 times and still get amazed about the graphics, AI, story, and map design\\n\\nThis game is a 10/10, no more words can describe how amazing this game is.It is one of the few games that I spend more than 2 times ... but I never tire.\\nIt is a game like those before: a linear story, shots everywhere and a lot of dialogue.Not like the balls that are seen today.\\nGraphics: 9/10\\nJUEPHILITY/MECHANICS: 10/10\\nHistory 8/10\\nSoundtrack/Sounds: 7/10\\nFinal qualification: 9/10\\nPD: Play Half Life 1.Playing this still makes me speechless, regardless of the graphics \"being too outdated\" or what-not Half Life 2 has an amazing storyline and the characters actually have an effect on people and arent cheesy.Eitherway, this game made history.Actually I overgrown most of the games, but I still love HL2.. It has a unique art. A cool mix of technology, urban culture and a lot more that other games just don\\'t have. A very strong visual identity.Environment - whether you are on the street, alien outpost or sewer system seem unbelievably real and you feel present. It\\'s not just realistic graphics and textures, it\\'s the spontaneus architecture.Usual shooter gameplay is spiced up with gravity gun (oh, the stuff u can do with it :D ) .. and versatility of enemies that demand a different approach.I feel this is just too big part of pop culture to miss.. like the big movies, series or music.Quite possibly the best FPS ever made. No wait, it is... Both the critics and users alike agree! Storyline is solid... (wish Hollywood would figure out how to write good entertainment like Valve did) and the action, the music, the graphics. Just everything is badass!if you\\'re looking endless action, endless fun, the best story ever made, the best AI, awesome and powerful guns, strong and really creepy disgusting enemies, the best graphics and physics, great soundtrack, intrigue, emotion, chills, lovely characters, the best protagonist and everything inside a FPS game, then you need to buy half life 2Just such an amazing game. So unique and amazing. It\\'s just so smart. It has such a think story line. It\\'s not just a \"shoot whatever you see\" game. If you like action it has a lot of that but it is also very intellectual. NEVER WILL REGRET BUYING IT!!!!Half-Life 2 is an epic sci-fi FPS, with one of the best atmospheres of any games i have ever played. The game offers intense and varied FPS game play with a great story and some puzzles on the way. Probably my favorite game to this date.Throughout the years, the originality and the way Half Life 2 sucks you in, has made it my favorite game. I\\'ve played it countless times all the way through, and unless I lose my mind, I plan on playing any future release that is put out. Thanks Valve!Best. Game. Ever. Created.Vavle made a big step in the right direction, and since HL2 many game developers tried to copy it. But they will fail, because in my opinion, the only game which will (or could... yeah, Valve can\\'t count to 3) make it is HL3.10 out of 10.Actually one of my BEST OF THE BEST games! When I played it for the first time I was like: WTF? VALVe are GODS! So, if you ask me if its HL best game, I\\'ll answer: No, HL isn\\'t game, HL is religion! :-)Half-Life 2 is an excellent single player story driven first person shooter of the highest quality.  Even having been out for a few years its production values shine through in every aspect of the game. Be it the tight shooter controls, the well thought out level design, the story moments or the pioneering physics based environmental puzzles the game maintains its ability to entertain like few others. If you are looking for a multi-player online shooter HL2 is not the best choice. However if you are a fan of FPS and have yet to play Half-Life 2 you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy and play through one weekend if for no other reason than to play a landmark title in the genre. Authors note: All of my reviews content cover what you should expect when you purchase the game to enjoy it. My scores cover what I feel is the overall quality of the game and may not reflect what I cover in the bulk of my review.I really don\\'t care what anybody says.  This is my favorite game of all time.  Thanks for a wonderful experience.The sequel to Half-Life but much different the graphics are still quite good but the animations are still really good it still is Half-Life so you will know its Half-Life the stroy telling is amazing as well an absolute masterpieceOnce in a while, a game comes along that takes what previous games in that genre had and makes it better. Half-Life 2 does that and it\\'s amazing. For a game released in 2004, it ages very well, the graphics are the best I\\'ve seen when the game came out and it was a long while until another game came along to surpass the spectacular visuals. The controls are not groundbreaking nor spectacular, they\\'re simple and fun to use, especially in vehicles. This is not a war shooter or a bullet-hell one, it\\'s more of a puzzle game at times, but you have to find the puzzles. This game works at your own pace, there are no cut-scenes, it\\'s all in first person, so you find everything for yourself. This game gives you a freedom that most FPS games did not have at the time. If your not spoiled by the FPSs of today, you\\'ll fall in love with this game.Shortly before typing this review up, I had completed Half-Life 2 for the first time. As a modern gamer who has played most of the top-rated games out there, I was curious about this title. Gradually, it blew me away\\n\\nInitially, I thought that the game was overrated. Considering I haven\\'t played Half-Life 1, the game was a bit unappealing. Take that with the gunplay being a bit on the plain side, and I thought I was in for a long haul of datedness. I deleted the game and forgot about it for months. But when I played it for the second time, its constantly thrilling gunplay, well-made levels, weird & wonderful creatures and lively animations opened up to me.\\n\\nThe game did many things opposing the norm: no cutscenes, physics-based puzzles in an FPS game, and ahead-of-its-time graphics and mechanics. The physics are still better than most games today and killing hundreds upon hundreds of enemies doesn\\'t get repetitive as you might think because of it.\\n\\nIts story polarized me. Upon perusing Half-Life 1\\'s synopsis, the story became very interesting. I just wish there was more of it. The game seems to focus more on gameplay and environments, as you blast and drive your way through the Combine. Speaking of that, the universe boasts a fascinating backdrop that treats its audience intelligently, letting you figure out the state of the world yourself. That\\'s something you rearely see in games before or since HL2 came out.\\n\\nI agree that Half-Life 2 is one of the best FPSs of all-time, and to an extent, one of the greatest overall games. On the other hand, I do think that people mostly attribute this because of HL2\\'s revolutionary influence. I know you can say the same about the film Citizen Kane, but I think that films don\\'t get as dated as video games, since they are not virtually produced. I may not think that this game is top 10-20 worthy, but I have put it in my top 40 almost instantly, just like how I completed the game. The game does grab you, and surely enough, the experience is nearly as powerful as a headcrab grabbing you. You try to run, but the thing leaps on to you, and you\\'re stuck in its immense grasp.Even in 2016, this game still stands up well against its modern equivalents as it is. It can be further enhanced with a few good mods to improve the graphics etc.An awesome atmosphere, funny gameplay, intriguing story...\\nA very subversive game\\nthat should be played by anyone,despite genre preferences ( I normally don\\'t like FPS games).\\nJust play it.The best game of all time is what you will say more here ... Even today, there are practically no levels.Oh unfortunately, could create something like Half Life 3 ...Here is a game that I still play in 2015. The game is absolutely fantastic and it gives you the feeling of being an outlaw to the powers that be. If you like a dystopia meets alien invasion meets fps shooter meets puzzle game then you will love this game. Here\\'s hoping that Half Life 3 comes out in the next century!Half-Life 2 could be one of the greatest games I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nGreat storyline, outstanding story-telling and gameplay mechanics that still hold up today.The game is absolutely amazing in all aspects. Really good story and gameplay. Enjoyable and fun.\\nTrue FPS CLASSIC. Big impact in the video game industry 9/\\'10 *When I played HL2, I remember it was like being in a strange dream that seems so real. The design, graphics and sound is epic. What a masterpiece of art. It\\'s simply the best game I have ever played.Fairly ironic that even Half-Life 2 now stands in the halls of nostalgia like its predecessor. It took the innovation of Half-Life and ran wild with it through more modern means like detailed character development and puzzle elements. Some people do not like the differences whatever they may be from Half-Life. I object in the sense that I am glad both of these games exist even if they are different. A good metaphor being you can have chocolate cake and brownies and both be able to enjoy them in different ways.The best FPS the world has ever come to witness. Half-Life 2 brings you through a torrent of different settings, enemies, and events that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Nothing too much should be said as no game of this caliber should need an introduction, but it is suffice to say that if you are a fan of FPS, this is not a game to be missed in your entire life.I love it, end of story. The story keeps going and changing. When you think you got it something changes and keeps you in the game. Graphics are great and the story is compelling. I cant wait for the next installment.A good game done well in every way, I honestly can\\'t think of any critism for the game, Don\\'t read this play it now!',\n",
       " 'CONTAINS SPOILERS !\\nThis expansion, completes the story of the fallen prince leading him to became \"ONE\" with the Lich King.   One of the best stroy telling in its Genre with an amazing story, Frozen Throne is not an easy game to beat in its single player campaign.  One, should play this expansion before starting WOW series inorder to have a full understanding of the events.  It is not satisfactory to read it from forums since it is important to feel like Arthas before killing him in WOW. Arthas had reasons before walking through his dark path. 10/10Best RTS game of all time. It\\'s significant editing abilities with the gift of \\'World Edit\\' forces  the award of the worlds most Advanced, easy-to-use map making technology within the very grasp of It\\'s palms. The campaign is that of a God, consisting of four unique races to conquer as; all flowing into one story of epicness!An amazing game elevated due to it\\'s custom map/modding scene. The online might be dominated by bots and rather empty by now, but it is still fun to play through LAN.VERY awesome Strategy Game, Just like Starcraft (Both SC1, SC1:BW, SCII:WoL) Just like its predecessor, this game is a huge success. 2003 game still being heavily populated as of 2012. Blizzard made a great game, with a great Lore, which as for the WIII EXPANSION next continuation part, is World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King. (Which kept the Lore also), You know i cannot say much... It is Blizzard Entertainment.. They stay true to fans, and they make awesome games. New or old. Thanks Blizz for bringing us this Franchise! (Warcraft, WoW also.)One of best Games ever made and maybe the best Multiplayer Game ever. Absolutely Amazing. Too bad there is only 1 add on and Blizzard only care about WoW now :) But still enough players on the battle net to play with :! Also the Custom Maps was revolutionary!the best game ever nothing beats warcraft 3 stragy its the best game ever i have 100 of hours in this game maybe 1000 hours i know right but there is that much to do get it now go to the store and get it goOne of the best addon overall: It has a lot of content and fits perfectly to the main game. W3 without TFT is almost forgotten. The campaign is great, the missions are much better than in the main game: very different and with many good ideas in game mechanics. Fortunately the graphics is much better now, it looks even very beautiful. In the main game it was horrible.\\n\\nThe only thing, that is really bad is the bonus campaign, the idea to play it like a MMORPG is good, but you play almost all the time with the same heroes only, so it is boring after some hours.Standard addon to the Great Strategy.Everything can only be a panicle.One of the best games ever made in 2000, it made a lot of great improvements of the first games mechanics, and as always has the same Blizzard formula that made Starcraft great. The new units and heroes are alright, and some of them improve some of their factions short comings. The story is quite moving, but the ending isn\\'t what you\\'d expect, but if you know Blizzard you would know why its made that way.The one and only expansion to Warcraft III which just further cemented its place as the best RTS. It added to the base game\\'s campaigns, units etc but most importantly further improved the Map Editor. Allowing even better and varied custom maps to be created by players for other players.Simply a masterpiece in every possible way. It even spawned a whole new genre of games, the MOBA genre. Amazing graphics, sound, characters, UI and a solid campaign make TFT one of the best expansions ever made. 10/10Rest in Peace under Reforged version... This game in my heart forever - never forgive Activision BlizzardI like this game a lot. I liked it when it came out, and I still like it to this day.\\n\\nThe core of my rating is based on playing this game since it came out. Buying and playing the game today does have a varied experience.\\n\\nFirst of all, what makes Warcraft 3 unique is that it introduced the aspect of having hero units into RTS (real time strategy games) unlike its predecessor, Starcraft. Utilizing real time strategy units to strengthen your hero unit is a really fun aspect to the game. The single player for both the original Warcraft 3 (Reign of Chaos) and The Frozen throne is worthwhile, especially the campaign mode which delivers a very satisfying story line.\\n\\nThe multiplayer (battle.net) is a lot of fun as well because you can make and/or play user created maps online, or play against other players in a ladder format. Unfortunately, however, as this game has been around for so long, the multiplayer has become a \\'niche\\'. There is a lot of hacking and not a wide variety of skill level that play online when it comes to playing the ladder, so it can be frustrating. As far as custom games go, there are still public games being made and played, but they might take a while to fill up player slots. However if you have any online friends to play with then you are good to go.\\n\\nThere is also a few seasoned revamps such as w3arena for people who remain (highly) competitive especially in the meta game.The legendary game, for which I spent several years of my life and I do not regret it.from time to time I feel this black void in my stomach knowing I will never experience something as great this ever again\\nI\\'ve played it over and over again played wow for sometime even played all the mods and maps and dota 2 but no feeling replaces the one I had playing the Warcraft 3 and this expansion for the first timeOnce I saw a cut scene of this game, I was caught. Just be caught for no reason. I had played this game for nearly 5 years. Almost all of the time after class, I was immersed in this game, competing with other players. Keep on fighting, no matter how many times you lose, and finally you can improve your skill again and again. I enjoyed this process very very much, but only when I was young. The pressure of you life as an adult makes it extremely difficult and tired to face the challenge with others. I retired, but the happy memories will remain in all days to come.The best game in the two decade. better than crap the reforgedThe beat campaignsBest RTS game ever, however it got deleted from the developers in 2020. Good new here: A pirated version can still be played locally and on LAN party. There might even be a 3rd party service for online multi-player.That game is a masterpiece. Though the Original one was better due to the Plot comparison. But the gameplay itself was more polished that in Reign. And now we\\'ve lost it, after all these years. Good night, sweet Prince.This was an absolutely beautiful game that still held up every time I went back to it over the years. I\\'ll never forget the times I spent on battle.netA great full complement to a great game. New units, a new plot, awesome custom games! Awesome voice acting in my native Russian language.Great expansion that made the best RTS ever made, even better. There is no bad word that can be said about it, so 10/10 is the only reasonable rating.A great expansion pack for an amazing game. If you liked the original game you NEED this expansion pack, no doubts about it. A really good expansion pack.The Frozen Throne takes the best of Warcraft 3 and makes it better. Even by today\\'s standards, this game is just phenomenal. I can still remember playing this game in the hardest difficulty setting so many years ago and constantly screaming at the unfair computer AI in the SP campaign where they mine gold and only 1 Gold is deducted from their mine whereas your mines will always lose 10 Gold regardless of the upkeep. Despite this though, the games was such an experience to behold with Arthas becoming the Lich King and everything else going to hell. The characters were all memorable and I can still remember Sylvannas, Furion, Kael, Illidan and the Naga\\'s stories so many years after I played. The multiplayer was awesome and truly enjoyable with the map editor. You have to give a 10 to a game so good it gave rise to other genres of games--- MOBA and Tower Defense. This was long before mobile phones became smart. This game brings back so many good memories. Thankfully, it wasn\\'t released today or it will be packed full of lootboxes!Simply a great expansion for one of the greatest games ever. Nothing more to add. This is the game that brought the big success that wow now has. If it weren\\'t for war3, I would have never bought wow. This game is that good. A perfect story, perfect multiplayer, perfect meta-game, considering the birthplace of Dota.One of the best real time strategy games in it\\'s time. Multiplayer experience was better than 10/10. Its mods spawned many modern day games including Dota 2 and League of Legends.Loved it since I first played it back in 2005, still loving it today. The singleplayer campaign is extremely satisfying for a lorenut like my self, aswell with a pleasing gameplay.\\nThe singleplayer itself has a good balancing, altho I never played it that much, it is/was great when I played it.\\nBattle.net multiplayer is the reason I still stick to this game till this day, just the ability to create maps and host them is fantastic and the immense freedom you have when creating one.\\nEasily one of the best games I have ever played.Magnificent game. Huge improvement over Reign of Chaos. It fixes ROC\\'s problem of early game massing ending the game and ruining it. Adds really good units and heroes. As a Human player, Spellbreakers and Blood Mage are really good.The amazing game continues. The expansoin is very good, complete the story, brings new units, heroes, tactics, amazing maps. This is much good as Reign of Chaos. ROC and TFT is one game. So if you like ROC go and buy TFT.TFT is the logical followup to the original masterpiece ROC. This addon does not invent the wheel in a new way, but still surprises on some interesting changes in balancing and overall gameplay. The new campaign is fun and funnels directly into world of warcraft. If you like ROC you need to get TFT. As simple as that...In the game is perfect everything. It is graphic, gameplay, campaign, multiplayerI\\'ve played this game many years ago. But it\\'s the best game of my childhood.Greatest game of all time. I only wish I could still play it, but Bobby Kotick has decided that it was not bringing enough money for himself and the shareholders so he shut it down.The game from which are just goals on the skin.The game from which the tears of Radosta go because of the memories of the game in it.A game that cannot be forgotten.The plot, characters, gameplay, graphics, but everything is done great, and this is 2003.Only one symbol of murder of Menetil go anticlials.To understand that the game is a masterpiece, it is simple to derive in Neynado, even now in 2020 it looks great.One of the masterpieces of the century.In childhood, he was inspired by this game, a cool strategy and characters, and the final of the history of the licha true addition to the classic nearing perfection, it is not possible for any human team of developers to make a better addition to a game. A memory to be cherished and preserved.One of the best ever...I must admit that the only reason I didn\\'t give this a 10 is because I suck at it, but (please don\\'t laugh) I managed to get by on normal difficulty. Was I the only person rooting for the Lich King and Arthas? Infinitely enjoyed the last cinematic. Undead rule. Always. When all of the other races die, WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM? Raised by me.This game is a lt more better then the reigh of chaos .It have a new heroes units .I dont like the campaigh some campaigh are predictable and boring.Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne, was quite the let down in my opinion. Whilst the graphics and standard game play remained much the same from its predecessor, there are a few differences which will leave you frustrated and lack any real strategical depth. These are some of the mission you will embark upon. Many of these mission will be nothing more than glorified arcade style jokes, these seem to appear more frequently than one would like and the entire Blood Elf Campaign seems to be made up entirely of these dodgy bore-fests. From lack luster tower defense style missions, to battling over a caged Illidan, you will soon realize that these missions are no more strategical than fetching a cup of tea for your grandmother.  The final mission for the Scourge is just a laughable arcade style joke as well, which has you running around a large and lifeless map, capturing more glowing circles than the Blood Elves. I guess the epic last stand of Mount Hyjal on Warcraft 3 was simply too much to try and top eh Blizzard?With over powered heroes, boring missions, uninspired level design and endings which will leave a bitter taste in your mouth, i can only hope that Warcraft 4 will be an improvement. If Blizzard will actually make it that is...… ExpandDecent expansion to a classic. Couple aspects not polished, possibly from rushed release. My breakdown is as follows:\\n\\n1. Graphics: 6/10 - good\\n2. Gameplay: 8/10 - great interface and satisfying micro/macro control\\n3. Multiplayer: 8/10 - competitive and fun\\n4. Story & Cinematics: 4/10 - interesting story, but some aspects were possibly rushed, leading to disappointment for some.\\n\\nOverall, average expansion.This game was/is the best in the custom game area. I have never played a rts game with better custom maps and i never will. It is not the best rts i have ever played that honor goes to Total annihilation. But Warcraft 3 is right up there with Starcraft for Blizzard creations.Excellent expansion of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Three new campaigns, plus bonus and custom campaigns; Improved gameplay with healthbars for example, which means much in fast battles; New units and heroes for each race; Rebalanced and rearranged gold cost and unit stats. Well deserved 10/10.One of the best games ever made in history. It (was) a masterpiece.\\nWorking from Linux,A pple OSX, Windows XP to Windows 10.\\n\\nWarcraft III: The Frozen Throne & Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos tell the Story of WarCraft equal to the Books Warcraft: War of the Ancients Triology.\\n\\nThe story is great and takes u away into the world of warcraft.\\nThe Multiplayer offers so many possibilities with the community created maps.\\nBut also competitive strategy gameplay in 1vs1 up to 4vs4 games where u build a base\\nget a hero and units and clutch your enemy.\\n\\nAnd remember DotA, LoL and all other similar games came from players/creators of WarCraft 3 maps.There\\'s nothing wrong with this game. If you like real time strategy, Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne does it without breaking a sweat.\\n\\nI tried playing the single player campaign, but I could never get over the \"what\\'s the point?\" phase. This game still had an active community a few years ago when I played it. The only time you\\'re going to be pressed to find the 8 player games is when it\\'s very early in the morning.\\n\\nThe negatives of the game is the personalities of the people playing it, but you can\\'t discredit the game because of that.Blizzard\\'s epic universe not only pioneers balanced multiplayer but also is one of the best RTS titles of all time. Even once you\\'ve completed every bit of single player and got bored of it\\'s classic multiplayer, don\\'t worry because the great modding community will keep you occupied.The game adds some great things (raised pop cap, new units, new and neutral heroes), great story and three and a half very good campaigns. Then the dungeon missions of undead campaign come along, which are not that bad except the last one where Arthas is level two and he needs to run trough the dungeon and fight a really strong monster and his minions (Anub\\'arak shows halfway trough, but it\\'s still kind of unfair), the one mission is cool tho. And of course a \"non bonus\" orc campaign would\\'ve been cool (although noting much happens with the orcs in the story). All in all Frozen Throne is a decent expansion.I dont think..i\\'m sure that is the Best game for people...it\\'s old game and need more intelligence and exp...as soon as u can to discover the mystery of this game u cant ignore it :-)… ExpandIts rare that a sequel delivers another satisfying chapter in an ongoing story. That is why Frozen Throne is so good. It doesn\\'t change the formula of WCIII but it doesn\\'t have to. It builds on what was an already excellent game and delivers the culmination of Arthas and Illidan\\'s stories as well as the rise of the Lich King. Frozen Throne once again has 4 single player campaigns which feature new heroes and units. Among these are the blood elves and Pandaren Brewmaster. One of the campaigns is the orcish campaign that is a RPG style campaign that features the hero Rexxar.\\n\\nBoth the base game and this expansion can be bought for about $10 each or can be found in the battle chest which is arguably the better deal.Absolutely the same masterpiece as Reign of Chaos.\\nGameplay, plot, atosphere ... perfect.If you value games as art, then you must at least play in Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne.This game is a \"must own\" for any RTS fan with its exceptional and enjoyable gameplay, its gorgeous pre-rendered cinematics and a deep and astounding storyline.The campaign is very good at introducing you to the game. The story was ok.\\n\\nBut lets be real here. We got Warcraft 3 for a different reason and thats custom maps.\\n\\nThis game literally offers anything because its almost limitless. Ive been playing the game for 8 years now. Its a great way to pass time when your tiered of AAA titles.\\n\\nIn addition to the game comes the most easiest world editor ever created. Thats mostly the reason why i love the game. The editor is so simple and yet so complex. The freedom of making any type of map is unbelievable. Ive created countless maps and played with my friends.\\n\\nAnd I hope to see Warcraft 4 soon.The Frozen Throne is a great expansion with an interesting story, splendid gameplay. If you liked the original game, as I did, it is worth playing The Frozen Throne. You will not be disappointed in case if you want to learn more about Warcraft universe.This game has the best story ever told in a strategy game with very charismatic characters and a fun gameplay. This game is obligatory to anybody who likes strategy games even toda.Its rare that a sequel delivers another satisfying chapter in an ongoing story. That is why Frozen Throne is so good. It doesn\\'t change the formula of WCIII but it doesn\\'t have to. It builds on what was an already excellent game and delivers the culmination of Arthas and Illidan\\'s stories as well as the rise of the Lich King. Frozen Throne once again has 4 single player campaigns which feature new heroes and units. Among these are the blood elves and Pandaren Brewmaster. One of the campaigns is the orcish campaign that is a RPG style campaign that features the hero Rexxar.\\n\\nBoth the base game and this expansion can be bought for about $10 each or can be found in the battle chest which is arguably the better deal.One of the best RTS in the world is one of the best accessories in the world.When I learned that the complementary part of the two most popular characters in the base game, Illidan and Arthas, was the complementary part, I couldn\\'t do anything with me.This is how you make an expansion!\\n\\nBlizzard took the base game, added some new units for each of the 4 races, added a stunning campaign and improved and fixed all the quirks and issues of the original game. Then they improved the world editor making it one of the most powerful modding tools, allowing one to create fantastic maps, some of which even became standalone games (DotA), and also added support for player-made custom campaigns.\\n\\nThis is a masterpiece, a lesson in game-design. Probably the best RTS ever!I absolutely love this game to death i have enjoyed every minute of this game but i cant give it a 10 because I was never too crazy about the main game play. I was in love with all the mini games the community had made and its all we played me and my friends and to this day we still play STD and castle fight and custom hero survival. Also the campaign is extremely fun if its your first time but i don\\'t see myself replying it.This is one of the best if not best Fantasy RTS games you can get your hands on even today in 2017. 15 years since its release and it still has an active multiplayer community. This game was way ahead of its time and even rts games today struggle in comparison to what blizzard made 15 years ago. Now a days you don\\'t get games like this anymore and its sad, I pray for a Warcraft 4. Please Blizzard. You will find a rewarding campaign in the WC3 TFT but I suggest you start with the first game WC3 RoC first so you better understand the story. When you are ready to take your skills to the next level you can hop in some bot matches and test your might against the pc until you feel you are ready to play real pvp. This game is every bit of rewarding from campaign missions to custom games. and I have yet to touch the map editor but that is in a league of its own.Simply a masterpiece. I grew up with this game. It is not only a great game, it is part of me as a person.It\\'s a very good video game!\\nIt\\'s a very good video game!\\nIt\\'s a very good video game!10/10 must play. Like Age of Empires II mixed with better graphics, more creativity, online clans and forums and LOADS of brilliant mini games that are just as good.Warcraft 3 is a real -time strategy, the plot of which unfolds in a fictional world of Azerot.For many years, the struggle for the planet between monsters and residents of the continent has been underway.In this part, the alliance and night elves against undead and orcs will encounter again.The player will be able to go through the campaign for every race, watching the unique storyline, controlling the new units.Of course, 10 out of 10, although there are no 1000 out of 10. The best online expirence EUER.Capasis of the map and Dota.Thanks to the Blizzard for this creation, I damn love Warcraft\\'s universe and its history.Excellent expansion to Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. The Night Elf campaign continues. I wasn\\'t happy about it being the shortest of the four races in Reign of Chaos but hey it was still the greatest.\\n\\nThe amazing story continues with more cinematics and new heroes. Still many hours of fun and much more. I don\\'t know what more to say.\\n\\nFrom Warcraft: Orc & Humans to Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne is a MUST PLAY. If you haven\\'t played the three first games yet you should download DOSBox, it\\'s free and Wikipedia can tell how to use it. You\\'re so welcome.One of the best games ever! I really enjoy music and sounds of it. Polish version is just pure gold. Campaign is interasting and 4 races are pretty balanced. And this game inspired another game (DOTA) that will inspire other game (LOL). Overall pretty good game except for graphics.This is a game of my childhood, very cool. It was very interesting to play it, although I played badly. There are also a large number of different mods.As good as it gets with RTS games, or games in general. Infinitely engaging gameplay, with 4 distinct races, tons of options. Excelent campaigns, and infinite possibilities with the world creator.\\n\\nWhat are you waiting for?Warcraft 3, This is an example of a game, where timeless design shines.\\nThe Gameplay still holds up even 17 years after release and the vivid Modding community kept this game alife. Ofcourse the Story is another Point where this game shines. Even the German voiceactors sound good, which is a rarity. From the Top of my head, I can recite lines that stuck with me for years.\\n\\n(German)\\n\"Ihr habt eure Männer belogen und die Söldner veraten die für euch gekämpft haben! Was ist mit euch los Arthas?\"\\n\"In dieser Urne liegt die Asche eures Vaters Arthas. Wollt ihr sie ein letztes mal schänden bevor ihr sein Königreich dem Verfall überlasst?\"\\n(/German)\\n\\nThis is the Game that spawned Dota, where People fought each other in Battletanks and where Tournaments still excite people years after.\\n\\nWarcraft 3 is what Starcraft Broodwar is to the Starcraft series.\\n\\nA timeless classic, that will allways be remembered with adoration.In addition to revolutionizing the gaming industry, Warcraft III has been a pillar in the international gaming community, playing a significant part in ushering in the dawn of e-sports, fostering an incredibly productive and lasting modding community and being responsible for the creation of not only the world\\'s most popular MMO with World of Warcraft but also spawning entire genres such as Dota and League of Legends. Its diaspora is heard and felt across the internet all the way down to flash games and fan art communities. I couldn\\'t possibly write a more stellar review. This is game is an example of excellency and majesty to be considered as crucial learning for game designers even in 2020 and a must play for any RTS gamer.Best game campaign i ever player,phenomenal in every aspect, excelent characters  and gameplayBest game of all time by far, it\\'s literally impossible to get bored, there\\'s an infinite potential of new experiences thanks to custom maps and mapmakers.\\n\\nSo many wonders came out of this game, it would still be that way if Blizzard didn\\'t change for the worse and utterly destroyed it after the Reforged release.\\n\\nNow it is impossible to play this game officially after Reforged came out since the servers are gone, but one can only hope Blizzard will do something about that and bring it back one way or another.The best strategy in real time that I played, and the game that had the greatest influence on me.Sorry for Blizard, she was killed recently by releasing the Press F to Pay Respects reform.one of best games ever. shame blizzard ruined it with reforge huge shame :(This game is so great, spent thousands of hours playing custom maps. Most of those hours went towards dota !The best, simply the best. One of the best RTS game even if you put it in the year 2020.This was a generation defining game. Hours before Reforged launched, it was still a staple of the genre. I\\'d pay the original asking price again just to go back to the original version.The newest blunder that is reforged reminded me how perfect tft is and was.Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne was an absolute masterpiece of a game, both in storytelling and entertainment. The multiplayer experience is something i cherish even to this day, february 2020. Who could have thought that games like this one are a one-in-a decade marvel.For me this is the best game ever made.Now Blizzard is destroy this beautiful game with reforged.THE game of my childhood, it was the best RTS i have ever played. It WAS, because Blizzard has officially killed this game, by releasing a forced patch in 2020, limiting the game functionality so it can fit Reforged. Rest in Peace Warcraft 3, 2002-2020 - killed by Blizzard itself.The community of this game made this game immortal thanks to many years of work on creating maps.Wonderful game. One of the best in its genre. Immortal. Not obsolete. A game that will be relevant always.A masterpiece and perfect outcome for a master story one of the few games that in the middle of 2020 can continue to be played and enjoyedTHE best game ever made. Give us the original back, Blizzard. What you\\'ve done by forcing us to take the downgraded version is beyond my intelligence but I hope you listen to the people.One of the best games, with amazing gameplay, voice acting, plot and a large platform for creating custom games.Perfect expansion for phenomenal game. After so many year, for me it\\'s unthinkable to play without it.An awesome expansion to an awesome game. This added some cool new stuff and 3 awesome campaigns to the game, so even though the ending was quite bad, it\\'s still a very good expansion and definitely worth buying.The great DLC of the same great quality game. Just play it and you will understandm why everyone love/hate Lich King/Sylvana and etc.I\\'ve been playing this game since I was 12 and I\\'ve got to say it has an awesome gameplay that would probably last for ages.\\nIt\\'s, in my opinion, a game that\\'ll be imprinted in the history of gaming (Awesome games like DotA and LoL wouldn\\'t have been here if it weren\\'t for Warcraft III) This game definitely deserves a 100/100.This is by far the best game I have ever played in my life. Until today, I still play Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne on a daily basis and it is very fun to play.The best sequel after Reign of Chaos.It is not a sin to mention the editor of the cards, which served as Frozen Throne. A set of popularity.I like to go through the campaign, and in this game I like to do it.\\n\\nP.S.Why come here and put 0 because of Reformged?It is better to make the rating reference to this part 9.9.And Reformged will receive a rating of 0.1 and, as a result, 9.9+0.1 = 10/10.I feel sorry for this deleted game, it was one of the best game it have ever played. The time spending playing custom games and campaign were the best.When people screamed this ruined my favorite game I did not think they meant that you can no longer play Warcraft 3 frozen throne online at all.\\nYou cannot play Wc3 anymore without buying reforged. I have been playing Wc3 custom maps multiple times a week for many years now I can not even login. Just wow.....Keeps on with the great campaign from ROC, with new interesting heroes and units, the music is just as great as in the original one, the multiplayer is just so good with the new maps that it offers and stuff, the automated tournaments, the game is just as great as ROC or even more.This in combination with WarCraft III:Reign of Chaos is (beside Half-Life2) the best PC Game ever (regarding the release time) and a true masterpeice.\\nThe expic single player campaign, the never again reached multuiplayer (beside Fifa, Counterstrike an Starcraft the only game, which was always in the gamepool of the World Cyber Games)  in B-NET and tha mass creativity in the custom maps universe inside are way over the top!\\n\\nWhat a pity they ruined it with the REFORGED release (hopefully the fix all the bugs, polish the game and add all the promosed features - I WANT MY 1500 WIN PICS BACK!!!)An amazing game made by awesome people. Even though the graphics are old, they were so passionately well made that - overall - the game far exceeds 2020\\'s games especially in terms of intelligent gameplay. Nowadays, video games require that you control a character and move it around by spamming one click and maybe pressing three keyboard buttons. No, no no. This game requires you to control multiple units and be aware of tons of hotkeys in order to multitask efficiently in a timely manner and force defeat upon the enemy through methodology, consistency and strategy. Easily 10/10This is my favorite game of all time!\\nThe campaign is great, the melee mode is great and the custom games are great.\\nI followed the competitive melee scene for over 10 years.best game ever after all learing script and creating own spell with World Editor. sadly with new reforged rule, i cannot do that again :(. i love using anime character with Tichondrius voice set xD',\n",
       " 'Probably one of the best games I have played. I don\\'t know why everyone is complaining with XP. I have Windows XP Service Pack 2 and it works fine. Even though its been out for a long time, still worth getting it and playing it. Even after you beat the main game, there is still other parts of the game to finish before truly \"beating\" it.\\n\\nDefinately a great game.Good: Gameplay, Story, Writing, Characters, Music, Setting, Atmosphere/Mood, Pacing\\n\\nMixed: ---\\n\\nBad: ---\\n\\nMasterpiece, definitely one of the best game i ever played (probably the best). Very addictive and fun.This is one of the few games that pulled me in to its story and actually made me care about the main characters as they progressed through their lives. I have had this game for over 11 years now and I still play it sometimes. Mainly for the story line and characters because I actually start to miss them after about a year or so.\\n\\nIf i could give this game an 11 I would :-)The best game I\\'ve ever played so far, and probably one of the rare ones that\\'s worth every penny. It has an original story that managed to captivate me as I advanced my criminal \"career\", good character stories, very good voice acting, good atmosphere, good game mechanics and car driving (an element which I really enjoyed about the game), good \"cinematic\", and good music that combine to offer a movie type experience comparable to the one you get after seeing \"The Godfather\" or \"Scarface\". The game is from 2002 but I believe the graphics will always look nice, and when it appeared it had better graphics that the GTA games that were coming out at the time. It deserves a 10 because it\\'s fun to play and offers me a lasting memory about it.Great game of the original version, this edition even in 2002 is the best to date and has more content and access to the game\\'s locations, compared to the rotten and cheap empty MAF-DE from 2020.What a great game! An almost perfect game which is funny to play, but it also has a very good plot, very good graphics and excellent sound. Games like this will never be made again.Mafia won\\'t hold your hand. It will push you into action and laugh at you. Difficulty curve is very steep, but nothing that can\\'t be passed. And for game made in 2002 by a then unknown studio, Mafia raised the gaming standard by a mile.One of the all time greatest games ever made with a compelling Mafioso story of a rags to riches taxi driver made mob man ... Tommy Angelo. With brandishing characters, an amazing story, and an immense open world for the time it was created in (2002) this game was easily way ahead of its time indeed! I remember playing this as a child and i was moved by how much you can do in the game along with its graphics for at the time was also ahead of its own league. Almost everything about the game is memorable and is polished to near perfection for the time it was released. Mafia:The City Of Lost Haven is a game that is misunderstood to many ... But is recognized heavily to the true gamers and fans of the franchise. A toast to a slice of videogame heaven! This is Mafia 1. *P.S. Can\\'t wait for Mafia 3 it was confirmed today!*I cant really say anything else about this game that hasn\\'t already been said in other comments. Its one of the best games ever made, with a mature plot and believable characters,in a time when PC games really stood out.Story, Graphics, Dialogues and I dont know what else were all perfect. I played this game last year again and even for 12 y/o game it still is very nice. At the time it was pure epic masterpiece.This game is certainly in the running for \\'Greatest game of all time\\', even to this day it holds up well, when you get an hour into the game it never lets you go.\\n\\nIt\\'s a true work of art, that despite it\\'s faults of today still deserves a 10/10. Don\\'t compare it to the GTA series, neither are to be compared, both are different experiences and is one you must try at least once in your life.\\n\\nDo yourself a favour and pick up this gem, since there won\\'t ever be a game quite like this.As a gamer I say this game is my favorite game. I\\'ve played thousands of games all my life but none of them has ever had such an atmosphere. Of Course this is my subjective opinion.Absolutely perfect game\\n+ graphics\\n+ engine\\n+ sound\\n+ music\\n+ difficulty\\n+ Demolition of vehicles\\n+ the story\\n+ The length of the game at that time\\n+ pursuit of realism\\nAnd much moreOf course, one of the best games is not only during the exit, but also years.The plot will definitely capture your attention.He is amazing, unpredictable and will not leave you indifferent to what is happening in the game.Fans of Francis Ford Coppola \"Godfather\" - I recommend to fans of the trilogy of Francis.This is the best edition as the original of 2002 in the best form today and always for all days of life time! A game for the ages! We loved the quality of games in those past years and were proud of it! This is the only version of the original MAFIA game !One game that is made as it should be to your liking that is nice to play today!\\n\\nPraise the developers of the 2000s!Some of the shootouts and \"that race\" are punishingly difficult, but you\\'ll want to persevere for a romantic and cinematic gangster tale that alludes to mafia movies like Once Upon a Time in America and Goodfellas. One of the greatest games to use the Grand Theft Auto clone format, and one of the earliest.Mafia will be my all time favorite game. The story was great and it had so many little mechanics that made it different from other games. for example the reloading system, were you always had to look if the magazine is empty before reloading. otherwise you lost the remaining ammo. this gave combat a strategic aspect, that (as far as i know) no game delivered till this day. i hope, they\\'ll include this in the remake! when i think of mafia 1, i got nothing but love for this game 10/10The greatest game of all time! Peroid. I have been playing games since 1995. and i still have this one game with me till date. I sold everyone one of pc games after i played it even mafia 2 but this game wont just let me go!Great game, fun missions, but the big world has not much to do in it other than driving aroundThe best game i have ever played and it has the best story out of all the games in history. So hyped for mafia 3, but i think this will remain at the best game of all timeI think everyone knows about this piece of art. Absolute legend in the game industry. Story telling is better than in some AAA movies.\\n\\nThis is my number 1 game and I would recommend it for sure!I couldn\\'t give this masterpiece \"10\" because of some minor problems (I had few crashes, plus games has minor glitches but many of them). All and all the story is propably the best you will encounter in video game, driving, landscapes, characters are tremendously well designed. The story doesn\\'t take you for a fool, quite the contrary as you find out at the epilogue. Great game.Mafia for PC is a timeless game, It could have been launched in 2010 year and continue being the best game of the year. Awesome, really awesome game, one of the best ever, and probably the second best sandbox of the history after Red Dead Redemption. Brutal game. Brutal game.For me this game is probably the best game ever created! Fantastic story with an awsome characters, great graphics in 2002 (even today in 2017 looks pretty and charming), incredible, briliant atmosphere of 30´s and amazing with lot of awsome details.. music, story, living city.. I love this game so much! 10/10… ExpandMy favorite game on PC. In the game everything is worked out to the smallest details.\\nGreat atmosphere of the 30\\'s.\\n\\nTo all who have not played, I recommend doing this.The first mafia is a classic, even in 2018, the game is fun and cheerful. In some places, it is even hardcore, definitely taking to play and re-play.I haven\\'t played this one in 10 years and decided to refresh my memory... what a good trip this was! Mafia is still a classic, that deserves a remaster/remake with better controls and graphics. Although some missions are annoying as hell and the controls leave a lot to be desired, I recommend this game for its amazing atmosphere, great characters and story. Pickens approves!Norm plot, 10 to 10, top face top body.What else to say, minus is only alone, the open world is closed.Mafia is an action-adventure video game and a first game in the series of the same name. This game is a true gem, one of my favourite games of all times. Probably the most amazing aspect of Mafia, is the story of its creation. This game was conceived and created by a small team around Daniel Vavra, at the time a 25 year old Czech man with little experience in game development and no experience in leadership. The game was created with very limited budget. And yet the result is a game that means so much for so many. Lets look at the different aspects of the game. The story is just superb. It is original, unpredictable with a strong ending. And there is a message in the story, but no Hollywood, political propaganda of a message but rather actual genuine real world philosophic truth. The graphics was very good for the time and even if you play it today, it is not immersion breaking. The music is another great aspect of this game. Both the songs on the radio and the original theme music are brilliant and help to create the atmosphere of the 1930s so well. Same thing can be said about the various historically accurate cars in the game. And driving them is just pure pleasure. The driving system is pure simulation, something you almost never see in these kind of games. Plus the infamously difficult racing story minigame is also great. I would like to criticize this game for something, but honestly I cannot find anything wrong with it. The save system may not suit everyone, but I have no problems with it. Maybe there could be more of content like secondary quest (beside Bertone\\'s quests, which are very good), but I cannot consider it a negative, that would be blaspheming. Obviously no microtransactions and no SJW politics in this game.\\n\\nThis game was one of the first ones that truly amazed me. I play this game again and again every couple of years now and I am not going to stop anytime soon. Final Verdict: 97 %Excellent game based on film noir. The plot is a central pillar of this video game, but at the same time it is not a boring game. The shooting mechanics are much more interesting than in most games of this type (even current ones). The driving is quite realistic, adding a lot to the immersion in the story. It is an excellent game, highly recommended.Best gangster game in my opinion. Story, hot scenes, voice acting, music, huge selection of cars from that period of time, police law system implemented in this game are unique, car destruction, npc will run out of ammo, and even you can run out of gasoline. I highly recommend getting this game.\\nThe only problems that you can run are technical issues, some ocasional bugs and missing soundtracks that were removed from the game due to licencing.One of the best games I\\'ve ever played. This game contains cars that bend into any shape - 6 years before GTA IV did!The mafia, what can I say, is a game classic.Daniel Vaurus presented his style and turned out to be a gorgeous, realistic story about the mafia.If you combine impressive graphics (for 2002), a compelling story, a great open world environment (It has to be taken into account that this one was released prior to the ground-breaking GTA Vice City), good gameplay and diverse missions (from shooting to stealth to driving), you get one of the greatest games of the decade.Arguably one of the best story games in the history. Okay maybe combat and graphics are bit old but u need to play this game even in 2021.\\n- great story\\n- realisticThis is the best and only Mafia of the original game build!\\nPut the modifications for the remaster on PC 2021 here:\\nhttps://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#mafia\\n\\n-Enjoy!It is a best game I\\'ve ever played.Graphics are amazing,the gameplay is brilliant.I was all in game when I\\'ve played it.Simply the most epic game I\\'ve ever played. The plot, the graphic, the music, the message. This game was so far ahead the other games in these years, and it provided a lot of hours of beautiful gameplay to me and my friend.People must stop compare every TPS shooter game with GTA, it\\'s a bit annoying that if some game is not like GTA then must be bad? -NO! This game is a MASTERPIECE! If you are a true gamer and you played \"MAFIA\" you will know this game is great a real masterpiece as I said.\\nYes it\\'s linear but hey it\\'s a game from 2002 you must compare that too. The story is the best among all mafia/gangster games. Now the year is 2014, more then 12 years has passed when MAFIA came out and it\\'s still the best mafia/gangster game you can play. Other thing the graphics are great for a 2002 game! This game really deserves 10/10 score!How to start ... for me, this game is a masterpiece. This game gives me a feeling like no other game does not succeed. My guess is that the game has all that well developed. Honestly, I have not done just once, but 2-3 times.\\n\\n\"The guy who wants too much risks losing absolutely everything. Of course, the guy who wants too little from life might not get anything at all.\" - Thomas AngeloGreat story, great characters, great music, great voice acting, simply a great game.\\nIt\\'s quite difficult and certain parts are annoying (such as the Lucas Bertone missions), but it\\'s an awesome game that puts all GTA titles to shame.The best game ever made. Brilliant story-line, very good graphics, good soundtrack, which is one of the best in video game history, brilliant made characters and many more thinks which players love in this gameVery high production values and feels like an excellent film, complete with sweeping soundtrack. It is not fair to say this is just GTA set in the \\'30s, it is better and more serious. Although the open world city is huge (larger than say GTA 4), this is not an \"open world/sandbox\" game. You go from one linear mission to the next, and thats fine as the story is interesting and so well presented. This game comes from a time when things were not dumbed down for the casual console crowd - this is mostly good, but some things are quite difficult and unforgiving compared to today\\'s games. This is still very much worth playing in 2014+ if you have not yet, despite the shortcomings of of being over 10 years old.This game was obviously ahead of its time. The atmopshere, the mission design, the story, the music, the setting... Everything seems to blend together. The game\\'s weak part is the freeroaming aspect. Many people compare Mafia to GTA but it is really more common with The Getaway series, but even then, it is much different. BY FAR one of the best games I ever have played.I was totally amazed by the story. Just loved the retrospective way of telling it. I\\'ve played it dozens of times and I must say I really like the difficulty because it\\'s not as easy as games these days.It\\'s still the best game ever. Have you tried these new games like GTA, Watch Dogs, Sleeping Dogs, Driver and so on? Now you must say that Mafia is much better. The people from studio which maked this game really cared about fans, they wanted to hear their opinions. Love the story and of course graphics. Czech republic rules.You can put 100 on this movie without hesitation. I\\'ve played it 4 times. It is the ultimate; it\\'s the supreme game. I\\'m loving it!Things to know about this game:-Its linear (as linear as it gets).-Its Sandbox (but NOT like GTA)-It WAS MADE IN 2002I say this, because i hear people complain about the graphics being dated, the game not being like GTA, and the speed limit being 40mph.But if you actually think about it. The game is not like GTA, because for one it is linear, and most importantly, unlike GTA, Mafias \"main bit\" is the story. A well writ, well directed movie. A movie where YOU play as the main character.With that out of the way, Id like to say that while I played, the main thing that pushed me to continue through is the \"whats gonna happen next\". Maybe I wasn\\'t too much into the actual gameplay, but I can say I really was into the game.The gameplay maybe did lack a little something, but if you complain about that you\\'re just missing the point.The \"speed limit\" is 40 mph but you can go over that by just putting your foot down. Do expect a fine or two though. You also get fines from destroying road posts and skipping traffic lights.Handling is a bit tricky at first, specially with the worse cars, but you start getting used to it and since the game is based in quite a range of years, new better cars are made which you get to drive.Mafia doesn\\'t seem to have a defined \"difficulty curve\" (where the game gets progressively harder), instead missions vary substantially, but that is quite satisfying since you sometimes get very easy missions right after finishing some very hard ones. I personally found the first mission quite hard since I wasn\\'t used to the driving and your car is considerably slower.The story as I said is very well told and contains all the \"cliches\" you might expect from an Italian Mafia game/movie/book. The game was just what i was hoping and I don\\'t see why people would criticise such a fine piece work.Murder, car chases, guns, torture, cars, prohibition, gambling, love, betrayal... exactly what I would expect from a game that chose \"Mafia\" as its title.Mafia is simply the best game I ever played. It was released on 2002, eleven years ago, and it still seems to have been released yesterday. The cars, the people, the story, the atmosphere... when I play it, I suddenly time-travel to the 1930\\'s. I almost feel the fear on other people, the weight os the car in my hands, and the rain falling all around me, as I risk my life for the Salieri family. There will never be another game like it. The attention to detail while developing this game was absolutely amazing. There are no repeated textures on buildings, they\\'re all different, cars can run out of gas, and the gas tank can hit by bullets, you can get fined if you drive over the speed limit, or if you pass a red-light. Police will arrest you if they see a gun. In other games, you can do illegal things, but in this game, you FEEL that you are doing illegal things. I think metacritic should get an eleventh score, so that we could accurately score this game.Its the best game i ever seen. even now in 2005 it remains to be the best game in my chart, and Bricouler, i\\'ll tell yuo why the \"handling is poor\" and so on and so on... because the game is VERY simular to real life, and they obviosly did the cars very real as well and... EXCUSE ME???? \"like in GTA where u have a chance to fight them??? Once u fight them, the wanted level gets higher and higher! whilst in Mafia u have a chance to hide form them. This game has the best graphics, music, gameplay and story i\\'ve ever seen.The best game ever.The most realistic game in its time,great story,exciting missions and gunshots,with a new driving system and detailed cars and at last the best graphic in its time....An impeccable game argumentally speaking, with charisma characters that achieve the full immersion of the player.Without taking into account that it was launched in 2002, artistically formidable because it manages to carefully recreate the details of the city and its surroundings;realistic sounds of it as a faithful recreation of the life of any metropolis.Mafia is undoubtedly a perfect balance between script and game: a masterpiece.While the game undoubtedly has a slower start, it is TOTALLY worth it. Lost Heaven is a beautiful period piece that feels like an actual, living world. The gameplay is nice, and not easy either. It\\'s a MUST BUY for any fan of open world games, crime dramas, or shooters.This is one of the best games of my childhood.I remember every dialogue from the game.\\nI don\\'t think if theres any problem with story or graphics they both are awesome.Back in these days when there was only Directx 8.I will never forgive this game.Its still inside my brainSure, let\\'s compare a game to GTA V when it has 11 years between them... And Mafia II the sequel, many years later. It\\'s not the game\\'s problem if you suck. \"Doesn\\'t tell you how to go...\" This is not a COD fanboy game with GPS dude... 1930... \"Racing Car thing very hard\" No problem at all with that. Easiest mission in the game in my opinion. The fact that you are too young and \"weak\" to finish the game because it\\'s much harder than the **** out now doesn\\'t make the game bad. It makes you WEAK! So stop whining and finish it.. This game is very impressive. 2002...My all-time favourite game! Honest! Okay, so yes, its a bit like GTA. Or rather, GTA is a bit like Mafia... This is MILES more fun. Everything about this game is fantastic. It has an excellent storyline, there are miles of roads and alleys to explore, and the music gives it a fantastic atmosphere. Then there\\'s the cars. These are fantastic look-alikes of real 1930s cars with small changes. All (with the exception of the Ulver Airstream) have that coolness present in the real thing. This game gets even more fun if you add a steering wheel! Yay! Drifting in a Ford Model T (or Bolt Ace in-game)! Okay, so first, the things I really loved: The cars- the great majority of the cars are fantastic computer realisations of the real thing. The physics (both with the driving and the crashing) and damage systems are impressive for a 2002 game- one of my friends actually refused to believe a game this old could be this detailed. There are really cool little features as well, such as working mile counters. I\\'m sure that the car becomes more sluggish the more miles it has done... Also, there are some really cool cars to collect in the subquests and Freeride Extreme. 2) The music- the inclusion of 30s music rounds off the feel of the game. 3) The weaponry- a nice selection of period weapons with acceptable performance. Also, it\\'s nice to see that the AI weapons have the same performance as your own. There are also some random \"special\" weapons that can be found. !!SPOILER WARNING!! My favourite has got to be in the mission \"Better Get Used to It\"- if you stop by the crashed truck in the car chase and attack the guy there, he picks up a plank. Kill him and you can pick it up and use it. /SPOILER 4) The scenery- some lovely buildings and items from the 1930s. 5)The racing level- honestly, this thing should be more exploited by the game developers- you know, add more tracks, a choice of any of the ai cars, and a decent 30s racing game is done... 6) The voice acting- this is of great quality, and expressive. Lipsynching is good as well for a 2002 game. Now the things I didn\\'t like: 1) The driving everywhere- after a while, driving gets boring. You go to see Lucas, and then you are told by your friend \"I\\'m beat, drop me off at the bar first\". so you drive to the bar, then back. \"Hi Lucas...\" \"Oh, hey Tommy, go to the street by the bar and pick up my friend will you, then drive him to the hospital up the road from here...\". Erm, hello designers, maybe by changing the order of these kind of things the game would be, I don\\'t know, less tedious? 2) The Ulver Airstream- somehow, with all the fantastic looking cars in the game, it appears the graphics designers took a day off for this one. The fantastic Chrysler Airflow, a beautiful car, and a design icon, has been totally ruined in its conversion to Mafia. Moving the lights to the wings, removing the big radiator, and making the car available in only the colours \"No-detail Blue\" and \"Vomit Green\" has made such a great car ugly. 3) The autosave feature- okay, this has some good points, such as the fact that it makes the game challenging, but sometimes, it becomes annoying. For instance, in one mission, I spent 15 minutes driving to the location of the next objective, then just after the cutscene my friend Paulie gets out of the car, runs in front of a tram, gets flattened and dies... result? I have to do all the driving again. 4) The bugs. This game has a great many bugs for some unknown reason. These include: lorry driver AI - for some reason, lorries will just randomly stop on places such as bridges, and the driver will just walk off. And not come back. Ever. Then there\\'s the wierd one with the cops. If one of the cop car\\'s doors is blocked, the cops will throw each other out of the car repeatedly, until it drives you insane and you walk over and tommygun them. Then there are the invisible walls that occasionally appear if you do something that the designers didnt want you to do, like drive over a hill into the air at 150MPH and go flying, then crash into a big wall of nothing... And the cops sometimes seem a little overenthusiastic. They will chase you for going 0.000000001 MPH over the speed limit, and they will go crazy if you are on a junction as the light changes. 5) My last complaint- there is no draw distance option without modding. So really big buildings that should be visible for miles just \"appear\", as do cars and people that should be visible. Overall however, I loved this game for its immersive feel, fantastic storyline, and overall great quality.One of the best PC games so far. The atmosphere is movie-like. There are few ways to complete some missions. Among the scenery you can just walk/ride trough the wonderful city and take screenshots. the whole story is worth movie to be made. And the music! Maybe the best soundtrack ever. Cars - best riding experience ever - spoiler! (transmission can get broken; you can\\'t unlock all cars when the game starts; first you should start the engine; speed limiter; manual/automatic transmission and even more). SO, the game is realistic, beautiful and 100% masterpiece.… ExpandI think this is one of the best ever third person shooter games to come out. A note to those who complain about the slowness of the cars, ahem in reality the cars back in the 1930s were actually a lot slower.. jeez get real this is not Need For Speed. And there are plenty of mods available.Mafia:The City of Lost Heaven is a great game! The graphics are not the best but if you see this game was made a pretty long time ago,like 9 years (in 2002).I\\'ve given this game a 9 rating because it\\'s a very good game but not perfect either.The story is great,explains every part of Thomas Angelo\\'s life,and you can enjoy a big adventure in this game.The music is very good,and the graphics are good for a 9 years old game.I saw lot\\'s of reviews were people rated 0,1,2 or 4,that wasn\\'t a decent  rating.These people didn\\'t even play the game or they are some trolls who want to spoil a such a good game!\\nIf you like the \"mafia\" type\\'s of games I recommend to play this game.The best game of all time ....... His music, the gameplay and the freedom to bagar for the city is really the best, the visual level for the time was surprising, although some things were deficient and more missing forpolish but in general it is a work of art ..Gameplay : 8\\nGraphics :   9\\nStory    :    10\\nSound    :   10\\n**********************************************************************\\nOverall  :    9Like Gamespot said, one of the best games of the year...except I would go farther...one of the best games of the last decade. Let\\'s clear this up...it may look like GTA3, but the 2 are almost nothing alike...and this was started before GTA III. (it may have a bit of inspiration from GTA and GTA2 though) Don\\'t be fooled by people who like GTA3 better (and there aren\\'t many...this game rocks.Definitely one of the best games ever on any platform. The graphics still look very good today although this came out more than 3 years ago. Apart from the grpahics, the story, acting, voiceovers, action, makes this game not to be missed.Realistic, thrilling, and intriguing, I wish all games were this good.Even now, after all this years i can assure you, that this is the best game ever in this genre, There is no any other game which i like more then this one.\\n\\nPS. God won\\'t forgive them for Mafia IIIOne of the best games ever. It has amazing music and gameplay is really fun. Even after completing story mode you can always play in free ride mode. Game is pretty long and hard but it\\'s still fun to play. Characters are voiced very well. Bad thing about the game is the fact that some missions are pretty much same and pretty boring.\\nIf you love to drive a car, shoot people (in games) and watch great cutscenes, then you should play this game. It\\'s really entertaining.One thing I\\'m going to say about this game.It\\'s a MASTERPIECE.The story is awesome with strong characters, the gameplay fantastic and the world is so real ant believable. This game is one of the best of its type.You can play it on 13 years old computer from now, and you can still be impressed of graphics,sounds,characters,cars and the manner of treatment..After play this game,if you can still compare with the others,so you must definitely uninstall it.********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************Great game. I just wish it was longer.Most realistic game ever! I usually hate that but for 2002 the graphics, story and authenticity were and still for me remain- unmatched. If you have any interest in 1930s America, a good gangster story or anything along those lines, you HAVE to experience this game. It\\'s sold 2 million copies on PC and it plays NOTHING like a GTA. This has nothing in common at all with Grand Theft Auto. Free roam is a separate game mode.  The actual story is linear, with no free roam. What gets me is how the city is so beautifully designed, it\\'s large, the graphics are a million times better than GTA 3, the guns and cars are very realistic, with a greater variety in them. There is even an encyclopedia of the cars included in the game menus. The soundtrack is STUNNING. But the game is entirely driven by the story and the characters. It\\'s a very good story but also told in an interesting way. The level design, soundtrack, graphics, and realism in everything from getting scratches on your car, running out of fuel and getting fines for speeding to the motion capture and gunplay- all contribute to making this a masterpiece in generations to come. This is a once-in-a-decade game that does everything well, and it was developed by a small team too. This game should NOT be compared to GTA 3. It should be compared to the finest films and novels out there. It\\'s something VERY special that MUST be experienced to be believed.This game kicks ass!!!! One of the best storylines in a game ever!!! Graphics sounds and playability are all top notch... In all seriousness, this is one for every PC game players collection.10 thumbs up to this wonderful game.I first played Mafia many years ago when it came out, I was drawn into the story, found the style fascinating and even though i also had GTA at the time, I spent my hours playing Mafia instead. I recently played the game again for nostalgia and again, I can simply say, Mafia is one of my favourite games of all time. There are so many memorable missions, such as the levels where you attack the airport trying to catch someone, or where you break into a persons house to steal from his safe, or the mission where you assassinate someone from miles away and then make a getaway. The game is absolutely fantastic, and even though some people cannot get it to work, i feel that is a real shame as this game truly is one that everyone should play through atleast once.… ExpandAt it\\'s base, it is a lot like Max Payne minus the bullet time, mixed with alil GTAIII. I don\\'t know who \"ActionTrip\" (who?) got to do their review, but this is an all around great game with a great plot that draws you in even more.This is one of the best games i\\'ve ever played. The graphics are outstanding and the story line is one of the best i\\'ve played out. Im in the process of beating the game for a 2nd time. I would like to tell the people who gave mafia a 1 because they couldnt get XP to work, It works fine on all my XP computers.Great game. Great story. Could have been longer, still the bonus stages help....The game has the best graphics on the planet, they are far better than gta 3+ vice city, you can go miles and miles round a detailed american city or you can go blasting around the country side in a lassiteer v16 that you can get in a 2 story car park on freeride small city mode, drive around the working quarters/ industrial district next to an hardware store \\'\\'lost heaven hardware co\\'\\'. drive up the ramp and in the corner on the second level should be a large green car, its unlocked! drive it fast and see the money fall into your bloody killer hands.MAFIA is one of the best games ever made ! It kicks the crap out of Vice City & gta3.Awesome Graphics...faces, cars, animations...Awesome Gameplay...unlike GTA 3 and Vice City the missions are fun...It runs extremely awesome on my Radeon 9200 with 1280x1024 resolution all details up and Anti-Aliasing 4x. O yea the best thing was IT WAS $10!!!!!!!!!Still my favorite game now in 2005. this filmlike story (cosa nostra) with great voices, amazig graphics and several perfectly smart levels, huge and complex - hard to describe. just GREAT. And as for the guy who \"cannot drive around\" - just not true, after you finish the game, prety optional freedrive & freedrive extreme open with helluva hard tasks. but as i said, this games rocks... and compliments to the check programmers, they\\'ve copied vienna (austria) art museum 1:1, i was amased, since i\\'ve been working there as studen, and spent hours and hous in the museum. nice one. with message too! Probably one of the best games ever in its genre. The atmosphere, the storyline and the great deal of possibilities left to the player are all well composed and fit seamlessly together. The artistic detail of the virtual world (city and exteriors) is astonishing as for the date of release. There is just one emminent drawback to the game. The player cannot save during missions, so he must start the whole mission all over again, if he dies. But, after some time one becomes used to it and develops survival techniques to prevent rash deaths. Even though some technical glitches remain, even after the release of patches, the concept of the game and the devotion it was made with qualifies it for highest rankings. I not only recommand everyone just to play it, but to even recommand it further!Given we have had Scarface and The Godfather games, who would have thought a fictional gangster game called Mafia could outdo them both and be the No.1 game to immerse you into the world of the 30;s and the life of a Mafiosi!This is a truly amazing game, its got everything, the story is engrossing and the car chases and firefights are ace! beats the hell out of GTA! GET IT NOW!!!!Great game , great story.Finished 3 times and the secret levels that open funny cars.One of the best games Ive played. The story line is amazing. HUGE city to explore. Very realistic. It makes you feel like you actually lived during this time period. The cars drive like they should. As the game progresses so do the cars. They get more horsepower and get less boxy looking. It keeps the game interesting. Once again the story line is awesome. I always kinda wanted them to write a graphic novel or something based on this game.A neat premise is ruined by a moronic leveling system, cardbord characters, a cliched story, and bland environments. I had some fun with it, granted, but it was not what it claimed to be, and was simply mediocre.Let\\'s be honest, this is a seriously overrated game. Nobody wants to admit it, but it\\'s pretty weak. The only thing it\\'s got going for it is the graphics, which were incredible for the time. But the gameplay just isn\\'t fun, the driving physics are awful, the fact that you have to drive everywhere is boring as hell, it\\'s mercilessly hard and full of bugs. I usually always finish a game, but I had to give up. That racing car mission was a nightmare, and that church level? Despite the hilarious bugs of seeing a fat guy crawling through the air, it was simply terrible. It\\'s not that I don\\'t enjoy a challenge, it\\'s that I can\\'t stand having to do the same thing thirty-odd times because of poor game design.\\n\\nAnd people still jump at the chance to praise the story, and all I can say is... what story? It\\'s just a load of stereotypical, annoying and generic \\'gangster\\'-style missions and scenarios strung together by some pretty poor voice acting.\\n\\nThis game is nothing short of a total pain that hasn\\'t aged well at all. But thankfully, the sequel fixes many of these problems and is a very enjoyable game. I\\'d recommend Mafia II, but this one? I\\'d avoid.Easily one of the best, if not, the best game I have ever played. I wish more games had stories laid out like this. It truly is like playing out a character in the movie. It never disappoints from the start and from the very end. A++Amazing.It\\'s a great game and it\\'s like watching a real time movie.The missions are fun, but as a GTA knock-off it leaves a lot to be desired. Many aspects of the game are pretty frustrating, and I\\'m not sure how everyone else has overlooked the fact that it\\'s extremely buggy.I haven\\'t even come close to finishing it and I probably won\\'t. The story is fine enough on its own, but the game built around it is mediocre at best. The biggest problem is the gameplay, while not exactly broken, is infuriating. You have so little health that you die before you have time to react, something about the gun mechanics just feels off, driving is difficult and while I might joke about the fact that the cops in the GTA series are fine with you going 100 miles an hour in oncoming traffic but try to kill you if you accidentally scrape one of their cars, I don\\'t mean I want to get pulled over for driving above 40!\\nAll in all, decent potential, but ruined by a few poor design decisions.I registered into metacritic only to tell you how awful this game is. It\\'s buggy as h*ll, the gameplay is sh*t and most of the game is driving long distances with slow cars. AND THE DRIVING ITSELF IS THE MOST HORRIBLE THING IN THIS GAME AND 90% OF GAMEPLAY TIME YOU JUST DRIVE!!! I hate this game. Cops are only to annoy you: they don\\'t care if gangsters shoot at you or break the speed limit, but if you even have a gun in your hand or drive over 40mph, they\\'re after you. You can pull over and let the officer write you a fine, takes about 30secs extra, or just keep driving, which causes the cops want to arrest you. If they get you arrested, the game is over and you have to load from a checkpoint (and then you have to drive AGAIN THAT SAME ROUTE). There are no quick saves and there are few checkpoints per mission. Missions are annoying to complish and slow tempo.  The only thing that is good, is some parts of the story. This unrealistic, annoying piece of s*it was waste of 5 euros. Yes, even L.A. Noire is hundreds of times better than this.Pretty good tutorial, but that\\'s about it. The AI likes to get hit by cars making you lose the level. The cars are extremely slow and even struggle to get up bridges and if you damage the car enough forget about driving up the bridge, you\\'re walking. Shame, because most of the missions involve driving.Awful game.  Getting pulled over for speeding at 40mph is just irritating as hell.  A lot of missions are impossible because you die way too easily and you don\\'t have enough ammo.  This game was just a god awful experience and I quit playing it after a few missions.  Just terrible all around.They don\\'t date this reviews, so it\\'s hard to say what everyone else was used to. For 2005 though, this game is a prime example of developers who had no idea what makes a game fun to play. Endless driving through the city back and forth, underpowered, poor handling cars, and an environment full of police who jump on you the moment you travel over 40mph. (The cars even have a governor so you can stay within the speed limit, which you really have to do most of the time since unlike GTA where you have a fighting chance against them, unless you hide from the police in MAFIA, you\\'re going to lose. A decent storyline, some nice graphics, and an otherwise fun game marred by level designers more interested in showing off their handiwork than in providing a fun experience for the user. Unless you\\'re bored, I\\'d recommend skipping this one.Sorry but tons of users cant get this game to work, myself included.. Huge driver problems with XP, and Soundblasters. Blame who you will but no patch, and no patches planned... Buggy.This really sucks. I have xp and my graphics are horrible. I can see through walls and i can only see the wheels on the cars. what is dis. how i fix dis shoot.',\n",
       " 'Although I picked up Warcraft 3 came out in 2002, It is still the game I play most, and it has a lot of competition. I play Call of Duty 4, World of Warcraft, Half Life 2 and its various mods, and many others. Even with all these games I have played Warcraft 3 the most, simply from its huge replay value and epic storyline. The game\\'s single player it huge and varied. No two missions are alike. Even if you dislike standard Warcraft 3 combat, run on over to battle.net! The multiplayer has a huge amount of player made maps, things that range from games that are alterations of normal Warcraft 3 base building and fighting, to 3rd person shooters like Elimination Tournament. Some people dislike the game, thinking that the battles are to small, and your largest army is around 18 people. But trust me, with every unit being unique, and when maps can be up to 6 v 6, the battles are huge, and you have to manage many differant units making it a long, intense battle. One of the best games of all time.This is by far my number one favorite game of all-time, it\\'s more than 10 years old and i still play it every once in a while! Where do i begin? Well lets start with the campaign, probably one of the best stories i have ever seen in a video game. And the cinematics? They\\'re more than ten years old and yet they still impress me every time. Most missions are awesome and those who aren\\'t are still quite nice. The multiplayer is really great. Building up your army, researching new tech and leveling up your hero all while having to keep up your economy. No games a the same in Warcraft 3. And if you should ever get bored with the normal maps, you can just log on to Battlenet or Epicwar to check out the newest custom maps. One of the only games that i have been completely sure deserves a 10/10.As far as RTS games go, this one\\'s top notch.  It\\'s different enough from Starcraft for me to want to play it, and the campaign is top notch.  Of course the graphics have aged a bit, but it is years old at this point.The SinglePlayer mode was great, and the story is very good aswell, it wants you play the game till the end! Cinematics are great aswell and the Multiplayer mode was just fantastic. And if you got bored of it, there were Tons of Mods that you could play that were entirely different then the actual game ( DOTA, Tower Defense, etc etc etc )This game is an highly excellent game.Story is good and even game play is good.So I finished the game in 30 hours and I know that It took me a long time to finish the game but It is worth the time playing.Game is highly good and maybe this game is one of the best the past decade.I\\'m telling you go play this game now and try to finish the game.One of the best games ever! I really enjoy music and sounds of it. Polish version is just pure gold. Campaign is interasting and 4 races are pretty balanced. And this game inspired another game (DOTA) that will inspire other game (LOL). Overall pretty good game except for graphics.Might be the only 10 I ever give. I said in another review that I couldn\\'t give a perfect score unless something was perfect, well Warcraft 3 is. If there\\'s a bug in the game, I can\\'t find it. It continues to have support 9 years after it\\'s release and has spawned a community and gaming franchises that will last probably forever. From this came DotA, LOL, WoW (the MMO), soon to be DOTA2 and who knows what else. Earlier this year Blizzard patched the game to accommodate DotA players and added widescreen support and resolutions. Online play is still free and yes there are still people playing. The single player campaign itself is one of, if not THE most influential RTS games in history. It added customizable heroes along with a plethora of key commands and unit controls that are still used today in countless games. Blizzard even copied this UI for Starcraft 2. 9 years later, this is still one of the most fun games I have ever played and includes an entertaining story and loads of play time (I don\\'t know for sure how many hours, but 30+ would be conservative). If you like lore, here it lives and it\\'s full to overflowing. The developers went above and beyond with this game adding in comical interludes like exploding sheep when you click on them....a lot, to catch phrases and humorous comments from the units when they are clicked repeatedly. My favorite is the sorceress saying \"Kick down sparky\", I\\'ve been repeating it for years. The gameplay is complicated enough to be engaging and challenging but simple enough for anyone to pick up and be successful. It truly is a game with something for everyone and with what has grown from it and it\\'s staying power it\\'s hard to call it anything but perfect.By far the best RTS I have ever played. The campaign and the custom games are just awsome.  I strongly recommend this game to everyone who\\'s into this genre.Ah, Warcraft III, one of the first games I played. This game has some quite interesting characters. The gameplay mechanics. The multiplayer is fun and varied as well. Soundtrack is pleasing and sound effects are good. The graphics for the time were nicely done. Overall, a nice, fun game.Seriously, this is one of the best RTS games known to date. The factions are equally balanced for each race, with specific counters for each kind. They all have their own gameplay which can be used by pros to their advantage, yet still new player friendly by equalizing most of them out in the end. Where WarCraft really shines though are the units in which each faction can produce. They all are unique, yet still remain to be the same. One example are the basic units of each race. Footmen are the middle man of them all, normal health/attack/armor, and can defend against ranged attacks. The orc unit, the grunt, is a powerhouse with more health and attack then the footman, but costs more to build and have less armor. Ghouls for the undead harvest lumber, so you have to balance them between your attack force and resources. They also attack faster then the other counterparts, but have a lower health/attack/armor. The Night Elf unit, the archer, is a ranged unit, and is very much like the footman except for in that area. These counter carry throughout the tech trees, showing no true overpowered race that every player chooses. The story line is one almost out of a book, and is executed in a brilliant manner through the eyes of each faction. WarCraft has withstood the test of time, and is still played worldwide through battlenet, and will continue to be.One of the best multiplayer real-time strategies; almost perfectly balanced, including four different, but competitive races. Although the plot of the solo campaign is a little bit childish, we have to remember, that in fact it\\'s just a guide, that\\'s very helpful for beginners, that want to make their first steps on battle.net.When I first saw the game in 2002, i was fell in love with it, and became a die hard fan of warcraft universe. I play it today, and i dont even feel im playing a 9 year old game, the graphics are still very good. If you havent played it yet, do it now when the online community is still alive, but honestly i dont see it go anywhere anytime soon. Also the map editor is best one i ever saw in any game, EVER. You can technically make your own game in it, and thats what people do. Only flaw of it i can come up with is that custom games are hosted peer to peer, if you dont have an external IP, you cant host. But that doesnt stand in the way of making it best RTS of all time.Amazing story and singleplayer, if you have WoW and havn\\'t played this, I HIGHLY recommend you pick this and Frozen Throne up.  This game lasted me several years because of the amazing amount of custom maps online.Hands down the best RTS game that has been made. Overall a very slickly produced game but the standout part of WCIII is it\\'s online play on Battle.net. The custom games available online are incredibly fun and have gone on to spawn whole genres of new games like DOTA 2 and LoL. Just a very accessible and fun RTS which hasn\\'t yet been surpassed.One of the best games ever made. Amazing graphics (for it\\'s time), music and sound 10/10, epic game play that only got deeper and deeper the more you played the game. Introducing RPG elements into an RTS game was brilliant. The characters and campaign mode were flawless and playing against people online was challenging and rewarding.Best game I have ever played and still play it frequently over a decade later. If only Blizzard would continue their RTS masterpieces. I recommend it to my friends but none will play since it is too aged.One of the best games ever.\\nMusic, cinematics, innovation gameplay with heroes, graphics, design, long singleplayer company, perfect multiplayer.Totally 10/10The company is boring, but if you play Onlan, then a completely different matter.The legendary game.Although generally I had no interests in RTS games, have to say warcraft III is kinda a game that even can get a role playing game fanatic like me into it. Cast absolutely all doubt aside that Blizzard might have lost its touch in games like diablo 3 and the new world of warcraft expansions, Warcraft III is an absolute good game. This game is far from being an RPG, but The light amount of RPG elements infused in the game are so appropriate since you will be spending a great deal of each campaign story with a given character and you would like them to grow somewhat between missions while you are still forced to rebuild the rest of your base and those character focus story-telling through the campaign helped so much to build something really great to the end. Yet WAR III is essentially an online game, but I really do not find the online match that frustrated like starcraft, because other than building a base and army, the hero can be a very key role in the game match. Also in the game mod called DOTA, you can only play as just a hero to against each other which is really a very good online competitive experience.Dear Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos,\\nI will miss you. Blizzard has destroyed you with the release of Reforged but I will forever remember you as the masterpiece that you were. One of the greatest games of all time. Seventeen year legacy. RIP.This was such an awesome game. The story is compelling, the gameplay addictive. I thought they would make warcraft 4 after WoW, sadly they never did.With its expansion Frozen Throne, this is the last project from Blizzard before Activision’s acquirement and the only-online + multiplatform policies that leave us pure casual online cash grab. If you like the innovative blending with RPG, you will love it, and if not you should at least recognize its polished gameplay and sheer amount of detail in each pixel, not mentioning its contribution, creating entire genres as the popular mobas or tower defense from user made maps. It is the last 100% Blizzard product.Incredible game, incredible story. Humorous while at the same time tragic and heartbreaking. Warcraft at its RPG best. Do not miss this one. Even fifteen years later it shines on.Best strategy game that has ever been made even if it is flawed so if you haven\\'t already play it and play itThe best game ever,  with immersive single player and an epic multiplayer.\\nThis game marked my childhood. Thanks Blizzard for this masterpiece.\\nsimply AWESOME!!!It\\'s a very good video game!\\nIt\\'s a very good video game!\\nIt\\'s a very good video game!best warcraft game   his bases still persist\\nthe lord of the rings of the gamesIt has one of the best scripts in the history of video games. It is also one of the best in the genre and inspired later games.\\n\\nGreat graphics for the time, great character design, innovative, a masterpiece.july 3rd, 2002- january 28th, 2020. wc3 reforged has killed this masterpiece as they forced everyone that owned this game and who wanted to play online to download a 30 gb update and install wc3 reforged as blizzard took the lazy way out and just added a old graphics option and called it \"classic\"Strategy for all times, and most importantly, with a cool plot and a huge world of gameThe best strategy in real time that I played, and the game that had the greatest influence on me.Sorry for Blizard, she was killed recently by releasing the Press F to Pay Respects reform.Damn, sometimes you really only appreciate something after it’s gone. If I knew reforged would come to kill it I’d have played even more.This game is like conor mcgregor. the best thing in the world and no one can forget his legacy!Another example of a perfect story, perfect gameplay and perfection itself...This game is the best strategy game I played (and I hate strategy games), not only has an excellent story, a very good and sticky voice acting, good graphics for the time, and a very simple gameplay, ifNot that you have a lot of strategies that you can think.This game possesses everything, difficulty, good and catching story, has everything that a good strategy game should have, I really recommend it.Excellent pc game. The best i\\'ve ever play period.One word.... simply awesome.This game is fantastic the orcs desing the creeps the N.buildings the new civs this is progress and the night elves those are the best.Alright, but not even close to the fun of WC2.Quite possibly the best real time strategy game ever made! It beats out StarCraft, it beats out both Diablos, it beats out everything.Anything less than a 10 would be an insult to this icon of true RTS gaming greatness. Turning it into WoW and MMOifying the story is one of gaming greatest blasphemies in gaming history.This is a BOMB! How the heck can people vote it 8 - 9 ??? This kinda the mother who gave birth to the very original RPG elements. You can still pick it up today and call it a master peace. This game is the mother of the qurrent RPB games we have today.Classic and one of the best RTS games. The story is great written, I am sure I am not the only one, that wanted to see the next cinematic. There are 4 races with 4 campaings and own heroes. Great.\\nThe graphics was and is crap, especially that your view is too much zoomed in. There is a hack that can change that. I played many online games, because battle.net is the best online game portal.The times when Blizzard were the gods of the industry.This is something at the level of the most famous fantasy of the universes, only cooler.Everything is cooler when you turn from the viewer into a participant.Likely Blizzard\\'s magnum opus, Warcraft III manages to pack a ridiculous amount of content into one game. The graphics have aged well, and the game still maintains its fantasy aesthetic well. The recent updates to the game have enhanced this experience for many current players, who seem loyal and unwavering to this title all these years later. To put it into perspective, Warcraft III introduces many of the most well-known characters in their entire brand in one story mode. The single player presented here is near unrivaled for its genre, and the multiplayer, map editor, and custom community mods are just as great. Games like Dota, League, Heroes all exist because of the creativity of the creators and users. While, the creations have ceased to a halt, many multiplayer game modes such as Hero Wars, X Hero Seige, and Fight of the Characters are still an absolute blast after the initial learning curve. I can imagine that playing with a group of friends, these modes can bring a G-Mod-esq experience and one that I would highly recommend. Additionally, Warcraft III contains a story mode that has around 7-8 main characters Blizzard\\'s writing and worldbuilding are in top form, with numerous twists and turns as you play through the eyes of all 4 races. Each race contains 3 heroes (4 with the expansion) and differing playstyles that give each race a satisfyingly different playstyle. The concept of heroes (Superpowered units) battling with their armies adds a unique experience and one that hasn’t been replicated 16 years after its release. Overall this remains as the groundwork for one of the greatest selling mmos of all time and it absolutely shows.Warcraft 3 is one of the best RTS games ever made. This is the game that really expanded the warcraft universe and presented the rich lore that would lay the foundations for the popular MMO World of Warcraft. Warcraft came out a time when they still made physical manuals for the games. The manual itself is more than just a manual. Its a tome of knowledge that gives you detailed lore.\\n\\nReing of Chaos also marked when the series truly came into its own. It introduced 2 new playable factions in the form of the Nightelves and Undead. The graphics were updated to full 3D polygonal models and featured cutscenes and voiced dialogue between missions which progressed the story.\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar you assume control of one of the four aforementioned races and in typical RTS fashion build bases and units and research upgrades. To do so you harvest gold and lumber as your primary resources. As your army grows you enter upkeep where you need more and more resources. This calls for expansion and building second bases. Its a delicate balance you have to walk. Expand too soon and you likely won\\'t have enough units to fend off enemy attacks. Wait to expand too long and your enemy may prove to be too difficult to deal with as you spend more gold to replenish your lost troops. Your gold and lumber aren\\'t infinite. Each race has certain advantages when it comes to the economic aspect of the game. Humans can assign more than one builder to a structure to shorten build times at the cost of more resources. Nightelves can summon or grow structures by using wisps. These wisps also can harvest lumber without needing to return it to the base by hand Undead can haunt gold mines.\\n\\nIts these nuanced differences that make each faction interesting to play. There are also creeps around the map that you can kill to level your heroes which can use items like scrolls and more to enhance their abilities they earn as they level up.\\n\\nBeyond the single player the game also offers multiplayer as well as the utilities to make your own maps and scenarios. Its this feature that gave rise to the MOBA\\'s we have today like LoL, Dota II and even Heroes of the Storm. If you saw the Warcraft movie or want to learn more about the lore, this is a great starting point.One of the best strategies, one of the best games in general.\\nAn interesting plot, the gameplay is just a bomb, and the atmosphere is 10/10.\\nThere will be no more similar games.Be sure to play if you haven\\'t done it yet.Possibly the best game ever made. It\\'s map editor spawned a whole genre of games, from tower defense to MOBA\\'s. The single player campaign, like the characters was immense. The whole game oozes creativity and intelligence. If you haven\\'t went on a murderous rampage with Blade Master against villagers/whisps/Peons/Acolytes early in a game then you haven\\'t lived. Epic.At the height of popularity of the RTS genre, Warcraft III delivered something so polished and complete that it could be the only videogame in your library at that time and you would still be considered a gamer. This game has something to hook almost every type of person. It was smaller issues, mostly relevant to competitive play, that kept Warcraft III away from it\\'s perfection. It delivers in every other angle. There\\'s story, there\\'s design, there\\'s music, there\\'s even one of the most complete and powerful modding engines. Blizzard never planned this game to have a ending, and some are still playing it.Bought this game on the day it came out and i still play it occasionally today (2016). This should already say it all. Back then it set a new standard in RTS and build up the story for World of Warcraft. This game is an all time classic and probably among the best of its genre.\\nThe vast variety of fun maps created by the fans (the original DOTA, as the most famous one) kept this game alive for far beyond its designated life span. One of my all time favourites...All you have to say is: Warcraft.And Blizzard.And the chocapic is ready.Blizzard has formed a universe with Warraft that determined my childhood and still gives me nostalgic moments.Literally the game of a life. Even in its basic form by which i mean the campaign and normal games against ai this game is great. The story and cinematics allow the player to dive into the Warcraft universe, discover it and ultimately fall in love with it. The game is still playable after 15 years since its birth, mainly due to map editor which allowed to create astounding number of different mods that keep entertaining people to this day and even brought moba genre to life. To this day none other game gave me that much entertainment and fun while playing with friends as this one. Because of maps variety almost everyone can find something for himself, its far more than a strategic game now and for me, the best game ever created.The truth is that this game is already its years, but the truth is that it stays well.\\nThe story is very, very good, the graphics are good, the soundtrack good ... do not pay much attention haha\\nBut the gameplay was the typical role -playing game, of the time where you built your \"city\" to create your battle or material collection units.It has a great story with different playable characters and is one of best developed strategy games. It\\'s somehow like age of empires but it\\'s more unpredictable.Best Rts ever... Hands down\\nHas amazing story with amazing characters, amazing gameplay\\nRpg and strategy elemts make very consistent unity\\nWhat else can u expect from game ?I never liked RTS genre too much but Warcraft 3 was something special. And the best part of it is flexible map editor that allowed players to create unique scenarios varying from puzzles and adventures to online PvP arenas.In the game is perfect everything. It is graphic, gameplay, campaign, multiplayerI\\'ve played this game many years ago. But it\\'s the best game of my childhood.Classic. Just classic. No more words. Unique world, breathtaking storytelling and dynamic gameplayThe best game of all time and peoples who do not agree - he does not understand anything in games at all.Zase práce, co mám udělat?  Legendary czech dabing, characters and story. This is what created WoW. I love lore of W3.\\n\\nBest RTS strategy of all time no doubt.Great and fun game. Many hours, days and weeks of fun. Amazing story with fantastic campaigns with all four playable races. Orc, Human, Undead and Night Elf. Awesome cinematics. Outstanding heroes from Thrall and Jaina to my all-time favorite the gorgeous and beautiful Tyrande.\\n\\nIn Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal my favorite race was of course the orcs because you know everyone knows what humans look like. Now I have a new favorite race...that\\'s the Night Elves and it\\'s been since 2003 now.Short reviews!\\nThe good:\\n- Setting\\n- Lore\\n- Story\\n- Gameplay\\n- AI\\n- Replayability\\n- Soundtrack\\n- Various buildings and units\\nThe bad:\\n- Ehmm...\\n\\nSummary: Well, it\\'s an immortal classic so I won\\'t add nothing new. You all have to play it!Childhood game.Although I don’t really remember the plot, but what exactly I remember, he was good.I played little in Reign of Chaos so I can’t really say.Best game ever. Hundreds of hours spent on it and now, due to Reforged is no longer availableThis is one of the best games EVER made, the amount of new games this game has spawned is mind blowing, too bad the new Blizzard will never live up to the greatness the company was built on. Backup your 1.31 versions of this beloved game, cause new Blizzard is out to behead it!Best game ever, played it for over 10 years still far way better than games nowadays.... Sadly it\\'s now gone.... gone with the old Blizzard we once familiar with.....… ExpandThis is AWESOME RTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved this game >\\n1) Custom maps\\n2) Interesting campaning\\n3) Great Sound !\\n4) Great Music!\\n5) Classic Lore!\\n6) Teatral Sound SFX!\\n7) Good History!It\\'s probably the best RPG in the history of video games with only Starcraft:broodwar being relatively close.\\n\\nThe art was completely beautiful for the year it came out and it\\'s still visually cool nowadays. The campaign is simply godlike. Very interesting lore, characters, story, music, everything. The multiplayer is crazy good. The introduction of the enhanced battle.net was amazing, the icons, the match-making, simply perfect, it\\'s even better than the current battle.net 2.0 blizzard is using except ping-wise.\\n\\nIn general it\\'s just the best RTS you can play.The graphics is best and still among popular RTS game. But I don\\'t think this game is prefect (even Age Of Empire II is not prefect). Because I don\\'t like the unit sounds and the Enemy AI. But you can called it \"most popular RTS all-times\".Reforged destroyed the game - how could you do this to a fifteen year legacy.Ever since I have bought this game, I have never put it down. Until today this game still takes up a majority of my playtime, along with Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne and Hearthstone.Prehaps the most impressive real time strategy game ever made. The shear amount of quality and polish is almost overwhelming. Like the movie Aliens, it\\'s an example of how brilliantly entertaining something can be, if it does its thing well. In this case that would be too build a base, train units and completely obliterate your enemy using a variety of very colourful and explosive spells. Good stuff!Redundant and uninspired. Warcraft 2 and, particularly, StarCraft are far more competent games.Just the same old, dull, stupid formula rehashed, with ugly 3D graphics. If you\\'ve played WC2 all the way to the end, there\\'s no real reason to bother with this one.I loved Warcraft II, but couldn\\'tHey there, hey there. RTS? RPG? MMORPG? Got milk? No seriously, Warcraft 2 was a game I played a lot in my childhood. It was always the second choice after Doom (1,2,ultimate). After a while, I realised Warcraft 2 was getting dull and empty. Like beating a can with a stick. All I found really worthwhile were the sounds. \"DA\\'BURR!\" Y\\'know? Wacraft 3... Well, it\\'s the sequel, with revamped graphics, new engine, new everything, really. The game\\'s pretty, let\\'s admit that. The characters look cartoonish and they have always looked that way in the Warcraft series. Removing the ultra-pwnage of getting the biggest and baddest creatures in the game to win it all, WC3 forces you to use heroes. Rather than spam your mines with 20 peasants, you can just use a few in other races. The whole story kind of goes \"PFOOT!\" after a while. Everything goes predictable in a LOTR kind of way. Multiplayer? I\\'ll admit, I\\'m more of a single-player person for those games. But on multi-player, I found the same recipee as for all the other Blizzard games. You know specific strategies for each race, you win it all. There isn\\'t much room for innovation, because everyone has done it. Trying to stray from the main track gets you losses. How fun?I\\'ve been playing this game since 2002/2003 but Blizzard ruined it with the reforged update. Stay away now.This game is flat out bad. Multiplayer is the same rushing sh*t from StarCraft only with out the zerglings. The supposed \\'balance\\' is simply a glorified version of rock, paper, scissors. The single player while having a decent story line is a drawn out, pain in the ass. Do not buy this game. Buying it tells Blizzard that they can make money by producing inferior games.Game crashed my computer after new patch. Great job guys. You destroyed the game ive played and loved all my lifeIt\\'s a pretty weak game. The AI is terrible and is obviously breaking the rules. Plus it\\'s not much fun when the computer gets four fully built bases while you get one base which is horribly placed.I dislike this game because there is no vaerity in the teams&units, and there is only one difficuty of AI and the campaign didnt go on for very long:( yet the graphics and mutliplayer are good and fast. still at times the graphics can be confusing in combat.At first i thought this game was cool, because it was about warcraft. I played world of warcraft before it, so i wanted to play this. What a big mistake that was. The characters look completely cartoonish and can be compared to fisher price people. The idea of upgrading your buildings and troops seems cool at first, but it later gets annoying and you keep forgetting about it. On most maps you start off with about 10 people while the enemy has about 4 bases. The biggest armies consist of 16 people, making it feel more like a scouting party than an army. At first i liked the idea of heroes, but after a while you seem to use them for everything because they are way too powerful. They are basically the equvillant of 15 people, so you can defend your whole base with him and 5 people. The idea of needing air units to attack air units is also dumb. The average building can produce 1 or 2 types of troops, so you have to keep switching between buildings to produce different types of troops. Altogether it feels like 100 pots boiling at the same time. The only good part is the story. Its hard to make a strategy game that has bad graphics, gameplay, objectives, army sizes, and unbalanced characters all at once, but warcraft 3 rises to the challenge.It seems repetitive and boring, the only good thing about this warcraft compared to the earlier 2 are the graphics, which aren\\'t even stunning.Best story line with the expansion in a RTS game and in all Warcraft games.\\nVery nice missions. 4 different races. One of the best RTS games with Starcraft, Red Alert II, Command & Conquer generals and Dungeon Keeper II\\nless : graphics, build in pvp\\nGame play : 7/10, graphics : 4/10, back ground : 8/10, lifetime : 6/10, sound : 7/10Probably the best RTS I have ever played. I like how Blizzard tells the story, how makes the gameplay, how creates the soundtrack. Overall, the game features great 4 campaigns, cool multiplayer, and you can play with bots as well. This is definitely masterpiece.Fix this ass game. If a human god (lyking) says it needs fixing then you know they did something wrong. Why are you allowing a tier 1 unit to counter a tier 3? Is Blizzard retarded?I for one never liked reign of chaos, the story is slow and a chore to play, its really just one long tutorial, you get units after every few levels and get accustomed to using them, every few sequence just shows how some units joined certain factions and so on, but when you do get around to actually understanding the story its wonderful, but it has huge plotholes and missed opportunities. The artstyle is GREAT, really good stuff that only reflection can make you realize, the cinematics are flawless. The gameplay is a real step up from War2 but my God is the hero system janked. This game has a huge learning curve, better be ready to grind those how-to videos and practice over and over till you finally git gud, the enemy AI cheats in custom game, its collection rate and training time is better than yours, but with enough strategy you can win.legend    /    /Deep and competitive real time strategy, complemented by brilliant artwork and an epic saga like no other.Games Out of Politics, games outside of politics, Jogos Fora da PoliticsGENERAL.I would like to apologise to Warcraft 3 for taking this long to finally go out and buy it. 3 years after it\\'s release, I finally decided to give it a whirl. 3 years wasted...Probably the best game I have ever played.Even after years of playing this game it is still fun. This game looks really great with good animation and character sounds. Each character has a specific voice. The sound is well done overall. The gameplay is one of the best in RTS history up to date. There are so many strategies. You can\\'t just do one strat and expect to win all the time. On Battle.net it gets real competitive. The multiplayer is very good and well done. The single player is one of the best of any game i\\'ve played. It has amazing cutscenes and sucks you in. It has an amazing story which will keep you enthralled throughout the whole game. The single player really gets hard after a the first few missions. Blizzard puts great effort into all their games. I have yet to find a Blizzard game I\\'m NOT satisfied with.U must have this freakin best game ever!!! i can\\'t wait for world of warcraft!!!I love Warcraft II and am currently still addicted to it so when the third one got released I almost sh*t my pants and am playing it almost 24/7!It\\'s a progressive score.. i\\'ve only played thru the two training missions and the first two missions of the (single-player) human campaign and it looks very promising. my only slight criticism would be that you cant pull the camera back far enough.I really like this game. Great story, great multiplayer, great graphics, it has everything!!!It is the best game ever!!!',\n",
       " 'Counter-strike(1.0 - 1.6 not source) is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does...After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can\\'t be ignored. No other shooter is as accessible, easy to play, simple nor skillful as this. It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties. It\\'s all about aim, accuracy, quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and there\\'s no respawning. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.One of the best games of all time... Never forget the great times on this game! Miss it so much! If the Aus servers were still up and full, I would still be crankin out this classic. Source was a massive step backwards.The greatest multiplayer shooter experience I\\'ve had since Quake 1. The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it\\'s the only computer game I\\'ve really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The CoD and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.I am playing Counter-Strike for 4 years, I have got played 1750 hours and I love this game. This game is number 1. on the wold and will never disappear.The year was 2000. Half-Life had already taken the world by storm and the prospect of modding the game was increasing in popularity. Counter-Strike was one of those mods. One of the most popular game modifications ever, Counter-Strike blended chunky weapons with rewarding teamplay, with the goal for counter-terrorists in most of the maps to either defuse a bomb, rescue hostages, escort a VIP to safety or prevent the terrorist team from escaping the area they\\'re in. If you\\'re on the terrorist team, however, the team goals are the opposite, naturally. One of the things that shines about Counter-Strike, though, is the amount of possibilities available. Don\\'t feel like storming the enemy base guns-blazing? Why not sneak in via an air vent directly connecting to the room that the hostages are being contained in? Or perhaps you could draw your enemis out then snipe them from a distance? All the different ways you can win the match is ground-breaking. This, along with crisp, timeless graphics, a great selection of guns and the need for true teamwork, make Counter-Strike one of the best games of the decade.Counter-Strike is not just the best FPS ever made, this is the best game ever made.  Bar none.  This game took up more of my High-School hours than all other games combined.  I played in tournaments for this game where 2,000 people showed up - had local clans for this game - smoked with a national championship team for this game.Counter-Strike launched the real frenzy into online multiplayer FPS - no other FPS had as many players at once, and at the time, this was the #1 most played online game.  It held that title for YEARS.This is one of the best, most influential, and most copied games of all time.  It will never get better than what this was, at the time.By far, leagues beyond any other competitive online game made. This set the standard for every game to come in terms of competitive gaming. There\\'s a reason why so many people gave up on CS:Source. 1.6 is the most perfect game ever made. Hopefully CS:GO doesn\\'t **** it up.Best MOD for Half-Life. This game has the best multiplayer you have played (the problem is the damn LAG) and a very simple plot that is police and terrorists. Definitely the best game of VALVEVERY WELL PROGRAMMED GAME! I have just started and heave never left my computer since day 1, very addictive game and best way to release anger on people over the world!Theres nothing compared to this.. its extreme!Best game ever, very addictive played since early 2000 thanks to some friends still hoooked onto it but not a 24/7 player :P but im pro :P kekek lah!!\\n\\nGO australian cs :P lol \\nThats the only game i play on my computer praactically :P becoz i dont have the time to play other games... so counterstrike has made my fun time whenever i had some free time from my commitmments :DGameplay x Graphic Counter-Strike is the only one that several players worldwide can play by skill ... an average computer can run it .. and that\\'s the fun.The other games work as follows.The richest and the best PC that make the player play well, not skill ..

This game has led to a brief stint in running our own events, making new friends and finding people playing this game in my own town and even road! Never have I played a game that is so much more than just a game! Source is nowhere near as good as 1.6 if anyone from Valve/Steam is reading this, all you need to do to make Counter-Strike perfect is just do up 1.6 graphic wise, no fancy stuff and people will love it all over again!! The gameplay is just brilliant and you\\'ll play with different players from all over the country/world.Although old and basic this game is the most unique of all first person shooter games and has many hooked for life!The game is well known for leagues and lanning! I been to the majority of the following. CAL, OGL, CPL, WCG, ESL, XPL, ESEA, CEVO, LAN Tourny and more. This game relies on skill, fast reaction, and good hearing.

Especially as you do not need the best of computers to run it makes it a game for everyone who likes shoot em ups which involve thinking instead of mindless slaying.10/10. The best online FPS of all time. The game is perhaps one of the greatest games to play competitively. Anyone should give it a try! I bought this in 2004 and I still play it, almost 8 years later.This game is one of the greatest fps ever (if not the greatest of all times) one game that is difficult to forget for every hour of fun and entertainment that I had playing it, back in the day,  when it came out pubs were full of people playing CS and out of them all people talking about it, about crazy things they did, about funny things that happened in the game... it was a craaaze, great times for sure great times long gone...\\n\\nWhat else can I say, this was the game that started everything for me. CS1.0-1.6, Go go go!A beacon of online gaming, that despite being a dated title, so many players come back to it because of the well defined game mechanic. There\\'s no great depth of content, just a simple yet enjoyable platform for team deathmatch, with map objectives thrown in. Years ago I spent at least 1,000 enjoyable hours playing it.Still in my memory as the best FPS multiplayer of all time. Hugely skill based. One death per round made it count. Still never experienced anything in any game like going on a real heater kill streak in good ol\\' CS!Nostalgic, along with Half-Life. Cutting edge for the time tho! Great multiplayer game with other players, first-person shooter, graphically similar to Half-Life with, across the time included assists from bots and scripts. I should repair my mistake, \"Cutting edge for that time tho!\".All time best shooter and most fun PC game ever. What make the game rock is the realism, the dynamism of the matches, the tactics and the graphics. Impact of this game no other PC game has ever caused since then.Amazing that the game after almost 20 years will continue to play, for its time (1999), which was a Mod de Half Life, it was very famous, a good fun shooter.I dedicate almost 500 hours to the XD game.This is a game you will never ever forget, even your dad\\'s grandfather\\'s sister\\'s uncle will enjoy this charm! Buy, download, install, play!Counter Strike 1.6 is the best game i have ever played.\\nI play my first time on a Atari and my opinion is there no beter then Counter Strike. The Gameplay makes realy fun but the only tho thinks i ever find not so good on this game is the graphic and the many cheaters in the game!!! thx to Siera !!!The best online FPS in gaming history. Other games like this are much worse than this masterpiece. You should absolutely try it out. If you love to shoot people or play in a great community, this is your game. Graphics is pretty old, but who cares about that... The only point in this game is you to be better and have fun. And these are guaranteed.I play CS 1.5/1.6 for over 4 years ... I\\'ve had my gambling time, but I\\'ve stopped many times, but as I always end up playing with full steam.The game is excellent, it is obvious that in the year we are (2006) the technology is much more advanced than before, so we can not compare current games with dear CS.Thank you Good morning everyonewtf counter strike the game of all games the game which revolutionized the fps market has 319 negative rewievs hu are these limy fuks giving cs a bellow 10 .

I was a 1.3 man myself always playing at an internet cafe so my experience was always playing with excellent ping in this game and usually in the company of at least one friend. The atmosphere was always an enjoyable one with this game and the thrill of playing against better players and winning was one of the best experiences I\\'ve ever had in all my years playing games. This game is the classic squad based competitive game with the best maps ever made.This game is legendary this should have 0 negative review\\'s those people are noobs on xbox DONT LISTEN this game is legendary the game of the century beutfiful i played 148 hours of it 636 hours of source and 100 minutes of condition zero (found by my steam time) but yeah source is my favorite CANT WAIT for CS:GO The Mod Creator\\'s Did AWESOME SO LEGENDARY BUY IT NOWGreatest FPS ever made, i still prefer CS Source, but i have to admit, this is THE ONE ! No other online shooter come close today, to find a game, you really have to look back at Quake 3 or Unreal.The most influential multiplayer FPS of all time. This game in 2012 was still in the top 3 played games every single week, 12 years after it\\'s release.  If that doesn\\'t say something then I don\\'t know what does.The best FPS and will remain the best forever. Released in 2000 and 15 years later still has active people on servers and is packed with fun gamemodes and maps! Tactical gameplay is magnificent, gameplay is fantastic. Graphics are not a problem because it means any operating system can run this game. I have been playing since 2007-8 and I am still an active player, my name on Steam is my username here.\\n\\nA great quote ai found from a meme---\"A game that looks good is impressive for a few months...but a game that plays well is impressive forever\".A masterpiece. It\\'s still getting mild support these days, they even introduced HD models and resolution upscaling. The formula revolutioned the FPS genre and made this the best Counter-Strike to date.Let me be clear that this 5 rating comes from an average of two specific things. As a game that (I believe) revolutionized the FPS and Multiplayer genre, it deserves a solid 10/10. It is a technical marvel, it plays flawlessly, and is insanely addictive. Once you own it you just keep coming back for more. It doesn\\'t matter what other games are out or will come out in the future, this title will stand out for a long time as the epitome of a perfect gaming experience. The average of a 5/10 comes from the other extent of my review which is a 0/10 for all the ridiculously annoying hackers that ruined the game for many many people. This game was so fun and entertaining until the hackers killed things for a good number of Counter Strike fans. That is all.A very awesome and challenging game,but when it comes to cheaters it really sucks.80% of the counter strike servers today are non-steam so you will find a bunch of 12 year old cheaters.Possible wait THE BEST MULTI FPS EVER CREATED UHHHHHHHHH 150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 chars150 charsExcelent multiplayer game, highly addictive, however still with lots of drawbacks - cheaters, too accurate weapons and players, and almost non-working armor, as well game when you can easly walk or run with sniper rifle and kill your oponents accuretly without recoil. It also have problem that maps are too small, and generally do not give you much of the freedom, in esence you cannot play a map more than one hour, as it will start being repetitive and boring. Also most of the fan-made maps are of very low quality. Other problem is that powerful weapons are too easly available, and revards and punishes quickly a worse players, makeing them even harder to kill anybody.This was fantastic for its time and was easily the best FPS out there. People still buy it and that\\'s because it is worth buying. (Although, watch out for the pro veterans who have played this game since it came out) 10/10This game is just classic. It basically invented the multiplayer first person shooters on the Pc. It\\'s a very fun game. People will be still talking about CS\\'s impact for years to come.When a mod becomes so popular that it outshines the game it was modded off of and spawns 2 sequels, you know it is an excellent mod. This game is fun for hundreds of hours, even in spite of the minor glitches. This game stands the test of time.This is my whole childhood. I played more than any other game, and still like to play it sometimes. I watched the competitions, and saw the amazing players (Spawn, cogu, etc) moves. It was amazing.I made my first PC because of this game. I made my second PC (2014) because of this game. BEST MP exp out there. cannot say enough about the fun, the mods, the mechanics of this game. It is simply perfect in the sense of getting good at anything [sports - skills otherwise]. I played CS 1.5 and was ADDICTED, and built a PC after xbox 360 got me back into gaming after my old PC failed (hence the 360 :P). CS is still and will continue to be the best game i have ever played to date. The mods, the beyond amazing times ive had with friends, it just never ends... I TRULY wish that more people would play this game because of its unbelievable sport, its comradery. ITS FUN!!. Try it, get good at it, invite some friends, if you tell me its bad I will call you a bold faced LIAR!!!!! Next gen anything cant compete with this!shel be there;)\\n====================\\nAfter all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can\\'t be ignored.

Thats why id have to rate it quite low ;).I don\\'t understand why Counter-strike is so popular. I loved every Valve game to date, except counter-strike. I played Team fortress classic when Counter-strike was so popular. Recently I decided to buy it from steam. I found it bland, boring and repetative. Always the same: plant the bomb shoot the counter-terrorists, win/lose. I\\'m a tolerant man but I can\\'t stand counter-strikes blurry textures. Bottom line: I may be the olny one but I don\\'t care for Counter-strike!boring game, includes too much cheaters, and everybody play that stupid boring de_dust2.This game is a bullshit. the hitboxes are shit easy to make a headshot. BUY COUNTER-STRIKE: SOURCE!!!Have never seen more suckier game than this. The only reason people are playing this is that it\\'s easy to learn and even the nerds with an IQ of a fly could learn to play it. So all the gamers out there who don\\'t have the brain for a bit more challenging game, go and give CS a try.This game started out amazing, but over the years you come to realise that its just too repetitive! Same thing over and over, with added cheaters. I would suggest playing some Team Fortress Classic.\"This is a poor game. It was built 8 years ago, and is meant for 8 years ago. Nowadays there are lots of better games available, with much more realistic graphics, gameplay, and whatever you can imagine. In this game you can not only headshot someone without aiming with AWP, you can also shoot trough 99% of the walls. So if you want to win, just shoot against all walls. Graphics quality is as low as it can be, and gameplay sucks as much.\"Absolutely terrible gameplay, very monotonous.I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy.Nice idea and teamplay. But the gameplay is very slow and sticky. The engine is much too old today and the graphics are very plain and simple. Especially this is a hard contrast to temporary new games.For what it does, it\\'s a great game; problem is, it doesn\\'t do much. Very solid, fast-paced gameplay, good graphics for the engine (bad in comparison to modern games, but whatev). As a realism FPS/ strategy gamer, CS is way too simple and repetitive for me. While the skill gap between new players and pro players is huge, all that seperates these players is their twitch reaction speeds. I\\'ve shot handguns and assault rifles for a while now, and a *very* minor thing that bugs me in CS is how your av hold left handed guns in his right hand, and right handed ones in his left (so that the brass ejects across your body, towards your eyes...hot brass stings like shit when it hits your eyelid). If you like simpler, faster paced games, you\\'ll love CS. It\\'s very solid (few glitches, movement/shooting/gameplay meshes great) and hackers, while much more apparent than in other games, aren\\'t much of a bother; if one joins the server, find another server to play in. Deserves a 6 because despite what anyone else here says, it\\'s very repetitive and does not take much skill other than being fast with your crosshairs. Just not my cup of tea.ya i play cz and i wanted to say that u shouldbe able to hit people with ur gun in stead of pulling out your knife and that takes like 4 seconds and i think the hit box is off like when u shoot at a afk is so off u cant even hit in the head some times u should fix that please.I understand that people like it i play\\'d it 5 years but now i don\\'t like it anymore .\\nI say \"start with girl then you will get tired of it there are much cooler things then gaming\" .\\nFreaking on a game is not good for your social life.\\nSow all get a life ;P .\\nI give it 5/10 because i fucked up 5 years of mine life ! Thx ! ;P muahaha ;DIf Steam had \"locked\" the cfg so just  rates could be changed  it had been a 10*    but i see scriptcheaters and illegal cfg hacks everytime i play, and the damn kids just says: the game is made that way to hack the cfg..........where is the moral? i can`t understand how people can sit and play and think that they are good when it is only their cfg hacks that is good. And why dont they work harder with anticheat?  i think they like the cheating and bust them couse they earn money thou the cheaters just buy a new account for about 12 dollars......it is all about the money or where is the logics? 3 lines in the cfg and u got almost wallhack, or how fun is it with people that have white walls and neonred skins on the enemy, and talk about that sound hack where u can hear  wich way the enemy runs from their spawn......I give him(her) this punctuation. I do not give him(her) 10 because it(he,she) has bad(wrong) graphs in any sides, and it does not please me of the multi-player\\'s video games. But only because of it, the majority of the game is excellent. But what happens(passes) is that there are to some servers that appear and have a great ping, and is too much. Sera because we are from another Country? Because they have told my me that if you belong to another country and another player to other one, one will have a high ping and other one a low ping. It is the only(unique) thing that it is necessary to arrange in this game and serious perfectly. This one is my commentary. =) Look, this use a traductor: Spanish to English xDThe game is an okay FPS game for ppl wh wants some action but it is old and cheating is getting even worse than when i started in beta..\\nCheating in this game is something everyone should try for a few days or so, but its actualley making you even worse than you were in the begging. I was number 2 in denmark for ablut 5months, and i must say that the game have become to easy to cheat in.. Doesent seem that anyone cares anymore?\\nBut all in all the game is something you must experince if you\\'re into FPS games like most of ppl.\\nGood game. Have fun playing\\nMrT over and outInteresting game that trys at a recreating modern realistic SWAT team like gun action. While remaining some degree of realism to the average player, a real look at the mechanics of the game reveals many unrealistic points which can be exploited by better players. In the end the attempt at realism does little more than make that game slow and somewhat boring compared to it comtemporaries like Team Fortress and HL deathmatch. This attempted realism, combined with having to wait in spectator mode after you die until another round starts, makes the game almost unplayable to those who love the fast action of more Quake-like fighting.WORST GAME EVER! I\\'ve been around mroe than the block for gaming and this game seriously is the worst I\\'ve played. Firstly, why the hell would you want to simulate real life?! This is actually THE least imaginitve game in history as far as i can tell. The makers must\\'ve just looked at the world and said \"Ha, hey guys! Check out how much reality sucks! Let us inflict this thought on others\".. well maybe not quite that but this sorta thing just isn\\'t meant to be made unless as a joke. Thankfully the game is easy enough to mod, sometimes just by novelty maps so that part gets a thumbs up. FACE!Best game i have ever played.I was addicted to this game.But i will now tell everyone i know to never buy thisgame. Because my account has gotten hacked 3 times and i havent had any viruses on my computer and i nver gave away my steam account. I have messaged steam numerous times asking to have my account back and they have yet to recieve a email to atleast help me to get it back. Other than that, the game is great but filled with hackers.\"This is a poor game. It was built 8 years ago, and is meant for 8 years ago.

Graphics quality is as low as it can be, and gameplay sucks as much.\"I don\\'t like this game because is mor servers with cheaters Is very bulnerabiliti at cheat apps sory for my bad English.This game was super somedays... But no every time i play it, i end after 15 minutes because its so boring now. All over and over agin. Its just waste of time playing it now. And the other thing is that this game plays so many kids under 16yr and servers are full of players like 10 year old screaming and doing some horrible things all over the map.Valve is a great compeny and they can make great games. But, VAC (valve anti cheat) isnt so that good. I think cs should merge with css\\'s grafix and make a cs1.6:source. That may you can have the fun of the game w.o the bad grafix. Any way, Great game!This is the greatest game to ever bring people together on the net. The social aspect brings me back day after day. However, as an admin on our server, we are constantly banning cheaters. The level of cheating has risen to where it is very difficult to detect at first, but with constant specing, wallers and togglers can be deetected. Due to the inability of steam to prevent hackers from destroying the even playing field, I rated the game an over all 3.Good game and it could probably be much better but the kind of people you met while playing turned me off big time. I did enjoy playing it when it was relevant.Its fun but at the end its all the same its simple shooter game if you like medal of honor you like this. If  you like Quake or unreal tournament you don`t like this. Its a base round game. For me it was little fun but cheaters and aim-bots take over the game. Even with protection the problem is cheating wall-hacking and that kind of nasty things. If you can manage to ignore it have fun :)… ExpandCounter Strike is the best shooting game, i\\'ve ever played. The \\'real cs\\', where you plant bombs etc. is not 10/10 gaming, but look at all those great mods! The greatest thing in cs is playing mod servers, and you do not need to download them from your web, you just simply double click that server, and that\\'s it! At first I recommend to play normal cs, if it gets boring try other servers. Oh and original maps aren\\'t that great, except de_dust2. You must try cs even if you think it has low graphics. Gameplay is much more important than graphics, remember that!No doubt, Counter Strike is one of the best multiplayer shooters ever, but it haves two problems. First, it haves so much cheaters in the game, that always playing with annoying cheaters is frustrating. And the second one is the enemy AI when you play with bots, it is stupid that you will laugh watching bots playing. Despite from those problems, Counter Strike is great and addictive. 81 out of 100the graphics are horrible but the game is very good. Sample, repetitive and addictive. the perfect formula to create one of the best FPS in the world.10/10\\n\\nThis game has so many features, To Mods, To gameplay changes, For a game of its time, it has so many great things going for it. The game is still really good and very popular. Ive probably put more hours in this game then any game ive ever played. And thats saying alot as much as i get bored\\n\\nIf you get past the older graphics. Its actually a very nice starter FPSIt is the best online fps game in the world E.E, if telling that it has a long history of success from the premiere of Half Life and Counter Strike is the best modMiami isn\\'t on here  but thats an obvious reason to give this xbox live rip off a 1.0 get yourself the real deal for Xbox on Ebay for 99Cents, Xbox live version rules  the PC versionIt was and probably is still a great game, however, nowadays, the game is full of bugs, and most online servers want to hack your configuration files so you can\\'t play on any other server than theirs.\\n\\nStill, it is THE game if you are looking for some old-school LAN action with your friends at home, or just a little bit of fun at work.An Half Life mod from Minh Le that ended up as an FPS classic. That conquered hearts of millions of gamers. For its simplicity and replayability. Not to mention some of the most balanced maps that are easy to remember and learn. And people still play competitive matches. Its like an Phoenix that cant die.During it\\'s time, it was by far the best Team FPS game with a very popular and successful eSports following. Even after a decade since its release, it is still a mechanically smooth game.This game would have to be THE best game I have ever played.\\nI have been playing this game for 11 years now and still cant get enough of it.\\nEverytime I play on a server, I cant help but remember the good old days back in 2006 when there were so many servers/game types to choose from, alongside a huge community with all the fun and laughs involved with people you met in-game.\\nEven though there arent as many servers around today and people playing this game online have lessened, the game is still equally as fun and competitive.\\nPeople trash talking you just tend to ignore, others become really fun to play against as you will find yourself constantly in sessions with them and bettering your skills against people that are better than you.\\nIts one of those games where you will die countless times from people who have had much more experience than you and know everything for each map, but you just cannot hate on it.\\nYou will rage quit, but jump back on in 5 minutes.\\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes the fps genre (not including call of duty) as this game is far more competitive than so many shooters today so you probably wont last unless you explore classics.\\nThis game introduced me to online gaming and it has left so many good memories. I guarantee it will never be forgotten.\\n10/10 hands down.…Counter-Strike (1.0- 1.6) is specific game. This game requires skill, feel, team work and tactics. You\\'ll get skill with hours and hours of playing. I play this game long six years. On first look, I thought \"This game sucks!\" but game is awesome. Gameplay is reason why is this game specific. All these guys who gave score 1-4 are noobs who gave up. In this game I learned more things than in all games I was played. Believe me, don\\'t give up! I was a noob and everyone was making fun of me, but it\\'s just a step to be good player.Counter-Strike 1.6 will never die!Counter-strike give me a memorable and a great impression,i have been a main role in my whole game life.Until now,Counter-Strike Still give me a lot of fun!She is the King of FPS!It is one of the most common multiplayer games and manages to be really played today    .The next evolution in the first person genre. This game inspired Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and now every game wants to be a first person shooter because of this game\\'s success. Best damn shooter I\\'ve ever played in my life.One of the best counter-strike games(Or fps for that matter). It keeps it original simplicity with some additional new features.\\n\\nIf you love FPS games, this game should be in your library ASAP!This is probably the best fps games anyone can ever play. It began just as a Mod for the Half-life but it has proven itself more than enough as a standalone.Thanks for the contribution to the industry, but your time has passed.\\nThe game is outdated in all respects and only those people who are stuck in time or do not recognize modern games, as well as CS: go.It came out a lot of years ago and still remain popular. I remember being addictive with this game a few years ago, and I\\'m happy that I cancelled playing it since it took a lot of time. But I would definitely say that it is awesome. But not today.An attractive principle and a fairly amazing realistic approach in his time for team games that seem very friendly at the start, especially with friends ... Then we quickly realize that this mod only remains Bugs and the in-peu-près and whose results prove incredibly random ... in terms of frag or non-frag.\\n\\nThis is the problem when amateurs develop something or try to develop something: it remains at the best of amateur work and at worst a crap shit. The Counter is located depending on the case and situations (and the number of good lotto numbers) between the two. So suddenly, we camp a little too much, the others too, then it cheats, it exploits the multiple problems of what is not a game but an attempt that has never given anything ultimately ... even after patches , pseudo-suits and so on ...\\n\\nFinally, in terms of social relationships, it is a \"game\" rather to avoid: it puts the nerves in the ball and we get pissed in spectator mode; As for the \"online\" parts, there are only cheaters ... when it is not simply deserted. Definitively.Still one of the best games out there, 19 years since release and still has a big player base as most of games on steam.',\n",
       " 'Easily the single best FPS/RPG/Adventure hybrid, this game set the standard for next-generation RPGs a decade ago (a standard which, sadly, few have approached since). With gameplay mechanics that found the magic balance between player skill and character attributes, intricate-yet-accessible character customization (skills, augmentations, weapon customization, limited inventory forcing you to choose equipment suited to your play style), and a strong multi-linear (generally linear plot with multiple routes from start to 3 similar-but-narratively-distinct endings) story that invokes some of the most popular global conspiracy theories of the post-cold-war West, Deus Ex adapted the RPG genre to the FPS interactivity model in a way fans of both genres can appreciate (particularly impressive with respect to RPG fans). The graphics and audio (short loops for ambient sound, rudimentary environmental audio, short soundtrack) are dated, though well-implemented, and the AI scripting is more-or-less the 3-D version of Space Invaders AI (all guns blazing and weave as you CHARGE!), but even today the game is fun and engaging. In fact, despite having played through the story a dozen times or so, I\\'d gladly shell out another $50 for the same plot and mechanics on a contemporary rendering engine with slightly tweaked AI scripting; I\\'ve always wondered why the sequel(s? I haven\\'t checked-up on DX3 recently) decided to mess with a winning formula when they could have kept all of the mechanics and simply made new stories on next-gen engines. Anyway, I can\\'t recommend this highly enough.You know what should truly sell you on deus ex? Reading the negative reviews on metacritic. Then cross-compare them with the positive reviews. Then add a dash of common sense and ability to analyse and read between the lines. Now, onto the actual review. Deus ex - has been my favorite game for the past 12 years. And I play a lot of games. Why? It\\'s sure visually aged poorly, it\\'s kind of clunky. So surely that means I deduct a few  points right there? No. Deus ex is the true definition of a masterpiece, it gives you true options - options that the lesser masterpiece human revolution can\\'t even match. It still stands alone as something incredible - the only problem is that now people have to look past the age (if they are coming in fresh). Each hub (or sectioned level) offers hundreds possible \\'ways\\' to achieve a simple goal. Let me explain - It\\'s like this;  there is a simple thing you need to do. You need to infiltrate a building and get past all the guards in the building so you can download an important document (this is hypothetical). Now, there are about 10-15 different \\'ways\\' you can get into the building and each \\'way\\' has branching \\'options\\'. So options, lead to options, lead to options. You take choice 5 out of 15 and go through the sewers instead of the top, no strike that - you decide going above ground is best, so you get a crane and lower the shaft so you can sneak across onto the roof - no strike that, you decide to go full force and shoot everyone in your path - no strike that, you decide to go to the building manager and get a keypass, now when you open the caravan that the manager is in, it has cameras inside it, so you hack those cameras to work for you. You then threaten the manager with information you have on him, that you picked up off a nearby computer - then you walk past the guards and enter the keypass into the door slot. You walk strait in, and decide to open a vent that leads you to the roof, in which you plant explosives that might distract the guards. You walk up to the heavily guarded entrance to your objective - and you remotely detonate the explosive, all the guards run towards the threat and you walk into the room. Problem solved. Now, that thing you did was one of a few hundred things you could have done to achive that same 8 minute objective. Now you have 30 hours of incredible globe trotting, storytelling, twists turns, cities, exploration - all with that very level of freedom options. It\\'s mindblowing. That\\'s what you need to understand when you boot up deus ex and see some janky graphics and blocky models. No, this is not just \\'some first person shooter\\' dig deeper. And find one of the true miracles of gaming. This game needs a 999/10 score made specifically for it. Masterpiece is a painful understatement. This is a revolution in gaming that never took off. So far ahead of it\\'s time that nothing else can quite match it. I truly hope the developers of human revolution make another deus ex game - because I think they had the right idea. They did not \\'quite\\' pull off \\'deus ex\\'. But I have a feeling they are heading towards something great. And that\\'s promising.Best Game ever when you know that not even the people who made it, cannot even repeat the same level of genius that this game is. It is truly one of kind in terms of level design, story, atmosphere, characters and things that are not even seen in other games. Whenever somebody mentions the name of this game people reinstall it back onto their computers, but in my case I always keep it installed on my PC to remind me how amazing gaming can get.Admittedly, it is hard to go back and play Deus Ex these last few years. The game\\'s age has by far taken its toll on the experience. However, just because I outgrew the game does not mean it is worse than it was 10 years ago. With an overhauled GFX engine this game could easily make its way back into modern gaming libraries. The game had DEPTH! Excellent storyline, characters, and gameplay. I can admit that time gave deus ex a huge black eye, but before its gfx aged, it was a near perfect game.This game is excellent, simply put. Sure, it\\'s really hard, but all games of the time were. When you got a game then, it was all about the single player. If it were short and easy, like most current games are, then it wouldn\\'t have much substance and wouldn\\'t be much fun. The controls take literally a minute to change to modern FPS controls, so you can\\'t really complain about them. Unlike many current games, it actually has a decent story and good atmosphere. The game has aged surprisingly well over eleven years. To get an idea of what I mean, go back and play the original Half-Life. Amazing game, but looks so bad it\\'s almost impossible to play. The RPG elements are implemented really well, and any level-ups make an immediate difference in the game. While the inventory system is kind of a pain, it\\'s realistic and works well. There\\'s a reason this game is often hailed as the best PC game of all time: it\\'s excellent. If you don\\'t like it, you don\\'t know a good game when you play it!One of the best and arguably most important games for the PC.  Great story and gameplay that lets you choose either with stealth or brute force to complete missions.  Only problems I have with it is it\\'s ropey graphics (even at the time) and the weapons feel limp and lifeless.  This is the template for so many of today\\'s games.Dragon\\'s Tooth Sword FTW!The best game I have ever played. It got a great story, wonderful gameplay with multiple path choices and a lot of rpg elements from exploration xp to a great skill system. I have played it at least 4 times and today no game I have played or know about is even close in the enjoyment this game have given me.An experience in RPGs you can never forget. This game probably inspired most of the modern open ended RPGs. We can all thank this game for the great games of our generation.This is a classic for a reason: it\\'s a powerful game-play experience you won\\'t soon forget. Granted, it\\'s showing its age and it does take a commitment. It\\'s not a guns blazing FPS. But for those who want a thinking man\\'s FPS, this is it. Great characters, great environment, and great plot. Be sure to also download a few select Deus Ex mods for the best experience, such as New Vision, Shifter, Project HDTP, Deus Ex Enhanced, & Kentie\\'s Deus Exe. Seriously, just play this game. If you don\\'t like it, then you need to reevaluate your life.This game is amazing,its a futuristic cyber punk game where corporations and hidden groups controll the people in various ways,it suffers of an epidemic called gray death and the vaccine called \"Ambrosia\" cannot be delivered to anyone,riots wreck the streets,people are desperate for the vaccine.It mixes RPG with FPS perfectly,you can use lockpicking,computer skills,bypassing circuits,stealth,agression and secondary routes to complete your missions and objectives,on top of that,you get a prfect nano augmentantion system for you are a super advanced experiment that instead of using mechanical augmentations,uses this new pieces of technology,you can have various abilities this way.its only problem is that you might hafe to play it twice to get all the details of the plot or understand it because its a bit complicated.Deus Ex was something new. Something far outside the box. It took freedom of choice to a new level by breaking things down perfectly. It had incredible gameplay, incredible characters, and an unbeatable storyline. No game had ever done what Deus Ex did. It balances action, humor, suspense, and plot like no other to date.This game is so good it\\'s still regular makes the top ten best pc games of all time in various charts. It\\'s got everything. I only hope Deus Ex human evolution is half as good.I bought this game during summer camp 2011 on steam. Wow! It is 11 years old and it still so entertaining! There are so many things to do, to discover, to read, they thought about everything. It\\'s a must play, if you can handle low graphics (which were amazing for the time) you should enjoy a lot!Simply one of the best games ever created. Just finish Deus Ex:HR (prequel of Deus Ex) and will now start classic DX again :-) If thats your plan too: Make sure to use the new HighRes Package from http://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-new-visionTo Jared J. I\\'m assuming you\\'re aware that this game is nearly 9 years old and the chance of it running on a modern PC without serious glitches and faults is highly unlikely, yes? You might want to take that into account. Deus Ex is quite simply one of the greatest shooters of all time. The branching storyline, interesting characters, multitude of gameplay options and choices and the dystopian cyber-punk atmosphere are spectacular. Graphically dated, and probably not likely to run on a modern Vista setup without significant tweaking, but well worth the effort. If you like this, follow up with System Shock 2.Easily one of the best and most engrossing games on the PC. A classic!Best game ever....of all time. Well o.k. it is showing it\\'s age some but what an epic story! The graphics are of the era when just moving your jaw when you talked was cutting edge. Still, it has more content than any three modern games put together. The music was terrific and always matched the locales. The environments were varied and they offered multiple solutions to it\\'s sand-box style missions. My only complaint after twelve full play-troughs is that the inventory and crate-breaking got a bit tedious. The weapons were fun to use and the world seemed richly populated with characters that had their own stories. May we see more games like this again once the brown-shooter-dark-age is over.Deus Ex represents the apotheosis of video-game design. It has never been equalled, let alone surpassed, in this regard.\\n\\nTo understand Deus Ex requires an understanding of its pedigree. In the nineties, game design was beginning to fall into two different camps: the linear, tightly-controlled setup that could be seen in games like Doom and Quake, and in a more sophisticated fashion Half Life, and a more non-linear, experience-led approach. This latter approach was found in comparatively few games, as it was far costlier to make and typically resulted in far fewer sales. For these games, which were later dubbed the \"immersive simulators\" by Warren Spector, emergent gameplay was king. That meant that the game designer would not explicitly design the experience, but rather would let the player do things their way. Games like Ultima Underwolrd, Thief and System Shock would be the opening salvos of this style of gaming, all of which were popular and profitable, albeit not mega-successes. Deus Ex took things one stage further. As well as allowing most objectives to be completed in numerous different ways, map design was completely non-linear, and bizarre solutions to complex problems could be devised. Under attack in a penthouse apartment? Leap out of the window, break both your legs, and crawl away. Need to get past a laser defence grid, but can\\'t? Try smoking onto it, that\\'ll disrupt the beams. Need to stun two men to get past, but have no weapons? Use a fire extinguisher to blind them in the face. Need to infiltrate a guarded building? Reconnoitre it out, and look for a way in via the roof, or the sewers. Or try and bribe your way in. Need to get past a wall, but don\\'t want to fight the guards? Why not try stacking up physics objects like crates and rubbish bags to make an impromptu staircase? This was the philosophy that underpinned Deus Ex, and no other game since has even tried to be as open to different user play-styles and ingenious solutions. Wrap all that up in a grittily believable world, with just dripped atmosphere and had an incredible soundtrack, and which moreover was filled with deep questions such as \"who is really in control of society?\", and you have an incredible, incredible game. People who want a high-octane first person shooter in the vein of Half-Life should keep away. This game is far more cold, and calculated, than it is high-octane. Those looking for a Mass Effect-style game, which is brutally linear in the gameplay but allows for some trivial choices in conversations, should also look away here. Deus Ex does things the other way around: conversations are functional and barebones, but the way that the user \"chooses\" paths comes from what he or she does in the gameplay. As an interactive medium, I believe this is as it should be. This is a game for which I have a lot of love, as you can no doubt see. I think it understood exactly what a game is and what it should do better than any others I have played. It\\'s not for everyone, as I have outlined, nor should it be regarded as perfect (although it is very close). Technology of 2000 was pretty limiting, especially graphically and in terms of AI programming. On the other hand, if you like games at all, and want to experience something a tad more cerebral and involving than the Mass Effects and Call of Duties of the gaming world, then you can do no better than Deus Ex.Imitators have tried but none have topped this masterpiece. Combines genres flawlessly and has a flexible story that truly changes based on your actions with multiple endings. The only downside are the graphics (which were bad even for their time), but this can be fixed with mods. Any modern PC can run this so you have no excuse for not playing this.This is, without a doubt, the best game ever made. If I had to narrow down why that is so, it would probably be its impeccable execution. Ignoring the graphics of the time and the limitations of the Unreal engine, this game is near flawless. People sometimes criticize the voice acting, but I think it ads flavor to the whole experience. What would DX be without \"What a shame.\" and \"Oh my god, JC, a bomb!\", right?\\nThe narrative flows seamlessly, the characters (even the minor ones) are beautifully fleshed out and the game play is rewarding and fits with the story.  Oh, and everything makes sense. Don\\'t you just hate those games that make you go WTF?? Well, that never happens with this game.\\n\\nDeus Ex discourages shooting stuff and instead encourages alternative, preferably non-confrontational ways of completing missions. You have a multitude of ways to avoid fights, and a multitude of ways to dispatch enemies without having to shoot them. Characters even scold you for shooting stuff up. You\\'re not compelled in any way to go in guns blazing, unless you specifically want to. So why this game is being judged as an FPS is completely beyond me.A game that makes you think outside the box.\\n\\nDeus Ex is just a pleasure to play, never once do you get frustrated at the game, every mistake is your fault. Is it faultless? No, but that doesn\\'t make it any less of a masterpiece. Deus Ex has such a riveting story with so many intriguing characters most notably Morgan Everett and Walton Simons that will keep you engrossed for your entire playthrough. The gameplay is also superb allowing for many different experiences each playthrough as there are so many ways to complete an objective. You can kill, knock out or simply avoid your enemies, the choice is yours. There\\'s also many ways to get to your objective.\\n\\nThe graphics are obviously outdated (but it kinda has it\\'s own charm) but with the OpenGL renderer the game still plays like a dream and I was using fairly meh integrated graphics on my Linux PC, I would go against using the DirectX renderer, even on Windows, runs like total balls. The soundtrack is also wonderful and adds even more immersion to the levels, my personal favourite being Enemy Within. The voice acting is awful, but has a charm and I actually like the way it is as opposed to Human Revolution.\\n\\nJust get this game. It\\'s one of, if not the greatest PC games of all time. If you don\\'t like it.... \"What a shame\"\\n\\nP.S. I encountered a game breaking glitch where everyone in my save was aggro at me, this could simply be due to using Ubuntu to play this game using Wine, but my advice, save a lot. The glitch set me back 45 mins.This is my favorite game of all time, and it may be yours. This game is an RPG with action elements, and you can do what you want in the game. You can go through the entire game without killing a single characters, even grunts! You can go through the game mattering on the skills you choose, your good at hacking? Hack that console to turn on a turret and wipe out a room of bad guys. Good at stealth? Sneak past them knocking out only that ones you have to. And many, many more ways to go through this monster of a game. The characters in this game feel so real, you may forget you are playing a video game. The graphics are great for the time, especially with a game this long. If you are playing on realistic (highest difficulty in the game) it can take you 15 hours, and even more. The first level alone takes an hour. I still remember when this game came out, and my parents buying it for me, still have my original copy; Anyway, this game has huge replay value, you can take the game a whole different route! Guns blazing? Or Silent? You decide.No words can do this masterpiece a justice, so I will put it simply: Deus Ex is the best game ever made. I\\'m playing games for the last 25 years, I played hundreds, if not thousands of titles and I came across many masterpieces and fantastic games, but for the last 14 years my opinion is clear about one thing, the strongest experience i got from a video game, was here with Deus Ex and if there ever was a game that should be considered \"the best of them all\", it\\'s Deus Ex. The Story, the atmosphere, gameplay, level design it\\'s all out of this world, it\\'s like this game is something more than just a game, it\\'s something that cannot be expressed in words, you must play this. Your life is not fulfilled if you haven\\'t played Deus Ex. It\\'s that simple. The soundtrack by Alexander Brandon, omg, that music, I love it to death, Hong Kong theme playing in the background while writing this reviewAn instant classic I have played for two years, until I knew every corner, dialogue and scripted event like the back of my pocket. It even tempted me to try speed gaming it. Walton Simons is a wonderfully conceived character, cold voice, arrogance and inhumane ambitions. JC Denton is somehow cool although a cyborg and naive in the beginning. Plus you got to like the nonchalence of Smuggler. The best Action-Adventure ever.Combining several games such as System Shock, Half-Life and the Matrix, you create one of the best FPS/RPG hybrid games of all time. Although add-ons enhance this game with better textures and bug fixes, the overall game is very awesome combined with a balance of good sound, story and the environment. Only drawbacks are the chunky dialogue and buggy gaming performance (which did not work well on Windows 7).… ExpandSimply a masterpiece.There\\'s not a lot to say that you won\\'t get from the hundreds of other reviews here. The story is very well done, and the gameplay is a very original FPS/RPG hybrid. At times the game seems just slightly repetitive, and that\\'s the only thing holding it back from a 10.I can\\'s say much, just that Deus Ex is the best game I have ever played, I can go on and on giving reasons to justify that but I don\\'t need to waste my time with that since all the other people\\'s reviews are the same thing.This is one of the best games I\\'ve ever played. I never played it until 2011, but after playing the 3rd installment of the series (which I enjoyed a lot), I decided to try out the earliest version. I was not disappointed in the slightest. In fact, I enjoyed this game even more than the 3rd one. I\\'m usually not a fan of FPS games, I\\'ve tried many but their has only been a couple that I liked enough to sink into for more than an hour or two. But this is a FPS with a well written and thought out story, and the way the FPS and RPG elements are intertwined is done perfectly. There\\'s enough side missions to get you exploring all the nooks and crannies of the well designed world, and the story forks off in several directions depending on your decisions, allowing for you to play a few areas several times to see what happens in each story line. There is a lot of awesome gaming in this game.While Deus Ex graphics now look very dated, to date no FPS can hold a candle to the depth of Deus Ex\\'s RPG & character customisation, gameplay and story. Deus Ex gives you real options and meaningful  choice\\'s that leads to more choices & options and the deep character customisation allows for the player to play to the style s/he likes, tasks and mission can be completed multiple ways and its all that which makes Deus Ex a Masterpiece.Ignore the limited number of negative reviews surrounding this game. This has to be one of the greatest RPG video games to ever exist. Sure, the graphics look shoddy nowadays, but the characters, storyline and gameplay still hold up today. It will keep you hooked from start to finish, and lets you play however you want.If you are after a great rpg, please buy this game. It\\'s only problem is graphs and the few glitches but why should this stop someone from getting immersed in possibly the best story line ever, along with its great mechanics (you can walk around with no arms and legs for gods sake!). Please ignore the people that got mad at level one because they cannot complete it, this game requires time and skill as should any game. please buy this game.Deus Ex is a game that proves, even with it\\'s flaws, that it can still be the greatest game of all time. I played this game in 2012, and am currently undergoing my second playthrough. And by god, it is amazing. The freedom of choice, the stellar map design, the augs, the story...... Even with it\\'s flaws, such as the sometimes stupid AI or the strange aiming system, the rest of the content by FAR makes up for it.How impressive it has to be a monument for quality in game development, and how awful it is, that no game has beaten the complexity, non linearity and depth of this game for over 11 years. Deus Ex is perfect, and I wish that every serious game developer takes it as one.Eh, I wish there were more games like this.Basically, play this game. Full of little flaws and far from perfect, and yet still in the top 5 games of all time... which should give you an indication of just how good it is. Of all the \\'classic old\\' games it\\'s probably aged the best, the atmosphere is just unrivalled, outlasting the graphics. Even the creators haven\\'t come close to replicating it\\'s genius.So... I have read opinions like \"this game is outdated, horrible graphics etc\"\\nI found DX after playing Human revolution... (a few months ago)\\nYeah, at first it was weird jump into those old graphics and so on... But after about six hours game-play I must say I was living JC Denton\\'s role in the game, I mean... Every choice, every dialogue, even the choice of your own gameplay. Yes, there wasn\\'t those dramatic cutscenes, but DX made me more excited than most of the new games i have played\\nAlso atmosphere, soundtrack just perfectly fits to the environment. So what I was playing only new games with those fancy graphics, I still can see how beautiful this game is. Some people just don\\'t understand this game\\'. So after all those gaming years I found my best game that changed whole gaming experience for me... It\\'s sad to see how people can be ignorant by saying this game \"sucks\"just because they don\\'t understand it and it\\'s not nostalgic or something, like I said, I found it in 2011. Also new generation of gamers are just graphic whores, at least you could your subjective ignorant opinion without any real argument keep for yourself. Oh well, I\\'m glad I found this gameMista Denton, in the fleeesss\\n\\nDeus Ex - every time you mention it, someone reinstalls it. One of those games that never really gets old. The story, the gameplay, the dialog, and best of all - the music. Everything was perfect.\\n\\nSmashthestate!One of the best game i have played. Its perfect in all senses, only ruined in part with that animations...but nothing important having in mind how awesome it is.FANTASTIC. Ignore all those idiots who gave this game a low rating. This is likely a all-time-top-5-game in RPG genre. Great voice acting, great plots, great commands, easy learning curve, a bit hard to master.\\nTho graphics are somewhat dated now, this is indeed a Great game. Go for it, and have fun.This game is one of the best games I have played. Meaningful choices, several paths for accomplishing missions, tons of secrets and an epic story. Best cyberpunk thriller in game form! If you haven\\'t played this, there is a modded HD version available!One of my favorite games of all time. Don\\'t let its dated graphics mislead you. The story is excellent, the gameplay is alot of fun, and the soundtrack is my favorite in a video game.I finally played and finished this great cyberpunk themed FPS-RPG-stealth hybrid genre classic. You are JC Denton, international United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) peace force agent fighting NFS terrorist organization in dystopian 2052 New York. New, unknown virus (\"the grey death\"), widespread zyme drug addiction, police curfew are the reality. You aren\\'t just a regular person, you are nano-augmented. This means you have bionic upgrades giving you almost superhuman capabilities in some fields.\\n\\nThe game has some first person shooter qualities. There are multiple types of firearms including pistols, shotguns, sniper and assault rifles, experimental plasma guns, tranquilizer darts and various melee weapons including swords, batons, crowbars and knives. You can also use various grenades and explosives. But here come the RPG qualities: you are initially inexperienced with all of these weapons and as the game progresses you need to choose skills to upgrade. How about some stealth? You don\\'t have to upgrade your fighting skills. You can upgrade swimming, lockpicking and hacking. Deus Ex is not-so-linear and usually you have more than one way to finish a level. Fighting is one option, but usually you can also crawl into ventilation ducts, climb some ladders, jump some containers and find yourself on the other side without having killed a single person (or bot).\\n\\nAlong with upgrading your skills, you choose and upgrade your bionic augmentations. Your game tactics will depend on implants you choose. There are 18 types of implants, but you only have 9 slots. You get to decide whether you prefer to install Speed Enhancement or Run Silent implant. Will you need Ballistic Protection (reduced bullet damage) or EMP Shield (protection from electrocution which is used by some bots)? To use your augmentations you need to use bioelectrical energy and you need to plan carefully, because it has limits.\\n\\nJC Denton will discover conspiracy, traitors, surprising allies in many locations, all of them with neo-noir feel. New York City, Hong Kong (think Blade Runner), Paris, Area 51, ships, hotels, underwater labs. The plot is really long, has many surprise twists and gives you multiple choices, including three quite different endings. Music is quite cool and fits the atmosphere of the locations. Graphics... well, the game was released in 2000, so it\\'s a little disappointing as of 2014, but if you can get over average graphics, Deus Ex is amazingly immersing.When I played the game in 2000, is was unsurpassed. Then I played it again a few years later, and recently too, 14 years after it was released. This time round, I downloaded some graphic mods which lessened the impact of outdated graphics.\\n\\nThe verdict? Still the best PC game ever. The plot, the dark atmosphere of a civilisation spiralling into chaos, the conspiracy theories, the level design-it is simply amazing and nothing since has compared to it, period.\\n\\nMinor gripes are the character model quality and animations are still that of a 14 year old game, but really, it is still top!One of my all time favorite games.  The story is incredibly immersive and and has a well polished, player driven plot.  You actually feel like your choices matter and the consequences of your mistakes can be heartbreaking.  The character development is extremely well polished and drives the player to become emotionally invested in the a number of their digital comrades.  I\\'ve replayed this game from start to end more times than I can count and it seems that every time I play, I discover new ground.  What I truly love about this game are the choices that you might not even realize you have after a single play through.  Characters you thought were doomed to die for the sake of the plot can be saved and objectives that you were not aware of on a first time play through present themselves with a little more exploring.\\n\\nBecause the game is pushing 15 years, the graphics and mechanics are nowhere near up to par with modern games, but the player driven story is better than any game I\\'ve played its release.The best game I would recommend anyone! seriously, the story and everything about it is brilliant. The game is all about fighting crime to get down to the bottom of things, with your augmentation, you are JC denton!One of the best game ever! Perfect design comes together with really useful RPG element. And at the end... do you want to shot your way through the game or maybe stealth is the way you like?Awesome storyline... The background music is \"simply the best\".. FPS, RPG, stealth game: you can find every kind of game, in Deus Ex; you can choose how to play: you can play like Sam Fisher, but you can play like Serious Sam. It all depends on you tastes... THE BEST!I have spent many hours, days and weeks playing this. Excellent storyline and atmosphere, many ways how to play it - with a rocket launcher or hidden in shadows, just how you like it.Except for the graphics which are truly horrible, this is a masterpiece. Pure perfection, all the elements come together and make one of the best and most unique games ever. What really makes it shine is the story, which has many twists and suprises, and always feels very compelling. Games like these aren\\'t made anymore.One of the best games I\\'ve played. Too much of action and long levels in the end part, but I guess you can run through it with the correct augmentations, so that isn\\'t necessarily a problem. What I liked most was the plot and the illusory freedom of choice.It is very difficult to pigeonhole this game into a genre and this is probably one of its strongest points. But you don\\'t have to be a fan of any genre to realise that this game is special. Great story, good replayability, interesting special abilities, a good variety of weapons, many different ways to complete missions and a great soundtrack. This game has it all. Even the hero\\'s very monotonous voice is strangely compelling. Fantastic entertainment on many levels. The only thing that I can criticise it for is the pathetic attempts at foreign accents of which the Australian variety was particularly atrocious. But still, this is a must play for any gamer, any gamer at all.I can see why it\\'s very well praised: it\\'s a very good shoter with few rpg elements and it actually gives you many choices and ways to play the game; add also a very good story behind it, with some huge places to explore too, and you get  Deus ex....but I still wouldn\\'t suggest this game for everyone. Let me clear this: I enjoyed it, I loved it to the end, but It has some huge problems that makes this game very\"old:I hated how the game is based on \"Trial & Error\", which will make you destroy the autosave button in order to finish a mission. Yes the AI is buggy, but sometimes they are just too strong: they were able to see me, from the other side of the map, hiding in pure darkness and down below a street...WOW, buggy AI right? It might be buggy, but sometimes they could see me (and HEAR even while sneaking) too well. And this might be nitpicking, but I would have loved a map of the area: they are HUGE and it\\'s very hard to see where you have to go without a map, making you  lose the way. Ok, the rant is over: I give it a 8 mainly because it IS good, but to me it\\'s just aged: stealth games have evolved for the better and this game, even though created a standard for stealth shooters, has basically lost it\\'s innovation: give it a try though if you can surpass the flaws and, in general, if you don\\'t agree with me.This is my favorite game of all time.  I must have played this all the way through at least 5 times.  There are multiple endings, and usually 3-4 ways to do everything.This game is not easy, which may be why some people are giving it negative reviews - if you are a brainless 12 year old who only likes FPS games, you will probably be too dumb to complete this game.If, however, you know what a quality game is - you will love this title.It is very old at this point, however, so you should go pick up the new Deus Ex title - Human Revolution.  It is also excellent.Despite being part stealth, part shooter and part rpg, it actually manages to transcend any sort of pigeon hole and becomes a genre unto itself.  And what an astounding one it is too.  Very good combat, a nice variety of enemies and a great selection of weapon choices making real changes to the feel of gameplay  sum up the fighting, both ranged and melee.  The stealth is a challenge which requires genuine care and thought but provides great satisfaction when successful.  The rpg elements and skills/augmentations allow you to tailor your character in a way that is very rewarding and allows for several playthroughs that give a different feel.Finally, these elements are bound tightly together by an amazing story that includes many memorable moments and wonderfully created characters, locations and situations.  Easily one of the greatest games of all time and my personal favourite.The game is very fun to play and is one of my favourite FPS/RPG games. The story is outstanding and the fact that you can majorly affect it throughout the game makes it even more interesting and adding replayability trying to get a slightly different story. Also the fact that you can play the game any way you like to play it. You can play it like an FPS game, shooting enemies or even as a stealth game sneaking past everything without killing anybody.Boy, when this hit, it hit us Gamers hard! I\\'ll be lying if i say i was prepared for such grandiosity.  Extremely high replay value, awesome story (just the type that hits my spot), excellent writing, memorable characters, sweet sweet gameplay, augmentations!!! Aaaaagh!!! :D\\nLove from first sight :)The story is a very well written amalgamation of every paranoid conspiracy of the last five decades, set in a not too distant or unrecognisable future. You are given the chance to mould and guide your hero from humble bureacratic beginnings to a place in the annals of human history. Give Manderley a punch from me on your way up.The game is a seamless melding of FPS and RPG. A clever twist lets you augment your character with bionic abilities, which can be found in canisters while exploring the game. Most upgrades grant one physiological ability and lock out another permanently, but the detailed inventory and character information pages let you browse the upgrades and plan ahead.The experience based skills system lets you can choose how well you can use items and weapons, if at all. For example, if you haven\\'t put points into rocket launchers, there are subtler methods of bypassing security systems: lockpicking, electronics and computer hacking. Packrats rejoice, this leads to a diverse array of item pickups: credit chits containing digitised money, personal organisers with codes and passwords, biological modification canisters, modification packs for weapons (capacities, fire rates, silencers, etc), lockpicks, multimeters, food or medkits for healing and even chapters from an in-game book. Usually, at least once per level, you\\'ll get a chance to buy items from a black market trader or use your information to rummage through hidden or locked stockpiles.Though the graphical models may look dated, all of these features create a rich gameplay experience that, in my opinion, hasn\\'t yet been surpassed in this genre.This has got to be one of the best games ever made, the storyline just drags you in the charicters are deep and fit well, the shooting system and inventory are very similar to the first game but more polished. I only hope they expand this and make another game.  The inventory holds just enough equipment to make you have to think what you need rather than what you want.  Like any deus ex game there are many vents to crawl through and plenty of places to pick suckers off at a distance with a sniper rifle... you know what they say \"you can run but you\\'ll only die tired\" the charicters are awsome and i particualry liked Eliza cassan.  Come on with the next deus ex game!One of my favourite games. Utterly absorbing. Innovative for its time, it blended genres and seemed to take the best of FPS, stealth and the essence of RPG.A classic PC title and one of my favorite games of all time. While Deus Ex: Human Revolution was still a great game, the original Deus Ex has a greater sense of dread and larger number of conspiracies as well as catchy music and memorable, sometimes funny, dialogue.Believe the hype. There\\'s a reason this gets on every \"best of\" list. Looks long in the tooth now but nobody has ever come close to the perfect balance of stealth, moral choices about life and death and plain action as this game.One of the greatest games I could have laid my hands on in my entire life. As stated by many other reviewers, I will admit that the game has a very frustrating and slow aiming system, but that doesn\\'t bring down the game by very much at all. The story is conveyed in a genius way, most of the plot twists I did not see coming and the story is so interchangeable, you could play the game over and over, and not play it exactly the same as you did the time before. The inventory system isn\\'t as annoying as many other people think, but the game should have automatically moved the items out of the way if you had enough room anyhow. The graphics look outdated quite a bit but the game makes up for it in the way the story is conveyed and how the plot unfolds. Overall great game, while it has it\\'s faults, the game makes up for them in different areas of the game. I\\'d recommend it for everyone.A lot of people claim that Deus Ex: Human Revolutions is a better game than it\\'s predecessor. And that may be true, in some ways. HR certainly has prettier graphics, among other improvements. But it\\'s not the same. Deus Ex was an RPG shooter. The sequel is a shooter with RPG elements that follows the cookie-cutter plan of every cover based shooter game on the market. Cover based shooting, magically regenerating health, XP based upgrade system, not to mention the fact that based on the controls, it\\'s a console game first and a PC game second. Original game may not stand up in terms of prettiness, but it has a better story, more entertaining gameplay, good music, endings that don\\'t consist entirely of stock footage with a vague monologue laid over...\\n\\nHonestly, if this game were to be redone today, it would probably be the best thing ever. It\\'s got plenty of fun to it, plenty of runtime (Story takes forever to push through, but it\\'s not a drag) detailed, fleshed out world, interesting characters, and a matrixey feeling that you\\'re not just playing a game, you\\'re playing art.\\n\\nI guess that\\'s the biggest part. Human Revolutions is a game. The original Deus Ex is a game too, but it\\'s also art, it\\'s also a story, it\\'s also a whole world to explore.I must be one of the few people who played Deus Ex: Human Revolution BEFORE playing the original. Seems appropriate enough though, since HR is a prequel anyway. After having completed this one, I noticed that there is clearly continuity between the two games, including story and gameplay elements, locations, similar characters, and even the same bits of dialogue. Anyway, this is overall a solid game that I wish I\\'d played 12 years ago when it came out. It took me about 30 hours to play from start to finish. My only real complaint is it\\'s always dark throughout the game, but everything else about it is absolutely solid. I completed my first playthrough a couple of days ago, and will probably play it again. If you\\'re reading this review and haven\\'t played this game yet, stop reading and go play it!Quite rightly considered by many as the greatest PC game of all time. This is simply stunning and when it was released in 2000 it completely rewrote gaming.\\n\\nThe best thing about this game is that it doesn\\'t feel like a game. The levels are so huge, the characters so interactive, and the puzzles solved in so many different ways that this feels like a limitless world. Every element comes together perfectly: an incredible storyline that has you tied up in knots, gameplay that allows you to play the way you want to play, and an augmentation system that lets you mould your character in weird and wonderful ways.\\n\\nDo you want to be a stealthy assassin? Then develop your hacking, sniping and running silently skills, stick a silence modification on your sniper rifle and away you go. Want to run round shooting anything that moves? Then level up your ballistic shielding, stick a couple of recoil modifications on your machine gun, and let\\'s get to work. As long as you have a consistent plan, any gameplay style is catered for.\\n\\nI\\'m still waiting to play a game since Deus Ex that even comes close.What can be said that hasn\\'t already been said about this game?  It\\'s...really, it\\'s one of those very rare games that just nails it.  It\\'s really basically perfect.   Ultimate fun, ultimate immersion, and an ultimate experience.  This is one of the first RPGs I ever played where you have a choice, where the way you play actually affects the outcome of the game.  In some ways I think a lot of games after this have tried to emulate that format, because it was so amazing in this game.  If you haven\\'t tried it yet, go for it.  Really, get it.Having played the newest installment in the Deus ex franchise, I was curious as to how this was stack up against the jack of all trades action/stealth conspiracy game set in 2027. I am happy to say this game is just as good (if not better) Deus ex human revolution. sure it may be a bit unbalanced and you\\'ll probably have to rebind all the keys as the controls are very outdated and the graphics aren\\'t special for today\\'s standards but that can be far overlooked if you consider just how ambitious and free this game is. it really makes you feel like YOU are the main character, letting you choose which skills and augmentations cater best to your play style. I defiantly recommend it to anyone who wises for real choice in a game and not the illusion of it. back then It would be an absolute 10 but by today\\'s standards i give a 9. You\\'d be crazy not buy it as it is around 5$ nowadays.Best game ever made PERIOD. It\\'s just perfect and nothing else has even come close.Stunning, almost nothing I\\'ve played compares!!!!!!!!!!!!:)The best game ever. I remember playing it the first time, it changed the way I looked at computer gaming. Every game I have played since I compare to Deus Ex, and so far not one game has beaten this masterpiece. The atmosphere, the plot, the characters and the abillity to choose how you want to play is probably what makes this game stand out in the crowd. Anyone that claims they\\'re real gamers ought to play this game, but it is also a good game to play for people that haven\\'t played much computer games before because of the great plot and atmosphere. Everything combined it feels as if being in a movie, with you being the main character doing all decisions.Excellent, have replayed it many times. Much more thoughtful and less linear than it\\'s sequel.One of my favorite games of all time. Long, but never felt long-winded. Good voice acting and great story with plot twists. Nifty but simple skill system. Modifyable weapons. A choice of different endings. It also got #1 \\'best game\\' award 3 years in a row from Australia\\'s PC Powerplay magazine.This game is unbelievable! I love this game!I haven\\'t played it for a while but it still stands out as one of the better PC games in my mind. Blending stealth, RPG style leveling up (sort of), FPS action, and a very compelling story. Throw in 4 different endings, branching paths, different upgrades to add to your character and you get the replay value there. The graphics could be more polished but they get the job done good enough, i liked the audio throughout the game though. That death throe voice by JC makes me laugh. HA. This review\\'s getting too long, have fun.Blew my mind.The best game every with it\\'s gripping plot and cool \"bad guys\".The best game ever played. Ignore the graphics. Ignore the AI and physics. This game is almost perfect. The only flaws are that some of the augmentations are much more useful than others. This game is so open and free, there are countless ways to do things. People even discovered ways to beat missions that the developers didnt know about(without cheating of course.) The level design is without a doubt the best in any game ever made, bar none. And the plot...oh the plot. Extremely gripping. The first time Icarus speaks was one of the coolest moments in any game I\\'ve ever played.Best game of all time. If you do not own this game, find it and buy it. The sequel is worth picking up as well only if you have a good rig, but the sequel is not quite as good. They are both excellent games and well-worth playing. I pray to god that there is going to be a third one despite the death of Ion Storm developer.This game is the only FPS style game that has ever caught my attention so memorably. Alongside GTA and the old X-Com series of games, this is undeniably in a league of its own. Many newer gamers view Half Life 2 as the modern equivalent of an iconic game, but this in no way compares to the brilliance of Deus Ex; try this once and you will understand exactly how Deus Ex forces you to move the goalposts when rating every other subsequent game. It acts as a forceful comparator to remind you of just how close to perfection a game needs to be to compete. The graphics are looking rather dated in modern times, but it is the intricate and interactive plot and intense characterisation that makes Deus Ex tower far above its peers. Six years on and there has still never been a better game within this genre, or even one that comes close for that matter. ThereMake no mistake, this is the greatest single-player experience for the PC. There are so many incredible momments in Deus Ex, and it truly raised the bar wth regards to interactivity, story telling, and open-ended gameplay. Expect a game that will demand your full attention, and will keep you engrossed for many, many hours. An extraordinary achievement, and a testament to the skill and imagination of the developers.Best game I\\'ve ever played, and it\\'s now 2006.Easily one of the best video games ever made. It incorporating a great story, RPG-style inventory with experience points used to increase skills, fun combat with countless weapons and items, good music, memorable events and dialogue, incredible replay value, and an extremely dynamic and lengthy campaign, which is different every time you play, due to the incredible amount of freedom. After playing through the game 5 times, I still found many new things and places that I had never found before, and triggered events and plot twists that I hadn\\'t come across in 4 play-throughs. Each playthrough was with a drastically different approach, as the game incorporates many different play-styles, including playing with \"realistic\" combat damage for those who wish to. Not enough can be said about this game. It\\'s like \"The Godfather\" of video games, in more ways than one.It is a MUST buy/play for a hardcore FPS player. Truly a great game with an amazingly twisted storyline and plot that could be beaten in one one of four different ways.Absolutely, positively #1 on my list of all time favorite games. It\\'s now Feb or 2007 and I just got finished playing through DX again and my only regret is that I can\\'t go back and play it again for the first time, before I knew all the little tricks and secrets of the game.Deus Ex is the single most groundbreaking game I have ever played.This could be the game of the millenium ....... one of or maybe the best game i ever played to date...re-play value is amazing ... a must to own ...It is a good game but if you have played Half life you will be dissapointed. The graphics are outdated but not horrible. The AI are pretty good. Controls are not that great  but not horrible. If you like shooting / adventure games ,get this game you wont be dissapointed.Deus Ex - a title that has a huge cult following. Although I don\\'t fully understand all the reasons that led to it, my review of this game is still going to be positive. / The fact is, the game\\'s graphics were outdated even at the time of its creation. But surprisingly enough, this fact didn\\'t bother me much during singleplayer experience (also, I am not exactly into top-notch graphics at all times, I still like retro games if there are other aspects that I like about those titles). The multiplayer, on the other hand, oh yeah, that is a slightly different story... I remember that it was hard to keep a straight face in situations like when your own teammates got poisoned by gas grenades... / One of the main strengths of the game are the possibilities that lie in front of you. Stealth vs. action is divided into a lot of smaller options you can choose from. You can kill everything in sight, stun your opponents or put them to sleep, avoid them altogether by choosing alternative paths, use not only weapons and tools, but also augmentations to your advantage... These elements really made the game fun to play. Nothing forced you into choosing one particular solution (e.g. stealth is better than action - make love, not war - DX: HR, anyone?), so you could enjoy the game the way you wanted to, without any penalties (at least I don\\'t remember any). / The augmentation system is generally a nice idea and I like the fact that you have to choose between several upgrades to determine which one you want to install on that particular body part. Some augmentations however I found kind of obsolete and I think I didn\\'t use them once during the whole game. You can also invest points into various skills to help you further during the gameplay (weapon use, hacking, lockpicking and... swimming - OMG, that was kind of obsolete too). And yeah, the hacking and lockpicking are very primitive, on the other hand, if I have to choose between tiresome minigames and beeping multitools, I pick the second option, thankyouverymuch. / The game is definitely... long. I dropped out twice (once in the ship area and once in France), but returned after several months and I am glad I did. There are other titles that deserved to be dropped instantly and I didn\\'t do it (*facepalm*). I liked the fact there were numerous locations and environments to be visited and explored, although some of them were more boring than the others. But, the longer the gameplay is, the better, sure - phenomenon of a 3 hour-long games that cost 40 bucks is NOT COOL. / Deus Ex is generally praised because of its storyline, which is captivating and original at first. After some time, it gets a little confusing and I had the feeling as if someone wanted to incorporate all the existing \"conspiracy theories\" he could find into the game\\'s story. Maybe less would be more in this case. But not a huge issue for me. / Also, the music definitely deserves mentioning, there are a LOT of tracks, each location has a music of its own, so a huge amount of work went into this. I think it was worth it and the soundtrack is a nice bonus to the overall experience. Voice-acting is not so good, but for me, it provided an amusing aspect, so thanks for that. / I must add that sometimes I felt like I was playing some Star Wars game because of that nanosword, which was strangely addictive. At first, it was good against greasels, then I was overpowered by the dark side and I used it against almost everything, eh.... / The ending (one of the few that are available) wasn\\'t disappointing and the game offers great re-playability not only to experience other endings, but to try different things and approaches. / I\\'m not giving this game a full score like most of the people I see on the last page - it\\'s not the best game I ever played and it has its flaws. But I admit it\\'s one of the better ones (not in the term of graphics, of course) and it can be seen that a lot of effort was put into making some elements as good as possible, which is something that deserves recognition. Unfortunately, nowadays I don\\'t see many modern titles with a \"heart\", and Deus Ex definitely is a game that has a \"nanoheart\", sometimes beating slowly, sometimes rapidly, always being cold, but yes, it\\'s a heart nonetheless.Utterly brilliant.\\n\\nYou are given such freedom and the immersion is so great that you can really engage with this game in a way few others manage. A masterpiece of game design and has yet to be bettered in the action/RPG genre.Like a lot of people said, this game got many things wrong.  Lousy accents for foreign characters, terrible graphics, conspiracy plot that borders on the ridiculous and of course not being able to hit a headshot on a guy even if you\\'re pointing the gun a few centimetres behind him.  But no matter what, you can\\'t help getting pulled into the game by its wonderful ability to show how much your decisions matter.  Small decisions can go  a long way in the game\\'s plot and its very interesting to see it unfold at a later point of the story.  And then, there\\'s the atmosphere and setting which is probably the best part of the game, you can really feel the bleak cyberpunk future where people are struggling to survive.  Not only that, the levels in Hong Kong and Paris are perhaps the best parts of the game even though it should be obvious to some that it looks nothing like the real thing.  Characterization is also interesting, even though the hero JC Denton is blunt and monotoned most of the time.  Still, the dialogue is rather humorous if not corny.  It really baffles me why no game has come close to achieving the feel Deus Ex created (even the highly praised Mass Effect series).  The only beef I have with this game is that its hard to get it working right on my laptop.Deus Ex comes within sight of perfection, and I say this having played it for the first time in 2011. (So don\\'t accuse me of being nostalgic, jerks!)  It is filled with multitudes of interesting gameplay ideas yet never loses focus. This game would never be caught dead initiating cutscene combat sequences to carry out some contrived event (as Human Revolution will). Simply the best story I have ever seen in a video game combined with a deep gameplay system. A word of warning though: the targeting system is very clunky and caused me to despise the game when I first attempted it. This is responsible for most of the negative reviews.Everything about this game has already been said by the other 10pt raters, but this game deserves yet another worshipping. I´m into video games since 1990 and Deus Ex is one of only a handful of games I´d give ten points. And it would be the only one I´d give 11, if possible.\\nEvery other FP RPG/Story-Shooter/Adventure is judged by me to the standart set by DeusEx, and none came near to it yet. And I fear, nothing will ever come...\\nThe Plot is not a blockbuster, but the way it is arranged and experienced, combined with the artfully accomplished atmosphere, makes me wish I´ve never played this game before. Just to experience the immersive feeling again I had when playing the first time back in 2000.\\nThe gameplay isn´t easy at the beginning and since you don´t know the evolution of your char (playing the first time), the motivation curve rises low through the first levels (or maps). But as another Reviewer said: this game will make you think about calling in sick right in the middle of your day not at home, just to get back to your screen.\\nWhat really, really is astonishing are the ways you can choose to build up your char. And the way that´s chosen will affect the gameplay massively. Indestructible heavy weapon bomber? No problem. Sneaky, roof climbing Hacker? No Problem. It´s like playing two different games wich happen to have the same storyline. More or less, Story developement depends on the choices made at critical moments.\\nOkay, so far we´re at a level of quality also arrived by Fallout 3, too. More or less, let´s not be nitpickers.\\nThe topping on this tasty cake of video games are the side quests, side tracks and the sheer endless amount of info available that´s not related to the main story. Newspapers, books, Notepads (sort of), that make the in-game world so lively and realistic... just like a very, very good book you can´t put aside, even if it´s 3am and you have to get up early.\\nAlso, I love the interface. It´s more than versatile. You can make notes by yourself and you can type in keys and passwords with your keyboard. And you need to, if you don´t have the abilities to hack`em! Because even if you already \"know\" a key to a door, you´ll have to look it up in your notepad and type it in by yourself.\\nAnd it never gets boring. No repetitive situations like in newer games (DE3 or even Skyrim), no linear path through the levels, no stereotypes.\\n\\nTo everyone calling himself a \"gamer\" who didn´t play it yet (especially the youngsters): ignore the old graphics and experience this work of art!OVERVIEW\\nA story-heavy FPS with platforming, stealth and RPG elements.\\n\\nPRESENTATION - 8\\nGraphics aren\\'t great technically (it looks like the first Unreal Tournament from 1999), and almost no objects have physics.  But aesthetically, everything fits the cyberpunk themes really well, music is great, and all lines are voice-acted (a big deal back then).  The story is superb, the greatest blend of conspiracy theories ever in a single product, and with a better understanding of the philosophy of technology than anything in the 15 years since.  What\\'s great about all the optional flavor-text is half of it is actually gameplay-relevant, giving you codes and passwords, which encouraged you to talk to everyone and read everything.\\n\\nCONTROLS - 8\\nFPS controls are smooth, and you can interact with everything in the world with just a right mouse button click.  The game is hard: sights take way too long to become accurate unless you pour upgrade points into that weapon system, the \"tranquilizer\" causes enemies to run around for 10 seconds shooting back at you before they keel over, and the only other nonlethal knockout option besides tranq darts requires (very) limited ammo.  Both violent and nonviolent options are difficult: you have limited inventory options, and the every \"Augmentation\" option excludes a different Aug, so you are constantly making meaningful choices. But since the game allows quicksaving/quickloading, and you never feel lost in terms of what to do next, it all works brilliantly despite the complexity.\\n\\nDESIGN - 10\\nWhat makes the game is that every encounter or puzzle has multiple solutions.  When most (including Deus Ex\\'s sequels) games say \"multiple ways to play,\" they really mean 3 ways to play: 1)stealth around enemies\\' lines of sight  2)snipe enemies from hiding with a sniper rifle or silenced pistol or 3)kill everything  like you\\'re playing a shooter.  You can do that in Deus Ex 1, but you can also talk your way out of situations, lay traps, stack crates (they can obscure cameras), jump around obstacles or hack camera/turret systems; all of those are also solutions to boss battles.  Every room has at least 3 means of entry/exit, so while in most games \"exploration\" would mean \"not knowing where to go,\" in Deus Ex it\\'s almost impossible to get lost because there are so many different ways to get to the objective you stumble across it automatically.  You choose your preferred gameplay style by picking which superpowers and skills (i.e., super-jumping will assist the platforming route) you upgrade. If you miss the document with the secret code to the locked door, it doesn\\'t matter, because you can lockpick it open, blast it open, or get inside the warehouse through a different route.  The game is also brilliantly adaptive; normally when a game is \"realistic\" it means the Shenmue-open-world system of having a bunch of irrelevant interactive minigames that delay your progress; here, realism means letting you choose your path and actions and having characters react to it realistically.  You can kill allies, but they\\'ll shoot back.\\nMy favorite part was at a ramp (leading to an optional arms merchant with good stuff for sale) protected by a laser tripwire that would release a robot drone when triggered.  I kept reloading that section, testing out different ways to get past it, just for fun: 1)trigger the \\'bot and shoot it out  2) lay an EMP or explosive mine on the wall, trigger the bot and it would roll right into the trap and kill itself  3) if you talked to the right person earlier in the level, he would give you a code to the nearby panel to disable the tripwire 4) you could use multitools to hack the panel, fewer multitools if you invested in the computers skill  5) using the speed augmentation, you could run past, triggering the bot but escape before it shot you 6)using either a stealth camo item pickup or the stealth augmentation, you could walk through the tripwire without triggering it 7) by stacking crates (easier if you got the muscle augmentation to lift the heavier crates) you could build a little staircase to walk over the tripwire without triggering it  8) with the superjump augmentation you could leap the tripwire without triggering it  9) If you placed a crate in the path of the tripwire, it would trigger, but you could hide, and after the bot returned to its original waiting position, the tripwire would only extend until the position of the crate, which interrupted it; then you could walk between the crate and the wall without triggering the tripwire  10) there was a nearby vent that let you bypass the ramp entirely.\\n\\nLEGACY - What I would have liked for the sequel would be better graphics, physics, and improved enemy AI.  We got that, but in the grand tradition of sequels having fewer gameplay mechanics, the newer Deus Ex games are merely shooters with a stealth option and more dialogue choices than in most games.  Deus Ex 1 stands alone, and it is a must-play for any videogame fan.One of the best games of all time. If you haven\\'t played it, you must.\\nThe graphics don\\'t look as impressive now as they were in 1999, but the gameplay still rocks. The story is clever and very interesting. Just make sure you click on all NPCs a few times to let they say all their phrases. I must admit I haven\\'t seen comparable games in all these years..Among the best games ever made. There\\'s just so many ways to play and complete your tasks: you can avoid killing, try silent killing or just shoot everything standing in your way. The storyline is superb, I could have never imagined that video games could be philosophical.I had never heard of Deus Ex until I watched a review of the original game on Youtube. Finally, out of pure curiosity  I bought the game on Amazon. I cut to the chase . This is the single greatest game I have ever played in my life,  from the sprawling open levels to the intriguing story line. Sure the game is a graphical Quasimodo by today\\'s standards but the depth in gameplay balance that out. I never thought that the RPG and the FPS genre would ever be able to meld so seemlessly, but they did and for that I award Deus Ex a 10 out of 10. A true masterpiece.Hailed as the best game of all time for many reasons.\\n\\nDeus Ex attained an average of 90% and a 90/100 (universal acclaim) in both the MobyGames and Metacritic.\\nEn.wikipedia.org\\n\\nIts been given over 40 \"Game of the Year\" and/or \"Best in Class\" awards in many distinguished magazines and websites.\\n\\nIt set the standard in FPS/RPG genre with varied gameplay, allowing players to choose how they want to tackle any situation, expansive environments (multi-paths, & multi-solutions which is still ground breaking in terms of giving players freedom), high level of player customization to allow you to excel in different fields, emphasis on exploration (aided by large environments & many useful items to find), ambitious and layered storyline, interactive storytelling, dialogue that references philosophy, politics, terrorism, ailments of mankinds, a government by the people, the question of the self, and the future of mankind ect.. & lots of readables to complement this (datacubes, books, emails ect), its high replayability, memorable sound track.\\nIn other words: a winning formula.\\n\\nIts sad to see that the common gamer of the new generation most likely wouldn\\'t know about this game. Younger people aren\\'t very literate when it comes to older things but it doesn\\'t magically make all these websites & reviews & all those fans that played Deus Ex disappear... & it certainty doesn\\'t stop the old Deus Ex from being put on shelves for a bargain price again and again. Its good to see people who pre-ordered Deus Ex Human Revolution got the original Deus Ex for free.\\n\\nTheres mods being released to this day: like Project 2027, New Vision (which enhances about 75% of the games textures) so bad graphics isn\\'t an excuse not to play it (though the animations still look outdated but no big deal).\\n\\nIf FPS/RPG\\'s held this game as a standard, we would see great things.\\n\\nWe need something to set high standards, otherwise how can we progresDeus Ex has got to be one of the greatest games of all time. Yeah, some may complain that the graphics are horrible but, the game was released in 2000, and at that time, these graphics were high quality. This game is still regarded as the greatest game of all time, and I agree with that statement.This might sound cliched, but this is one of the best games ever made. Everything works, the story, the atmosphere, the great RPG style gameplay. Look past the dated ugly graphics, and the sometimes lazy AI and you have a game that still 13 yrs later is still relavant, and worthwhile.I wish I had never played this game  so I could play it through now and relive the experience. Compared to recent games it doesn\\'t stand a chance, but if you can look past the graphics and the old game engine (which were both fine when it was released) then a great and immerse story is waiting for you. This game is simply the best FPS-RPG adventure ever made.If you haven\\'t played it yet, get on it. You won\\'t be sorry.',\n",
       " 'Fitting in neatly with the lineage of previous optical illusion based puzzlers such as Echochrome and Crush. Superlimnal brings a first-person view to the table. It spent many years (Original reveal was all the way back in 2013!) in development, and it is certainly worth the wait!It certainly fits in the mold of first-person puzzlers which usually blow your perceptive mind, which I’m a huge fan of, but this is a bit too short and undercooked for its full price. Definitely get on sale like I did.Really unique (from anything I\\'ve played anyway) and carries a really great theme. Several surprises and tonal shifts throughout kept me invested, but the gameplay did get a little repetitive and some of the puzzle solutions were nonsensical. A fun little game, even if I did get tired of falling through the floor towards the end.I read that this game was a bit dull, so I didn\\'t have any high expectations. There\\'s just a pair of moments when you say \"oh, that\\'s clever\". And then there\\'s the rest of the game.\\n\\nThere is some kind of British narrator that breaks the fourth wall, like in Stanley Parable. There are also some puzzles with visual effects, like in The Witness. There are some other puzzles with non-euclidean spaces, much like Portal or Antichamber. But the game does not excel at anything. There are also some issues with performance and implementation of some visual effects, but that might just be a problem of the Switch version.\\n\\nIt\\'s also quite short, but the game still managed to get me bored to death. This is definitely nothing compared with the cleverness of some other clever games like the games mentioned above, or some others available on the Switch, like Baba is You.Superliminal is a smart, inventive puzzle game all about perspective.\\n\\nThe puzzles are good fun and are fairly original thanks to the game\\'s unique mechanics. They\\'re a little difficult to explain, but it\\'s very intuitive when playing the game - for the most part, what it boils down to is that you can manipulate the size of some objects, and duplicate some others. It\\'s a short game, clocking in at a little over 2 hours, but Superliminal makes pretty good use of it\\'s mechanics in that short runtime; the game manages to pack in a good number of satisfying puzzles plus a neat little story with a nice message that ties in to the game\\'s themes perfectly. It could\\'ve pushed these mechanics further though, and the puzzles in the latter half of the game could\\'ve been more complex.\\n\\nOverall, I quite enjoyed Superliminal. It\\'s a briskly paced puzzler with cool original mechanics that doesn\\'t overstay it\\'s welcome. It\\'s not as refined as it could\\'ve been, and although the story is certainly thematically consistent, it\\'s perhaps a little on the nose. However, this is a memorable experience through a strange dream world that\\'s good fun for a couple of hours.Overall a good puzzle game with decently designed atmosphere across the entire playthrough.  However the puzzles are slightly repetitive and not highly interesting or thought provoking. The story itself is good yet not the level of SOMA or Talos Principle.Great idea and poor implementation. I am really a fan of this type of game and was very impressed with the trailer. Nevertheless, in fact, the game was very easy, the puzzles are pretty damn easy and simple. There is no sense of challenge, I really don\\'t feel anything moving in my brain.This is almost a good game. The makers of Subliminal had a good idea about solving puzzle using perspective, and they sort of made it work, but they got so many things wrong.\\n\\nStarting with the game\\'s strengths, some of the puzzles are genuinely challenging and thought-provoking. I also found it interesting that in certain stages the player can find a way outside of the puzzle area, and enjoy a sort of an easter egg. All this would\\'ve been fun, if it weren\\'t for some glaring issues.\\n\\nThis is where it starts to fall apart. In a first-person 3D puzzler, it\\'s important to get the movement mechanics right, and unfortunately Superliminal just didn\\'t. Both movement and look-around are locked at a constant speed, making this game extremely cumbersome to navigate. Top that with the fact that many of the puzzles require fairly precise positioning, and you\\'ve got yourself an constant exercise in frustration.\\n\\nThe narration is simply terrible. The makers of Subliminal clearly tried to imitate Portal narratively, but had neither the writing talent, nor the voice acting talent available to them, winding up with a monotonous, repetitive set of bad jokes, and no character development whatsoever.\\n\\nThe puzzles range from pretty good to not a puzzle. Many of the game\\'s \"puzzles\" consist of walking from point A to point B, which sometimes takes an excruciatingly long time, due to the game\\'s physics and movement mechanics. Other puzzles required finding a grab-able object among a room full non-grab-able objects, providing no way to distinguish between them.\\n\\nLate in the game, a certain puzzle stage has a fail state. As in, if you wind up there, you have to go to the menu and restart from the last check point. Mind you, this is the only point in the game that has a fail state. I literally spent half an hour trying to get out of it, before I finally looked it up in a walk-through, and proceeded to facepalm.\\n\\nThe game\\'s graphics are just mediocre. The models, shading, and lighting are primitive, but they work fairly well with this type of game. However, there are a few artifacts that occur while using the game\\'s perspective-shifting mechanics, that sort of break the immersion.\\n\\nThe sound design, on the other hand, is barely even there. Nothing about it is memorable, or helps the game in any way. Was there music? Environmental cues? Ambience? All I remember is that objects make noises when they\\'re dropped.\\n\\nSuperliminal was so close to being good, that it would totally pass as a good prototype of a game, but it fails terribly as an actual game, due to a lack of any sort of polish, as well as an abundance of design elements that make it excessively frustrating to play.No x-axis inversion option, can\\'t play without getting dizzy and nauseous, no refund option for switch.bought at full price and don\\'t think it\\'s worth the value.\\nGot bored very fast, puzzle solutions are kinda repetitive.. Though there were def moments that surprised me, but before getting to those moments which only showed up once a while, I wasn\\'t intrigued during most of the gameplay..In this time I feel even less desire to play it but well I do not recommend it but in the end you decideGame breaking glitches, clunky, bugs, graphics like knack which is a mastapeeceThis was a very enjoyable puzzle game which reminded me of the unfinished swan. There was maybe one puzzle which was a bit too obtuse but generally it was a fun experience. Visually it was also a real treat especially in the later levels. It\\'s quite short but that was a plus in my opinion. It\\'s the perfect game to relax with and enjoy in between bigger releases. Definitely worth playing in my opinion.The game is more than a sum total of its parts. It’s a game that sticks with you and causes you to see things a little differently after you finish it. It sounds cheesy, but give it a shot and see for yourself. I know all that sounds vague AF, but this is really a game about discovery and learning. If you liked The Witness, this is similar but Superliminal isn’t as cerebral or frustrating.  Superliminal difficultly stays fair through out and it always finds a way to keep you engaged. As surreal as the game gets, it find a way to ground itself and keep you somewhat oriented. It’s also go a nice, dry, dark sense of humor. It’s short, but every bit of it is well worth the price.A great game. Reminded me of Portal even though objectively it is entirely different. Actually different every other game I\\'ve played. Short, but that way it never ran out of ideas.Superliminal is an indie game with nice mechanics. It\\'s a puzzle game which uses the concept of perception and the fact that point of view differs from the point of being. Superliminal is quite a short game with comfy music. It dropped some frames on level8, but overall it was a fine experience which reminded me a little of Portal games. Good humor with great brain exercises which weren\\'t as hard as I thought they might be. 8/10 I will recommend it to friends as well.Fitting in neatly with the lineage of previous optical illusion based puzzlers such as Echochrome and Crush. Superlimnal brings a first-person view to the table. It spent many years (Original reveal was all the way back in 2013!) in development, and it is certainly worth the wait!SuperLiminal is without a doubt an excellent experience, it hits you with the most unique take on puzzle solving and story telling. The  game can be completed in 3-4 hours but it’s worth the try because it’s a game that is very unique and presents gameplay elements that I have  never seen in a video game. The story is pretty straight forward and easy to understand, with the constant chilling soundtrack and entertaining puzzles this game really is outstanding. SuperLiminal isn’t a huge game it’s more of a experience, the second you get into it you instantly get hooked with its ways of puzzle solving and story telling. (4/5 Amazing) Your Missing Out!It\\'s an intelligently designed puzzles game with a script-writing simple in appearance but effective and uplifting. I was afraid about the game consisting only in changing the angle where you were looking at the pieces of the puzzle from as the only way to solve the proposed problems, however the game proposes that you have to change your point of view from time to time, as the way you solve problems will posit little but significant variations, so you must be open to think in different ways to beat it. It\\'s a bit short, about 5 hours long and, while it\\'s not especially difficult (there are more challenging puzzle games out there), there will be some puzzles that will make you turn off the Switch for some minutes or hours, be thinking about something completely different in hopes that the solution will come to you as inspiration comes in the middle of the night or during a stroll, which also happens! Also, the music is excellent and, without being experimental or oneiric (you\\'ll listen some cool jazz tunes mainly), completely matches the spirit of the game somehow. This is an experience I greatly recommend, in my opinion it\\'s a masterpiece of its genre. Just imagine it as a short version of Portal with different mechanics.\\n\\nThis is just a personal side note, but being the game set in your dreams, maybe it could have been more dream-like in some parts and that could have been quite pleasant, yet this dream of puzzles is still a supposedly controlled scientific experiment/product, so there\\'s not really a need for this plot wise.For me this was on par with the likes of Portal! It starts out as an innocent puzzle game, but slowly becomes much more. The puzzles are on a complete different level though as they explore with your visual perspective and really mess with your head. Had many moments where I had to pause because I was in absolute amazement at how I got fooled. Only reason it’s not a 10 for me is the price, as I beat this in about 2 to 3 hours. But if you’ve got the money I highly recommend.Very artsy game, but the gameplay is nothing special. It is more an interactive progressive experience, which it does extremely wellI don\\'t like this game, has really bad graphics and not enjoyable gameplay. Don\\'t go with this.Mediocre thrash metal that doesn\\'t deserve such high ratings. I don\\'t know how such a large number of players, in principle, can like such a talentless and negligent project.There are so many questions, and so few answers ... Can it stand above all other games?i don\\'t like the soundtrack. the game is not good and the graphics can be betterSuperliminal is a dreamy first-person puzzle game that plays with spatial perception and optical illusions.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\nEXTREMELY TRIPPY: If you\\'re looking for an oneiric, doors-of-perception kind of experience, it\\'s hard to imagine a better game to scratch that itch.\\n\\nUNIQUE CORE CONCEPT: I cannot think of any other  game that relies on the same idea of playing with perspective and your perception of scale.\\n\\nA FEW MEMORABLE SEQUENCES: One of the later levels pushes the idea of rescaling objects to interesting lengths, and results in a few moments that will probably stick with you.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nA FEW GOOD IDEAS, STRETCHED TOO THIN: Most puzzles are based on the same handful of good ideas. As the game progresses, those ideas get reused once too many times.\\n\\nSHAKY PERFORMANCE: The Switch struggles to keep a decent frame rate in some of the game\\'s environment.\\n\\nDRAGS ON TOWARDS THE END: The final level or two could have been a memorable acid trip, but their flow is spoiled by too many arbitrary riddles and annoying maze-like puzzles.This is a piece of art. Played this gem with a buddy of mine. We both enjoy a good puzzle game but this was just a whole different ballgame. Just pure class.One of the best puzzle games you can play. The mechanic the puzzles were using was just genious. Highly recommend it.\"Much like the original Portal, Superliminal won’t take too long to beat; however, the game does contain a lot of hidden content for you to hunt for, such as: hidden chess pieces, blueprints, and constellation rooms, all of which can be extremely tricky to find. What’s more, additional achievements can be unlocked for doing various things, including beating the game in an extremely tight thirty minutes. Whether or not these will incentivise you into replaying is down to your own personal preference, but I will certainly dip back in to try and complete everything.\"\\n\\nhttps://theeliteinstitute.net/2021/04/03/superliminal/Superliminal is a very strange experience from start to finish. For a puzzle game, it manages to throw a huge number of new toys and surprises at you in its relatively short play time. I found myself enjoying a ton of the mechanics so much that I would simply experiment around with them for a while, unaware of how long I\\'d spent interacting with one single object. With all that said, I would recommend getting the game during a sale because of how short it is.Nice chilled out game. Reminded me at times of The Stanley Parable, and some of the puzzles were reminiscent of Portal. One \"puzzle\" was a bit of a joke, and involved \"looking\" with the camera in a particular direction. It was so obtuse I had to look up the solution. But apart from that one ridiculous moment everything was pretty clear. My only real criticism would be that it was a little slow. All in all though I would recommend this game, it was a pleasurable (if short) game which I may very well return to in the future to try and collect the achievements I didn\\'t acquire on the first play through.An incredibly smart game with good gameplay and puzzles that make you go \"oh damn that\\'s cool\" every time you get past it, and a pretty good life lesson to boot, 10/10 would play again.',\n",
       " 'This game is just hard to forget. Ten years has passed since I\\'ve been playing for the first time, and the impressions, emotions are still with me. Those who had sad that it has a far greater story than Deus ex, are, as far as I am speaking for myself, correct. It needs that kind correction though, that the story in fact is a amazing book story, superior, to *any* game story, we have seen so far: including original Mafia story, or any good crpg, like Baldur\\'s Gate. It is far greater too, than a few good books, I ve been reading. But, eventually, it is not ony history told so good, but also the mechanics of the game, ideas hidden here and there, make this game, the best one out there. Everything if perfectly balanced.Well, it would be great to se a another game taking place in Planescepe environment someday. Let\\'s just hope it is possible.Planescape : Torment is philosophy for the video-gamer and undoubtedly has the best story ever to grace any computer game, Deus Ex included. You will have to be prepared to do a lot of reading in order to enjoy this profound tale. If you\\'ve ever come across the ideas of Nietzsche, Heidegger or Plato (and others, including Eastern philosophy and mysticism) you\\'ll be spooked out when you play this game. It is text heavy and in this respect plays much like an old-fashioned text-adventure but otherwise it plays the same as the other (also brilliant) Infinity Engine games : there\\'s a fair amount of combat plus plenty of quests and some of the weirdest and most wonderful locations, NPCs and enemies you\\'re every likely to come across. The level of interaction which is possible between party members and other NPCs is still unparalleled today. The artwork is wonderful and if you can muster the patience to get involved in the deepest game you will ever play you won\\'t notice that it\\'s all in low resolution. There is a widescreen mod available for this game, I believe. My co-favourite of all time along with the two Baldur\\'s Gates.I\\'ll start by saying this is my favorite video game of all time. The story in unarguably the best out of any video game, and better than the average stories in many other medias. The game does have its faults, mostly in slow combat / gameplay and bugs. But they are all negligible once you get engrossed in the story and characters, which are truly great. Every quest has multiple ways of beating it, and its one of the few RPGs that allow you to play a mostly passive character if you wish (with only a handful of \\'required\\' battles in the game.) This game does require a lot of reading, so if your in the mood for fun gameplay look elsewhere. But if youre looking for a truly remarkable role playing experience, you would be hard pressed to find any better than this.A timeless classic, and one of the pinnacles of gaming (not to mention the RPG genre). I played it many years ago, but I still remember how I was deeply impressed and moved by many of the situations the game managed to throw at you during your quest of self-discovery in an alien, highly allegorical world. The Sensate, for example, where one of the most interesting and well thought factions in a PC game, and the fact that the Planescape source material was extremely strong and imaginative surely helped. The characters were a sight to behold, with extremely detailed personalities and many ideological conflicts between them cleverly used by the game to furtherly emphasize the setting\\'s nuances.Definitely the best RPG of all time. The only negative point I can find is the combat, although it isn\\'t horrible. That one negative point does not manage to drag anything else down. Do not get it if you don\\'t like reading at all.You either quit playing this game after the first hour or get sucked into the planes. From the technician\\'s point of view it\\'s quite awful game. The story and characters are undoubtedly best of all video games ever made. Give it a shot. Maybe do not try to treat it as a video game, think of it as a story or even a \"book\".It\\'s stupid to write another review but it\\'s a generally well-known fact that I am a very stupid man so here we go: play this game, you dork. It\\'s much better than the crap you\\'re currently spending time on.Some people choose super mario as their nostalgic game of choice, some people sonic, others some obscure nes game. Me? Planescape torment is up there, right next to the original deus ex. And it even holds up today. Why? It has a truly unique world, populated with truly unique characters. And while this can be said about fallout - for instance, this stands alone. It is, and was - truly it\\'s own inspiration. Original ideas are rare, and when you back them up with a game of supurb depth and length - and you are left with nothing but praise and awe. Better than dragon age origins and baldur\\'s gate 2 both of which I consider masterpieces. That\\'s how good planescape torment was, and is even today. And while deus ex remains a game I enjoyed more - this comes very close to taking every crown there is. 10/10, 100/100, 999/1000Stop playing your Dragon Age 2s and your Call of Duty 17s, with the Pokemon and the jello pudding, and PLAY THIS GAME.Seeing as how every review before me has already said this, I will redundantly add that this is *the* best RPG (re: game of any kind) that has ever been made. Make this game *known* to you. I will would literally spend my entire fortune and kill a homeless person to see a developer take up the monumental task of remaking of this game for the 21st century. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS? BUY THIS GAME.To me Planescape: Torment is pinnacle of storytelling in gaming. It has funny, personal and powerful story of identity, memory and redemption. It lacks in sheer playability and smoothness, but these do not cripple its might at all. To me Dak\\'kon of Skrathlor, Morte, The Transcendent One and others just as important characters than Tifa, Barret or Sephiroth.The Nameless One (YOU) wakes at morgue. Its labourers are are rotten undead and your only guide about anything is snarky skull. So you set out to Sigil (city everywhere and nowhere) in quest to find about yourself. And you can\\'t die, so something must be amiss. And it is and in matters you (PLAYER) can only imagine. AND IT IS AWESOME.This game is great. Story about amnesiac immortal breaks down all cliches of genre and in addition it is covered with beautiful graphics, magnificent sound and completeley adequate playability. This game was not designed not to be fighting, but more about searching, learning and finally accepting what is true. Voice-acting has skilled names doing awesome roles and characters they play are real. Even snarky skull Morte is more than it seemsa, but he still is snarky skull. And in addition to this lovable coward you face zerth Dak\\'kon, succubus (she is chaste, prim and proper) Fall-From-Grace, tiefling Annah with most sexy scottish accent and insane Ignus- living and ecstatic conduit to Plane of Fire. All these and several more weirdos are just gravy on top of story, which ends in thoroughly epic (and nively smoothly played) Grande Finale.Planescape: Torment is not about great AI of party members, smooth combat against hordes of goblins  or about facing insane madman who just happens to be King of Highland. Planescape: Torment is great novel told in despised format of gaming and delivers sheer Art. Even though it is crude as game, it is amgnificent as story. In my eyes encounter between The Nameless One and The Transcendent One is just as epic as any other final boss.This game is not a masterpiece. It is The Masterpiece. And I took no pleasure in its appearance.Planescape: Torment was one of the first RPGs I played. And sadly, it ruined the genre for me. \"WHAT? How can such a classic ruin the genre for you! You complete numpty!\", you might be thinking. Well, it didn\\'t ruin RPGs for me because it was bad. Quite the opposite in fact. Torment is simply so good, that every RPG afterwards has been rather hum-drum in comparison. I\\'m sure that part of the reason is that Torment was one of my first forays into the wonderful world of (W)RPGs, but the game really is one of the classics.The main reason is that the story, the setting, the characters and the atmosphere of the game are all unparalleled. This is not a tale of kings and queens, of lands that need to be saved or of damsels that need to de-stress after their distress. You\\'re not the saviour, not the chosen one and, most of the time, not much of a hero either. This tale is a personal tale. It tells the story of an apparently immortal man who has no idea who he is, where he is or how he ended up not being able to die. In his journey for answers you meet a host of rather interesting characters and companions (a talking skull, an empty suit of armour and a chaste succubus among others) and you slowly discover hints about your past and why you ended up the way you did. An amnesiac main character isn\\'t very original, (how many books and films have employed the same trick? I can\\'t remember. Hmmm) but it is the way the story is told that makes it so engaging. The game implies instead of explains and leaves the player to fill in blanks, which makes the tale all the more engaging. The setting is delightfully weird and a breath of fresh air for people sick of the enormous deluge of RPGs set in a faux-medieval, faux-european faux-fantasy land. In this game, no elfs in sight! No dwarves either, not even when you look down!  The game takes place, for the most part, in the city of Sigil, the city of Doors and the centre of existence. Here you can take portals to all the known and unknown planes. If you can find the right key, that is. Belief is power in the City of Doors and the power of belief manifests in reality. Get enough people to belief in your idea and see it come to pass, lose the belief of your people and even Gods might as well be dead.Yeah, yeah, the game spins a grand tale. We get it! How about the rest? The nitty-gritty, the meat and potatoes? In short, the combat? Well, the setting, story and characters are really the main strenghts of the game. This is a game to play if you like a good story, a different world and if you enjoy reading. Do your preferences lean more towards the combat side of games, then this title is not for you.There is combat in the game, reminiscent of games like Baldur\\'s Gate and Icewind Dale, but it feels sluggish and gets boring quickly. The combat spell effects are rather special though, so playing as a mage will give you some graphical satisfaction during combat.Graphically, the isometric 2D view works well for the game, and the detailed and colourful backgrounds are beautiful, even more than ten years later. The music and sound effects have also held up well and add to an already impressively atmospheric game.In short, Planescape:Torment is an absolute classic for its storyline, setting and atmosphere and deserves to be played by anyone interested in a story-driven game. Combat is not the game\\'s strong point, so action fanatics may pass this one up. Well, you should still try it just so you can say you played it, but you probably won\\'t like it all that much.The best story ever told.The most influential RPG ever.The best RPG ever.The most intriguing main character to play with.The most interesting NPC character stories ever told.Enigmatic atmosphere and beautiful musical background done by Mark Morgan made this game specific and flawless.But the most important thing that makes this game unique is novel-like conversation system.Which gives this  game soul,and distinction from other games.There\\'s only One,not Many.Not Baldurs Gate,nor Fallout,nor Icewind Dale,nor Morrowind,nor DIablo or any other.There\\'s only One.And i qoute:\\'\\' What can change the nature of a man?\\'\\'People are still reviewing this? Good. Because this is not a game for ignoring, this is a game to be revelled in, to be celebrated. There is not much to add to what\\'s already been written. I have to mention the characters in this game though - they are truly wonderful. I can still quote from all of them and it\\'s about 4 years since I played. Recalling the music isn\\'t a problem either. How many games that you\\'ve played have that effect on you? Not many I\\'d guess. This game stands alone. Absolutely. Brilliant.I haven\\'t come across a game with more depth. The number of characters and the length of their dialogues are incredible. Laconic, touched, witty, smarmy and demented replies are all accepted, but not always given good marks.   Your incarnation of The Nameless One, one of a vast number of permutations to make his way through the Planescape, meets other lost or downtrodden wanderers, amiable or suspicious enough to accompany him on his journey. Even these characters have vast ideologies and backgrounds to explore and will often grant you boons in return for your interest.   The attributes system grants points to each character as they gain experience. These points are allocated among traits: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. Each character will limit him/herself in various aspects: ability to wear armour types or wield weapons, carrying capacity, capability of combat styles, magical knowledge, casting adeptness, dialogue choices and persuasiveness. It\\'s up to you to decide how useful or fitting these abilities are to fighters, mages, thieves or priests.   The items picked up, stolen or crafted range from bog-standard to fantastical: weapons, armor or profound tattoos, that grant certain individuals additional attributes when worn; staple potions, radical medical curatives and pica chews; obscure artifacts, works of art and religious icons, usable only by certain theological alignments.   Trying to comprehend how the game was written absolutely boggles the mind. A collection of interwoven worlds with plenty of obscure, tangential areas. Enough to stretch the length of gameplay to absurd levels.I made account here just to give 10 to this masterpiece. One of the best games ever made. I prefer BG II to Planescape, but in my opinion PS:T has better story. What is the nature of man? Immortal lover, immortal killer, neverending pain and torment - this game is a philosophical masterpiece.Over a decade later, and I can safely say this for role-playing games (and perhaps all games): they just don\\'t make them like they used to.  I played Planescape: Torment when I was much younger and could not grasp much of its complexity.  I return to it now and see that it is, without a doubt, the best RPG I have played so far.  The story is profound and mind-bending, as are all the characters in it.  Through many a dialogue did I feel genuinely moved, awed, or chilled to the bone.  What\\'s more, the gameplay is open-ended and relies on you being resourceful.  It does not hold your hand, it does not walk you through tutorials--NO!  Like the Nameless One, you wake in a cold, dark world with nothing, not even your memories, and you must go forth to solve the mystery of YOURSELF using your wits and what few scraps you have.  Combat is the same way.  It forces you to constantly change your strategies and take advantage of the many spells, skills, and items you acquire along the way.  At the same time, you are required to concentrate on the dialogue in order to puzzle out the various clues you collect throughout your journey.  Torment is so well-written, however, that it unfolds like a darkly poetic novel.  Ultimately, if you put enough thought and energy into Planescape: Torment, it comes to life in an extraordinary way.  Few games (if any) can compare.  It was definitely worth the hours of finagling it took to get this old masterpiece running on my modern desktop.I\\'ve never seen another game like this after I first played it. The closet I ever got was Fate Stay/Night and other Japanese visual novels with English subtitles.The story, as described by others, is phenomenal. The characters are bonded to the protagonist, and thus to the player. True role playing, not in the sense that the player gets to decide to write up a backstory that the CRPG doesn\\'t even know exist, but to role play as the protagonist in a story someone else write especially for this CRPG. The graphics in a lot of ways is aesthetically more pleasing than Baldur\\'s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter Nights. You can see a lot of details and each character has a large enough sprite slot that the animation is smooth and the combat actions are true. In BG, half of your characters look the same and have no \"artistic identity\". But here, there is a pure difference between all the NPCs and the main protagonist.This game is the second best game of all times(after Baldurs Gate 2).And it also has the best scenario and the most impresive philosofical questions that you can find in any game or in any book.And I say that after I have read a lot of books of Plato,Xenophon and Aristotelis so I know what I am talking about.Life and Death,Ideology and Social Views,Love and Friendship,Hope and Despair,Wisdom and Madness all fight an eternal war for the soul of the protagonist.If you have a computer that can play the game without bugs play it.It will be the experience of a lifetime for you.Simply one of the best games ever created... there are no rpgs today that reach the level of depth of this game... This is one of the game that you have to play before you die!To be sincere... never played it! But my boyfriend is a big fan (in fact is his favourite game)... so... I can say (instead of him) that the game looks pretty good and the story interesting. Well... I was not talking in his words... he\\'d say TOTALLY RECOMENDED... AMAZING... THRILLING... of course if you\\'re the kind of person who loves reading even if the story takes you 1h and a half... you\\'d love this one.Best role playing game...ever! The incredible story is unrivaled by most RPGs except the few elite ones out there. I played this game back when it was released and it was overshadowed by the more combat oriented Baldur\\'s Gate series (amazing game as well). You have to experience this game to realize how good it is. Graphics are dated but the wonderful artwork coupled with mods that improve resolution make this game still a beautiful game to play.Worth for players that never experience non-3D graphics.I don\\'t see how anything can surpass this game. The combat and the UI are both less than stellar, so I can see why some would complain though I myself didn\\'t find it that bad. The story however, along with the characters and to a lesser extent the setting, is enough to raise it above every other game I\\'ve played. I just hope they never try to remake this!Strong, unique narrative and a few interesting philosophical concepts, but it\\'s not quite enough to totally overshadow the lame combat system and poor balancing of character attributes.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Story, a lot of depth, perspective varies depending on player actions\\n-Dialogue trees\\n-Several joinable factions, and a number of alignments based on player actions\\n-Artwork, setting\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-Combat is pointless and uninteresting (also rare)\\n-Game is unbalanced... Strength, dexterity and constitution attributes are useless. Wisdom unlocks most dialogue options, with a few options being unlocked by intelligence and charisma. Mage class is 10000x stronger than your other options due to the above reasons\\n-A few bugs, most can be fixed with unofficial patches, but a couple quest-breaking bugs persistChances are you didn\\'t land on the page of Torment  Planescape by coincidence, not in 2013. And you probably know what kind of game type it is. So just try this game.\\n\\nAnd good news if you like it, a new Torment game got funded and is under development^^This game is a masterpiece. One of the best CRPGs of all time (if not the best). The setting is very original. The story is just great. All the characters are memorable and unique. The quests are good as well. The game is still awesome since it came out in 1999, every new walkthrough opens some new details about the story. So if you are into CRPGs you MUST play this!Brought to my attention by PC Gamer, I do not regret at all buying it. The story in depth and expansive, and is truly choice oriented. The art style and sprite based animations fills me with nostalgia. I am playing it for the first time, 14 years after its release, and it seems to have aged very well. THE best top down RPG ever made, and argueably one of the best games ever made.The short version is that it\\'s the best game ever made.\\n\\nThe long version... it\\'s an Infinity Engine game, which means 2D graphics in isometric view, similar to Baldur\\'s Gate, and very low resolution. It also means that it is difficult to get this game to run on a modern machine. Do some googling for fan-made patches (which can also fix the low resolution), but even with those the game is finicky.\\nIt\\'s a role-playing game based on Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Ed., in the Planescape setting (which WotC later abandoned), but the producers intentionally set out to break every role playing game cliche in the book. Stay your hand, talk to people, even creatures you\\'d in other games kill without a second\\'s hesitation - in *this* game it might be a lost friend with clues to your past.\\n\\nPlanescape: Torment is something as unusual in gaming as a tragedy: you guide a small band of remarkable but ragged and broken individuals in the hard and unforgiving Planes, you watch friendship and love grow, but as the iron logic of the story unfolds you, the player, soon realize that there can be no happy end to this tale. However, while tragedies don\\'t have happy endings, they do pack massive emotional punch and grant the viewer catharsis - and Planescape: Torment is an oh-so-very good tragedy.\\n\\nSome don\\'t like the slow pace, the bizarre setting, the reams of text or the clunky combat, but if you\\'re lucky and can immerse yourself in this game, then you\\'re in for an experience which will stay with you for the rest of your life.One of my all time favorites, if you want a unique RPG with a great story, this is for you.  The protagonist is unforgettable , the NPCs are some of the best of all time (up there with BG/BG2), and the environment is amazing.  The graphics are dated even with recent patches to increase the resolution, but it\\'s absolutely worth playing.\"What can change the nature of a man?\"  That\\'s the question the protagonist must ultimately answer.  Thus begins a journey into the strange, profound, and heart-wrenching.  I played this as a teenager and the story still haunts me to this day.  If someone makes a sequel, I sincerely hope they will treat it with the utmost respect as homage to the original.I played this game for the 1st time in 2012.....13 years since it was released. I can easily say this the best story in video games i have experienced and it even matches up to some pretty great stories in famous books. With memorable companions,intriguing plot, believable n fully fleshed NPCs and an amazing protagonist, this is a epic story for the ages. Gamers who like high amount of action in games may not like this one as it involves a lot of reading, but those who invest in the story and have patience will derive unparalleled joy. Planescape: Torment - My favourite game forever. If eligible for the Oscar\\'s you would have swept most categories. I salute the developers and thank them for creating this masterpiece. A Timeless ClassicI played this Game in the year 2012. This is game is amazing. If i should rate this game on release date it would be a 11 but now im giving it a 10. if you like rpgs with cool characters, a very nice story and your focus is not on combat. dude GET THIS!!I still look back on my time with this game as my happiest gaming moments in the era after I was old enough to not like everything.  This game changed my mental landscape and the way my imagination works.  I want to get addicted to whatever the developers were on.Along with Baldurs Gate 2, this is the pinnacle of cRPGs. Better story than BG2 but less combat/exploration. All time classic. As i said in BG2, wish they still made games like this...The best of the infinite engine games in terms of roleplaying (REAL roleplaying, not a game with a level-based progression system, more story then an action game typically has, with a bunch of empty choices). You\\'re given a blank slate and are free to develop them however you wish, with your choices in game actually mattering, starting with your basic stats. In the other infinite engine games, there\\'s few minimum stat requirements for dialog or quest options, making mental stats largely a waste, while physical stats, even for casters are usually the best stats. Not so in Torment....every action you take generally has some degree of minimum requirement involved. While a combat focused character can beat the game, they will have a DRAMATICALLY different experience from a more cerebral character would. This is actually largely a part of the setting. In the outer planes, reality is more malleable then on more stabilized prime worlds, allowing things as simple as believing in something enough (or enough people believing in it) to make it happen. This lends itself to a more thought provocting story. Though I will go ahead and acknowledge that the game play might not be for everyone. If you\\'re more interested in combat or dungeon crawling, Baldur\\'s Gate (equal balance on story and combat) or Icewind Dale (Dungeon Crawler with minimal story) might be more up your alley. However if a quality roleplaying experience is what you want, Torment does it best. There are actually very few games that can even rival it in those terms (mostly just Fallout 1 and 2, which are very similar in quality, though using a different overall system).There\\'s simply nothing that matches this game in terms of the story and characters. I\\'ve spend last 5 days playing this game, what a ride! I\\'m thinking to give it another play through soon. I\\'m wishing this game HD remake or something. of course you can play it with mods widescreen bug fixes etc... all good. But this game deserve overhaul. I\\'m not old school rpg baldur\\'s gate icewind dale fan, and i\\'m telling you this game is amazing, but if you are, this will probably fit you even more.\\nYou deserve to play this game, this game deserve to be played, that is the nature of this game!They just dont make games like this anymore. It has the BEST story in a videogame of all times. And what makes this game the best is that it is the only one where choice does matter. In other games the biggest choice you have to make is generally being good or evil which is extremly predictable. Here it takes a whole new spin. Here when you start a conversation you dont know where its heading, which talking option is the best. And here stats matter. If you have strength you can intimidate people, if you are dexterous you might catch a npc pickpocketing you, there are also endless options available trough intelligence, wisdom or charisma. No more dump stats as in Baldurs Gate. I am playing baldurs gate 2 now and while it is a great game and the combat aspect is better than planescape is lacks that thrill of the story and the choice.\\n\\nProbably best videogame ever. Pity it had sold so little back in the day.Hands down the best story of any video game ever. I kinda want to say of any book I have ever read as well but it was interactive so I guess it just doesn\\'t fall into the category though it borderlines it as well. Planescape: Torment is my favorite video game of all time and literally the only game to ever invoke an positive emotional response beyond that was awesome or cool. At the end I was literally so happy about how well the game played and about the ending I had a tear to my eye. Literally the only piece of media I have experienced in my life that has ever evoked a tear from the mix of sadness and happiness.\\n\\nCombat\\'s not perfect but IDGAF the rest of the game from music to customization outshines it. The combat is even somewhat unnecessary and yet it still has all the character building available should you choose to go that route. I think it is impossible to to be disappointed by this game.Let\\'s make things clear: this is the best RPG I have ever played. Yes, other games have improved on its flaws ever since, because it does have flaws (otherwise I would rate it at 10,) but it was the game changer when it was released and, being one of the very few games I replay once in a while, it is still more enjoyable than 90% of whatever has been released since.\\n\\nFirst, and not foremost, the writing is simply superb. I have been playing Dungeons & Dragons since the 70s (yes, even old farts can enjoy video games,) and if there ever was one universe that left me completely indifferent in AD&D, that was the Planescape universe, which on paper sounded like the epitome of what I would dislike. PS Torment brilliantly showed me an example of what terrific atmosphere I could extract from this very unusual setting.\\n\\nMore relevantly, because not based on P&P experience but compared to the computer games of the time, Torment was the first RPG that made it worth playing a wise or charismatic character. Before that, every RPG expected you to play a physical character, i.e., a warrior with high Strength and Endurance. Until then, nobody knew what to do with other traits.\\n\\nMaybe it sounds like I\\'m saying it was the best RPG and that the rating is dated. Well, there might be some truth in it, and I reply it still is a valid rating on that sole basis, but you know what ? It hasn\\'t changed that much. Take the modern Fallout franchise, pretty good games if you ask me, but all they do is reverse the trend. In Fallout 3 or NV, or (outside of Fallout) Wasteland 2, or whatever, the stat you really want to raise is your Intelligence if you care about numbers and optimising your build. That\\'s nice and all, but if 1 stat is more important than the others, at the end of the day, this is what you had before PS Torment. So yes, even by today\\'s standards, the stats mechanics are seldom matched. I have played Torment as a stupid barbarian, and it still was great fun. Very few games have pushed that envelope since then.\\n\\nOkay, so groundbreaking mechanics, broadened play styles  and terrific writing. That should be enough, right ? But don\\'t forget the interface of the IE engine. That interface was one of the best at the time, and still stands the test of time. It is the model that has been built upon. RPGs felt so clunky before. Take the main competition of the day, Fallout and its sequel. True, they are in any way as creative and enthralling as Torment, but what good is it when their interface is so hopelessly bad that playing them becomes a chore ? You do need both to reach greatness, and PS Torment did have both. Still has, seriously. Play it today, it didn\\'t get old.\\n\\nNow let\\'s spend a minute with the real competition, Baldur\\'s Gate, which also aged very well (At least BG2. BG1 isn\\'t bad but is quite boring if you ask me.) BG improved on the companions. It also introduced romances, which are just fluff to me, but important for many players. That\\'s it. Torment has the best story and protagonist by far. Also less cosmetic the choices. Also just plain awesome. I\\'m being pedantic anyway: if you like any one of the IE engine games, try all of them.\\n\\nVery unusual that I spend so much time on a game\\'s qualities, when flaws are so much easier to point at. All right, here is one, common to all IE games: combat isn\\'t great, and comes in nonsensical quantities. Actually, today\\'s games still do that, which means that someone, either players or devs, expect it. Anyway, few battles are memorable. On the other hand, many tactics are completely valid, even cheesy ones, so there is still a lot of fun to be had there.\\n\\nA groundbreaking masterpiece. And if you don\\'t care about ancient ground breakers, you still have a masterpiece.What can be written that has not been said a hundred times before me (777 to be precise).\\nThe game explores fundamental questions that we as humans oftentimes dare not explore ourselves. Instead, you are sent on a plague-ridden, hardship-sown adventure of finding yourself and your identity. During this journey, you will explore the depths of your own fragility -or in that regard, indestructibility-. Experiences such as I have never faced in my life have happened to me during playing this game. One of them involved falling down from a chair in utter shock; I felt shaken to my core (readers familiar with a certain old man with a staff might know what I am hinting at); absolutely befuddled, and charmed beyond reprieve. As my 10 years younger brother stated once he finished the game: \"Planescape Torment is not a game, it is a literally masterpiece.\" I do not disagree...\\nThe game faces the fundamental question: \"What can change the nature of a man?\"\\nI have to tell you: I don\\'t know the answer to this question, but one thing I know for sure: Planescape Torment can.Good:\\n-It still has the best story ever written in the last thirty years\\n-Unbelievable party\\'s characterization\\n-Unforgettable world\\n-Best dialogues ever\\n**** up side quests\\n-Good soundtrack\\n-Long\\n\\nBad:\\n-Man, those fights suck!\\n-The section between Ravel and Trias is too much umbalanced\\n\\n9Planescape: Torment is an amazing game and the first CRPG I have ever played. The world is magical. It has the atmosphere that reminds me the cyberpunk genre. The game is not very hard, it was challenging at times but in the end I always beat the encounters when I think of a strategy. It has been a year since I completed the game but I still now every character and plotelement, and every aspect is amazing of it.\\n\\nThe game\\'s main flaw is probably it\\'s combat. I would call it clunky, it\\'s not gamebreakingly bad but it can be frustrating to play with it.\\n\\nThe music, composed by Mark Morgan, fits the atmosphere very well and is in my opinion very good.\\n\\nThe graphics are of course outdated since this game is from 1999, but again, I think it fits the atmosphere and creates some sort of enigmatic experience.This game is seriously awesome. It has probably the best story i\\'ve ever seen in a game, which is partly due to the fact that the hero isnt your typical make the sun shine and everyone hold hands and sing at the end type of guy. If you\\'re looking for an rpg with some originality, great humor, and one hell of a story, pick this up.This is one of the few games that was exactly as good as everyone told me it would be. Torment is the best RPG ever made, hands down.\\n\\nThe strength of this game is in its writing. The quality of writing that Torment has is unparalleled by any game ever made. The story is incredibly well crafted and memorable. Nothing more needs to be said about it.\\n\\nThough combat isn\\'t the focus of the game, with peaceful ways out of most situations, the combat is still great. Simple as far as CRPGs go, making it a great first CRPG for beginners, there are 3 classes you can play as, each with a lot of depth and a unique way of playing. Each experience is fun, to be sure, and it encourages replays of the game, but first time players should definitely play as a Mage with max Int and Wis to get the most out of the game their first time.\\n\\nGraphics and sound hold up fine, even today. They get the job done and they do it well, and they have a certain charm to them that will be memorable for a long time to come.\\n\\nAtmosphere is also top notch. No game, save for Dark Souls, has ever made me feel like I was really in an alien and strange world to this extent before, not even Morrowind. The world is also incredibly well designed, faithfully adapting the incredible Planescape D&D setting to a video game.\\n\\nAlthough a lot of content was unfortunately cut, particularly in the later areas, there is still a tremendous amount of things to do. This is where the real replay value comes: There are tons, and I do mean TONS, of meaningful choices to make, with consequences often follow you into the late game. There are also no quest markers to hold your hand, and this trust of the player\\'s ability to figure out what to do will be very refreshing for new players and returning players alike.\\n\\nAll in all, Planescape is a masterpiece of a game, a must play for anyone who likes real RPGs or thinks they might. For new players, once you get past the isometric view and a few cheesy things here and there you will find this game just as enjoyable as it was 20 years ago. Highly recommended, especially as a first CRPG.The world view of this game is crazy. There is more depth of story than any game I\\'ve ever played. It feels like I read a novel book. The battle is really trashy, but except for that, I am proud of immense immersion.One of the best RPGs for the entire existence of the genre.In terms of studying characters and dialogs, perhaps the best.One of the best rpgs ever\\n\\neven if the original creators banded up again they couldnt have made a game like this again. If you havent played this and deus ex the original 2000 game then throw your controller break your console,throw your pc out of the window and go fishing. Unless you suck at fishing in which case i pity you fooThis is the best written computer game. Story, setting, and DnD character and alignment system blend perfectly. Everything is connected the world of this game. After I played Planescape: Torment, my ability to enjoy other, inferior, RPGs was severely diminished. Infinity engine combat system was flawed, but with the importance the game places on dialogues dominating the importance of combat, flaws of combat can be neglected.Finished. It was great. I still can\\'t believe I haven\\'t heard of it before. The story was incredible, the only game that has a story like PST is The Witcher 2, and that\\'s it. Though the combat could be stupid at times, the dialogues and the story far make up for It.Planescape Torment is a masterpiece of work in RPG video game genre. The characters, individually, are among the best you will encounter in a game and all are with deep backstories and interesting personality and The massive amount of dialog used to present its story. Dialog trees stretch sometimes up to 10+ options, each with several subcategories, and with several more sub-sub categories. Those dialog lines often will take quite some time to absorb which is why this game is not as popular as Baldur\\'s Gate series. The story in this game is incredibly good. You play the game as a character that can never be killed and nameless. What you do in the game is to discover who you were, why things are happening, and what to do next, so you are truly role play a Character as you want to be. Although it did a tremendous job on story telling, the gameplay in this game falls a bit short. The pacing in this game is too slow and since you can not die, it really take a lot fun from the game itself. So overall it\\'s a 9 out 10, I like Baldur\\'s Gate 2 betterAfter so many ears i still easily find myself loading up my saved games just to bring up certain interactions between the characters. I must have at least played the game 5 times now. It is one of those story that will stay with you even after many years, sort of like cult classics such as Highlander 1, Back To The Future Trilogy, Batman Begins etc. Its a shame that the newer graphic cards do not support certain part of the game such as spell-casting.Planescape Torment, if it were a film, ut would be Citizen Kane or Ben Hur. If it were a book, it would be War and Peace, or something by Shakespeare. It is, by far, the most artistic, mature, creative story ever penned in any media. It has characters that have the deepness of life-long friends, it has more emotion than a Rocky film and does all this in a way that makes reading enjoying again, with immersion that takes you to another world like no book or movie has done before. It is a work of art and will be remembered for as long as anyone who has played it is still alive on this planet. It is, of course, the greatest game ever published, on any format. If you have not bought this game, do so, challenge yourself, stretch your mind. You will never be the same person again and you will know yourself better than you did before playing it. It is that profound an experience to play.The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.Easily the finest, most engrossing, most brilliant conceived game ever made. Flawless, and almost painfully intelligent.PST is possibly the greatest game of any genre ever made, and aside from the Baldur\\'s Gate Saga, it\\'s the best RPG bar none. The game unfortunately suffered from lack of publicity upon its release, so it didn\\'t get the recognition it truly deserved.\\n\\nLet loose in \\'99, many people are just learning about this masterpiece. I can\\'t understand anyone giving this game a negative score, but as I\\'ve said before in my reviews, you cannot please everyone, and all are entitled to their opinion. I for one however cannot give this game anything lower than a perfect 10, and if I could rate it higher, I would without ado.\\n\\nPST was way ahead of its time, and it shows in every aspect of the game. The story is one of the best I\\'ve ever experienced in any game, ever. To think you wake up in a morgue not knowing who you are or how you got there is creepy and intriguing. Then little by little, you have to piece the puzzle together. This game will make you laugh, make you cry and maybe even give you nightmares. It\\'s that good.\\n\\nDespite there is just TNO (the nameless one) as the main protagonist, the game has a lot of replay value. This is mostly due to the multiple ways in which you can complete quests, how you treat people through dialogue, and of course the alignment modifier. You can be good, but treat enough people poorly, and you could end up chaotic or even evil. TNO starts as a fighter, but you have choices later to become a mage or a thief, and even switch back and forth as much as you wish (not recommended). There are also factions you can join, tattoos, romance, the list goes on and on. Probably the greatest part of PST is TNO cannot die. He\\'s immortal. Oh sure, he can still be killed, but the final death can never take him. That\\'s a huge plus in my book. No more loading a saved game just because your character got whacked.\\n\\nA word of warning however... The game is very dialogue intensive. This may be the reason some don\\'t like it, but its necessary for the story. PST is a game to take your time with and not rush. If you do, you\\'ll miss out on a lot. Talk to everyone, search every nook and cranny, be patient and have fun. 10/10.Planescape: Torment deserves its place on the top, or very near the top, of every best RPGs list. Black Isle Studios, the titans of Dungeons & Dragons CRPGs, turned convention on its head when they crafted this Planar adventure. There are no more typical fantasy races, morality is not defined, or is at least mutable, and every character attribute is tied to conversations and out of combat actions. It’s a game of philosophy and discovery rather than a monster slaying adventure.\\n\\n“What can change the nature of a man?” is the question at the heart of Planescape: Torment. The Nameless One is an immortal amnesiac, living many lives, doing deeds terrible and great, changing the lives of those around him, often for the worst. Waking up on a mortuary slab, the mystery of his past propels the Nameless One through the Multiverse, one of the most bizarre settings of any RPG, where he deals with Gods, zealotic factions – like the Dustmen, a faction that believes life is a fleeting precursor to the ultimate existence: death - and mazes both mechanical and magical.\\n\\nThe ambition of Planescape: Torment would have been for naught were it not for the superb writing that accompanied it. Chris Avellone and Co penned a tale saturated with nuance and memorable characters that, even 14 years on, stands the test of time and has yet to be outdone. It’s the only RPG where you\\'ll find yourself searching through the protagonist’s organs to find an important item, or where you may allow an NPC to kill you so that she could experience what it would be like to murder somebody. And all the while you\\'ll wrestled with philosophical conundrums and questions of identity. If that all sounds a bit grisly and esoteric to you, then fret not, as the Nameless One is also accompanied by a floating, talking skull who is an unrepentant flirt and have a thing for zombies, so it’s not all serious.What is there to say about this game except that it was a tragedy that it was not a commercial success.  It is, simply put, the best RPG ever made.  It is by no means for everyone; it is a gamer\\'s game. It is for people who want to think...even meditate...about their gaming experience.  There is no shoot-em up. There are no friends for you to play with it. There is no world to save.  It contradicts just about everything that modern gaming has become. It is a masterpiece.Torment is THE game for any person who gain any enjoyment from philosopical, theological and deeply horrifying thoughts. That is, any person with any intelligent thoughts what-so-ever. Play this game and if you are not one of the stupid people in this world you will, and must, LOVE this game.Simply astonishing, totally unmatched experience. ten years after the release some of the interface and mechanics could leave a feel that there could be improvements, but the game IS the story and the characters, and that are still fantastic!Intellectually sating, emotionally riveting, totally immersive and immensely atmospheric. Game creators, take heed! This is the stuff that dreams are made of.The best RPG to have come out, and still 8 years later as deeply etched in one\\'s very soul as to bring a lump in my throat just thinking about how great it is. Lovable, affectionate characters, a dark, emphatic storyline and a tremendously philosophical, imaginative storyline - it is, in my mind, unchallenged at the very top, though some games have tried for the new top dog. If you like games that really immerse you in every sense of the word, you will love this one for the rest of your days.This game is still on my list of best games I have ever played. The game is near perfect and the ending will stay with you forever. Only game that brought a tear to my eye. Ever. such a wonderful and thought provoking game.This game has among the best story/setting among video games. There\\'s a great amount of attention given to setting details, and strong characterization from all of the party NPCs. Not everything gets explained to you all the time, and it leaves you with the feeling that you\\'re one person in a larger world that\\'s moving along with or without you.\\n\\nThe downsides of the game are that, considering that the game is largely about dialog options and how you talk to people and so forth, the game itself won\\'t tell you most of the time when your stats have given you a special dialog option, or your lack of stats have prevented you from picking an option. You have to read a guide to know any of that. Special dialog options being labeled didn\\'t really become popular until some later RPGs that came after this one.\\n\\nAlso, the game is an Infinity Engine game, so naturally you have to vaguely understand the 2nd edition ADnD rules to get what\\'s going on some of the time (same as Baldur\\'s Gate or Icewind Dale). Ehhhh. I know how the combat system works from playing the table-top game and Baldur\\'s Gate, so it doesn\\'t bother me too much, but I could easily see how it might hold back someone who was otherwise unfamiliar with it and just wanted to play an RPG with a strong story element.\\n\\nIf you like RPGs that go in the direction of grinding for levels and stat building and so on, then this game isn\\'t gonna be your thing. A few fights are hard, but most of the time if you just fight things that show up then you can just get through everything that\\'s a fight without much trouble. The game doesn\\'t even have much in the way of fights compared to most other RPGs. There\\'s a lot of talking and doing stuff \"in town\" instead of \"in dungeons\".\\n\\nIf you like character based RPGs with lots of story, this game is exactly what you\\'re looking for. A party full of interesting characters, and nice setting and quests that are a little unusual for fantasy, but not so unusual that you can\\'t follow along with what\\'s happening.An absolute masterpiece, hands down the best computer RPG made so far. Intricate story and dialogue that easily surpasses most fantasy novels. Probably still makes writers of this recent Dragon Age type garbage rock in a fetal position and cry. Personal and complex characters, great atmosphere. A desktop & iOS remake seems likely now with Baldur\\'s Gate: EE coming 2012 and hopefully this undervalued diamond will get the attention it deserves.If you said this is the best game ever made, I would not argue with you.  It is hard to name a better game.  This game reminds us of a time when developers cared about games like they were works of art (now, they make games designed to extract money by microtransactions and DLC).  Play this game.If I had to pick the best example of video game art, this is it. Truly unforgettable! One of the best narratives in gaming, intriguing setting, wonderful soundtrack and atmosphere, very well developed characters that one cannot help but empathize with them and their struggles. What can change the nature of a man? Not only is the journey to find the answer to this of great importance to TNO, the themes and philosophical questions make it so for the player as well.The apex of RPG writing.  There is no other game where your decisions matter so much, where the world is so rich, where the characters are so compelling...  I have been a pretty serious gamer for my entire 30 years and I am hard pressed to think of a game that has stuck with me the way Planescape: Torment has.  If I tried to name what I think is my favorite game of all time from all genres... that\\'s a difficult question, but this is certainly the best Single-Player RPG I have ever played, and I have played many.The deepest, most mature, most complex and the most incredible story ever told in a game? This is one of those titles that felt like something much more than a game, a piece of art. Greatest works of literature are running away in shame when they see Planescape: Torment. The unique world and characters are just so special, they give you the experience you will never forget and plant a question inside your head, that you will be thinking about even decades later - What can change the nature of a man? 10/10What can change the nature of a man?\\nThis game throws the standards out the window. What is the usual end of your journey in any rpg related game? Death. That is not the case at all here, in fact you cannot die!\\nThat, however, doesn\\'t mean a free ride through the game.\\nStorytelling at its finest. Planescape: Torment is not just a game. It\\'s a journey into a whole new universe. It is so unique, it doesn\\'t get repetitive at any point, although its hack&slash combat style is very simple, it\\'s still fun, and very story-connected.  I\\'m rooting for the sequel to meet the expectations, and resuscitate the D&D RPGs. There has not been a game with story so memorable since.\\nHats off to Mr. Avellone for giving us this title.\\n11/10*know* that this game will change everything. After you play it there is no going back, your standard for CRPGs, RPGs and games as a whole. This is the test, if you can\\'t finish it, don\\'t give it a bad review for your lack of taste.… ExpandThe peak of storytelling in video games. A truly immersive, beautifully crafted, emotionally engaging adventure set in the Planescape D&D universe. My favorite game of all time.welcome to Sigil the city of doors.... best city, best story, best mood, best game ever... true old school rpg with choices that actually matters. just give it a chance you will not regret it..In playing Planescape: Torment, it becomes clear that the game is a construct of the ideals and carefully considered philosophies of passionate, hard-working minds. One gets the impression that \"Torment\" is a product of some irretrievable, perfect circumstance whereby a team of like-minded individuals were free to think and work outside of monetary and publisher constraints. Everything about the game seems thoughtful and inherently intelligent as well as being masterfully crafted. The stellar, original art and sound direction compliment it\\'s well-written, intricate plot. It is a detailed and subtle world inhabited by believably complex and meaningful characters with their own back stories and motivations. Instead of feeling that I was the center of the world, it seemed like it was all happening around me. I felt that I was killing real people for real reasons. Torment, like other brilliantly designed titles (i.e. Deus Ex, Fallout 2, Baldur\\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn) forced me to empathize and think. Such things define \\'art\\'. You\\'ll really need to just play it to see what is meant.Replayability is the major issue for me with games. Unfortunately this game does not have a great deal of it and I can\\'t give it a 10, but it\\'s still a very close run thing. Astounding. Unforgettable. Hypnotic. Exhilarating. The amnesiac storyline sounds cliched but this amnesiac storyline is so different, so well told, so deeply described that the game is more than forgiven for it. There are not many joinable NPCs, one of them is hard to find and another does not appear until near the end. But these NPCs have, individually, more personality than shelfloads of games than I could mention, so again, the game is more than forgiven. There are more than a few bugs. But this game is so engrossing that you don\\'t really care. Game absolved again. From the constant thud thud in the Lower Ward to the very inspiring fighting music in Curst, the sounds in this game make it unforgettably atmospheric. This game does not have many areas, does not last very long and has been accused of having an unsatisfactory ending. But no other game has such a plethora of memorable characters, stimulating dialogues, great music, spell visuals and moments of great hilarity in such a short space of time. It just shows what can happen when people\\'s motivation is belief and pride in what they are doing and a love for it too, as opposed to purely making money. As far as I know, there are two valid endings which occur about half way towards  the accepted ending (and one other  a lot closer). I can think of no other game which dares to do that. An exceptionally enduring masterpiece.I\\'m a huge fan of other Infinity engine games, Baldur\\'s gate, icewind dale. I never had the chance to play Planescape: Torment till very recently, and let me tell you, this game is awesome, very awesome. It\\'s not a game that would appeal to everyone, it\\'s more or less the anti-Diablo game. One that focuses less on the combat, not saying the combat is bad, but Torment is a lot less combat intensive than the other Infinity engine games. That being said, the focus is on the story, and my oh my, what a story they have crafted, and weaved. This story in this game is emotionally engaging for the player. The game does have a plethora of text however, a necessity, but nevertheless, a warning for the illiterate. If you are a gamer out there that like RPGs, and not afraid of reading, and just happen to find it somewhere, buy it, play it... I can\\'t possibly see how you would regret it. It seems to have stood the test of time very well.The best RPG ever, no question its all about the story - totally unconventional - avoids all the usual trite cliches of fantasy RPGs you\\'ll never play a game like it, despite searching high and low when you\\'ve finished it.This game has the most intense atmosphere a game can bring you. The storyline is enthralling, the soundtrack amazing. Most of all, the dialogue options in the game (yes you will read a lot)are fantastic. This game does not grow old.This game is a piece of art. I\\'ve never played in anything with similar depth in my life, and I\\'ve been playing games since 1992. Anyone looking for a remarkable experience should play it.fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic story fantastic storyI\\'ll make this a very short review just so I can avoid going in depth with the story and gameplay so new players will be surprised when they discover such things on their own. This is merely an encouragement to those unsure of this game\\'s high appraisal.\\n\\nYes, this game is every ounce as good as people say. It\\'s well written, well executed, and also manages to be enthralling and fun all at the same time. It\\'s debatable whether this is the best role playing game in the medium, but I find on par with the likes of Baldur\\'s Gate II.\\n\\nSo, if you have never played Planescape: Torment, do so. I promise you will feel like it was worth it once you start playing.I\\'ve gotten everyone I can to play this game by describing it to them as \"The best game you\\'ll ever read or the best book you\\'ll ever play.\"  Almost two decades later and so far every single one that gave it a try has agreed.  I remain confident that fact will never change as long as I live.This is true cRPG. In my books, the best one of perhaps 10 games that deserve the name. Oh, and if you would like to play it on modern machine, do yourself a favor and follow a modding guide on GOG.It is my dream to forget everything about this game and play it once again. The best story ever in games. I wish another game like this would be born one day.any review below 7, is a sign of skyrim players trying to play a real rpg\\nbest story of a video game\\nyou read more than a book\\ncombat is not good, except if you are using a mageIf you haven\\'t played Planescape: Torment yet, I envy you. It\\'s Alice in Wonderland of video games - a stunning work of art, a journey you\\'ll never forget, and a timeless classic that every intellectual gamer must be familiar with.While the graphics are now dated, this game still stands out as one of the best RPGs I\\'ve played as it\\'s story is the most compelling you\\'re likely to find.A videogame milestone, this Baldur\\'s Gate derivative (it uses the same engine) isn\\'t far from an interactive novel.  Cast as the Nameless One, an immortal being, you go in search of your own memories and the meaning of your life (and more...  but that would be a spoiler).  The story is vast and original, the art style marvellously gothic, and many characters in subsequent games are inspired by NPCs appearing in this one.  Still, I feel the game is overrated.  The story errs on the depressing side of tragic; it\\'s hard to feel a connection with the Nameless One, especially on the matter of his past romance.  Game mechanics wise, it\\'s busted; you\\'ll want to powergame the Int/Wis/Cha stats to get extra conversation options (the meat of the game), but the later stages are full of annoyingly tough enemies for no good reason.  It\\'s clear little effort got put into making the D&D 2E system work well: combat in this game is something to skip past (you can) rather than enjoy.  I wonder if there\\'s a fan patch to remove it?The best, deepest, most developed CRPG ever... We all should bow to it.Probably the wisest and most insightful of computer games ever. Comparable to Grim Fandango an Fallout series.A great role-playing game for people who would rather talk their way through fights while being engaged in an awesome story. PS:T is essentially a murder mystery with RPG elements, making it thoroughly enjoyable to play the first time through but limiting its replayability somewhat (which is why it gets a 9). If you like RPGs, and haven\\'t picked up this game, you should.This game is seriously awesome. It has probably the best story i\\'ve ever seen in a game, which is partly due to the fact that the hero isnt your typical make the sun shine and everyone hold hands and sing at the end type of guy. If you\\'re looking for an rpg with some originality, great humor, and one hell of a story, pick this up.Black Isle excel in creating gaming excellence in their genre of fantasy RPGs, and \"Planescape\" is a clear example of their efforts, firmly established as one of the best RPGs ever made. This game has it all: a deep, involving and at times graphic storyline that would Stephen King quit writing, healthy doses of bizarre humour and most of all, IMAGINATION. The world in which you exist is wonderfully tailored to capture the feel of a fantasy dimension, from the variety of species to the weird and wonderful locales. Indeed, the first 2 members of your party comprise of an undead immortal who can regenerate over time and a wise-cracking talking skull! There\\'s also so much to do, as within the game are practically hundreds of quests to complete. You can even join a faction to access other areas, and the theme of character development plays hugely. Plainly, if your into D+D, this is a must have, especially at the ludicrously cheap budget price it\\'s going at nowadays.This is not the best RPG game I have ever played. This is the best game I have ever played. This is so powerful, it will stay with you long after you have finished the game, like a great book or movie would. Right now I am trying to find a game that could bring me at least half the joy I had from expiriencing Planescape Torment. But...no. they just don\\'t make em like that anymore. Well Fallout 2 (or maybe Legacy of Kain Blood Omen, another great oldie) could be compared to Torment but the latter is somehow more gripping, believe me. So to the abyss with all the Final Fantasies, if you want some real stuff, which is beautiful, brutal and original, play Torment. By the way do not expect too much classic fantasy AD&D from the game, though it is of course based on that.On the most epic scale, Planescape: Torment rates among the gods - possibly the most brilliant, masterful, drawing, and overall superbly enjoyable game ever conceived. Amazing character interaction, superb customization, a beautifully intelligent plot, and so, so, so much more await you in Torment - one of those rare games that will probably *rise* in value as time proceeds.A masterwork, the only downside being nothing else will ever be this good! Oh, petty games makers kneel at the feet of this giant, and weep into your cups for your lofty ambitions will never rise to the level of this masterpiece. Simply astonishing piece of art, and almost an insult to call it a game.I have been a PC gamer close to 20 years and I own more than 200 original titles. I can say that this is one of the BEST games I EVER had the pleasure of playing and also own...the story is so deep and so are the characters.If you love RPG games you MUST buy it, if you hate RPG games go buy it and you\\'ll fall in love with them!Purely a work of art!!!It\\'s now 2003 and I sitll haven\\'t played a better computer RPG, and believe me, I\\'ve been looking. If you like RPGs, stop reading this review now and go find yourself a copy as soon as possible. Whjy? The storyline and interactions with non-player characters have more depth than any other game. Many novels would do well to have as much depth and wel-done story.At last, an RPG in the full sense of the word. Planescape: Torment reaches new heights in storytelling, originality and gameplay. It is a refreshing change from the predictable Save-The-World Tolkienesque RPG\\'s, instead opting for a game built on self-discovery and self-awareness. Torment is so good, gratifying, saddening and emotionally charged that YOU also go through a journey of self discovery, not just your pixelated protagonist. One of the Greatest creations of all time-and you haven\\'t played an RPG until you\\'ve played Planescape: Torment.You may think my rating is excessive, but Torment is quite simply the best game ever to come to the PC. An unbelievably good story and background help make this game one of THE best things ever committed to the Computer and it certainly rules the D&D CRPG roost.Honestly, I have yet to find a game that does what Planescape Torment did better. And it\\'s been almost 20 years of searching. It will probably never happen,but if that day comes, it will be glorious.One of the best isometric RPGs out there. Unique story, characters and sub-plots, and plenty of stuff to explore, and NPCs to converse with, each with interesting stories of their own, which only adds to the twists and turns of the overall story. A must have, for any gamer that likes the Infinity Engine games.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely the best RPG game I\\'ve ever played. It is a true non-linear game that lets you do pretty much whatever you want. It is fully possible to smash orphans in the groin with a sledge hammer, if you are so inclined. The game suffers from a myriad of bugs in its original form, applying \"Killap\\'s Unofficial Fallout 2 Patch\" removes most of the bugs and adds a bit of extra content.Bought it in \\'99 and still playing it after 12 years...that\\'s all I have to say. The greatest RPG game of all time. Even with many bugs the game is almost perfect.I got caught messing with a farmers daughter, forced into marriage at gunpoint, got addicted to jet then pimped my wife while I went to run guns and star in porn.THAT my friends is a ROLE PLAYING GAMEPossibly not just the greatest RPG of all time but GAME of all time.Black Isle Studios, we miss you.This is a great game!  The best of the Fallout serie.   A true RPG.  Few games can be copared with this one.When I played I was a BLAST, it was the first one of the RPG games I\\'ve ever played, and as the people say you\\'ll always remember the first one. It is a highlight in the RPG business. Realistically I have no words to qualify this one if I could I\\'ll give it a 1000 or even a 1000000. Please have in mind that the interface is an old one nothing like the ones we are used now please be patient it will be worth it I promiseIncredible Game. Expands on the first game exponentially. It is many times larger, longer, and much more fun to play. While the first game was such a revolutionary concept for its time, Fallout 2 is simply a blast to play even today with its incredibly outdated (even for 1998) birds-eye view graphics. The only true fault is the near suffocating amount of inane pop culture references that are thrown in at every opportunity, which can at times detract from the often dark and serious tone of the game. 9/10This game is legendary! They don\\'t make RPGs like that anymore! Gripping story, hundreds of hours of gameplay, a huge free word to explore, killable children (It might sound sick, but it is about the freedom the developers gave to the player. If you don\\'t want to hurt them... don\\'t do it, but  \\'Black Isle\\' won\\'t restrain you from doing it!). The game was a perfect blend of funny and adult content, with dozens of memorable dialogs. The way the turn based combat mechanics worked was great (a certain amount of action point could be used during combat to shoot, crouch, heal yourself, move etc.) The character stat system was also great. It was divided into four categories: attributes, skills, traits and perks. The player is governed by the system called \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L.\" (an acronym for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck). There are also 18 different skills in the game. Perks are a special element of the level up system. Every three levels (or every four if the player chooses a certain trait), the player is presented with a list of perks and can choose one to improve their character. All these had great impact on gameplay (smart character had more dialog option etc,). The post-apocalyptic word of the game was rich and  the story is very memorable. Arroyo is suffering from a drought. The village elder tasked the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller (Main protagonist of Fallout 1) referred to as the Chosen One to perform the quest of retrieving a Garden of Eden Creation Kit for the village. The player is given nothing more than the Vault Dweller\\'s jumpsuit, a RobCo PIPBoy 2000 handheld device, a Vault 13 water flask, a spear and some cash to start on his quest. During his quest the Vault Dweller will face foes like the Enclave, mutants, raiders and many more. I enjoyed the visual direction of the game very much. The music was also very memorable!\\nI can only recommend this game!A great game that got me into CRPGs, it has everything that was missing in fallout 1. Memorable characters, more customization, another great story, epic ending, no time limit ... WAR ... WAR NEVER CHANGESIf you\\'re looking for a good introduction to computer RPGs of the past and don\\'t want to over complicate things, this is the perfect game for that. A lot of the mechanics are faulty, and a lot of things are completely useless and may deceive the newer player, but that\\'s to be expected in this game where moving alongside the coast will most likely get you killed for reasons you won\\'t understand until much later. Spend some time with this one, even if it seems daunting at first.It\\'s quite a departure from the content scaling of Fallout 3 and followers, and oh so refreshing.Surely the best RPG I ever played, with Fallout 1 and well, Baldur\\'s Gate 2, coming very close.\\nJust look for the \"The Ultimate guide to Fallout 2\" on the Internet and make sure you do every quest while reading the walkthrough. I hope Brian Fargo make something comparable in Wasteland 2, with the new graphics.I have been a fan of the Fallout series since I grabbed the first game way back when, the first one was great, but I\\'ve never been able to finish the second, I played through the story line at least twice and get stuck at the same spot every time. There are a lot of great improvements to the second from the first, but I don\\'t feel it completely lived up to Fallout 1I think I\\'ve played this game about 10 times, each time polishing character just to reveal as many quest as it was possible and each ime finding new. Addictive as jet. Surprising in so many ways (have you ever died traveling the wastelands after using too much jet? hey, steroids my save your life when taken at right time)! Once one of my friends finished the game fighting with bare hands only! It was amazing to see his character actually doing this. Ahhh, nobody rocks anymore like Valve Software.(Arcanum rocks as hell as well ;-)Fallout 2 should definitely get more points than 10 out of 10 :) I\\'ve lost track of how many times I have completed this game since 1999 and each time is was fun.As amazing as the original, some bits where a bit tough to work out and if you didn\\'t search every section of one area there is a good chance you\\'ll have to do a good bit of backtracking. Despite this it is an amazing game and deserves a play just for the storyline, only one bug which is the same as the fallout 1 which is the colours, same fix in the ddraw.ini file (google it) and I can\\'t mark it down for it as it is a problem with modern computers not the game.\\n\\nGive it a chance and if you get stuck there\\'s no shame looking at a guide, lots to do, large areas, plenty of gameplay, so many years on and still a great game.This game is really a masterpiece .Fallout 1 had maybe better story and atmosphere, but Fallout 2 got the better game play, more funny quotes of characters, more options, less linearity and much more. I really miss Black Isle studio.A truly amazing game. As long as you don\\'t mind having to read a lot, you will absolutely love this game. A definite contender for the best RPG of all time.I have purchased fallout 1 and 2 twice.  Once, back in 2000 but the game suffered from so many bugs that it was definitely difficult if not impossible to finish the game.  It definately wasn\\'t possible to finish every quest.  Even the final encounters were buggy and potentially game breaking.  The answer? Save more... I had forgotten how many hundreds of hours I poured over Fallout 1 and 2 back in 2000. Buying the collection on steam for 8 bucks(original cds long lost) has definately reminded me how genius the storyline and gameplay are.  Everything is much deeper than you initially believe. You definitely have to install \"Killap\\'s Unofficial Fallout 2 Patch.\" It fixes 99% of the nonsense. You will need the high-res patch as well. Even with the high res patch the graphics will be the worst part of the experience.  Time has not been kind.  I have so much fun playing that I can look past that weakness.  Be warned though the Steam version is definately the one containing the last patches released by interplay 10 years ago or whenever. This version on steam is minus 1000\\'s of bug fixes by fans.  You MUST install the fan patches to have the games run properly.  Out of the download box the game was 400x800 and displaying a rainbow all over the screen.  Still a 10.This game is a true example of how good classic games can be. The graphics are excellent even for an old game, it doesn\\'t match up to newer games but it also doesn\\'t hurt your eyes like the textures of many older games do. The story is great and it uses cut-scenes to give a realistic sense of urgency to the players main quest. I have NEVER run into any bug surprisingly, I don\\'t know what people saying this to have tons of glitches is about. The gameplay is great as well, absolutely flawless. You get absolute freedom, you can even kill children in this game if you like.This is very likely the best RPG of all time. Certainly its age shows somewhat, but not nearly as much as most games even 5 years old. This game must have simply had a magical assortment of a development team because WOW it shows. Even creating a character is better than most RPGs today due to the SPECIAL stat system with perks and skills which is the best RPG stat system I have seen to date. The characters you can recruit are varied and interesting, and build their character through in depth dialogue as much as through combat and (in some cases) reactions to your choices. The factions of the game feel like they are more from the real world than most games, few characters, even the NPCs are complete caricatures. The exploration is just the right blend of time spent exploring and traveling. SOME backtracking makes the world feel a lot more interconnected than simply walking from one town to the next like a Final Fantasy game. Very open style where you can skip towns, visit out of order(to some extent, as the game does not change due to your level, but there is some leeway), or even ignore the main story if you want. Hundreds of fun small moments, great uses of skills(though the overall balance is certainly leaning towards certain skills- no game is perfect.) Humor is nice but the idea of being able to skip it in New Vegas was certainly the way to go - One of the only serious flaws in Fallout 2 is the fight between being a serious game and being a humorous one. You can have humor in a serious game but sometimes this one can go over the top. One of the greatest games of all time but probably not for someone that really loves RPGs at this point as the ISO view and old UI do make it a bit of a chore to get through. If you can get through that though you will have an incredible time playing this game.Personally, I think Fallout 2 is the best in the series. Yeah, I know the graphics are 1999 and it plays in 2D but geez, this really is how a RPG should be. Once you get past the dated graphics you\\'ll be gripped by the storyline and great dialogue. The dark humor of the Fallout series is at it\\'s best here.Probably the main quest is better in the first (not for the quest per-se, but what the quest-story is about, FEV, Mutants and so on), but overall the sequel is kick-ass, it has so many quests... i just reinstalled it and can\\'t stop playing :)One of the best RPG\\'s! It is almost as good as Arcanum.We could end up just like that and we gotta watch our backs, a damn fine game to me, enough to keep me sitting at the keyboard for a long time roaming through the wastelands.Not as good as first Fallout, world is much less realistic (eg. you start on place where it\\'s hard to meet something that will harm you badly, but you can go only in limited directions if you don\\'t want to be shred to pieces), but with good atmosphere, great plots, many quests and informations, many easter-eggs, many.... FO2 is just huge, but there are better games.Far ahead of its time non-linear RPG. Comparable to the Ultima series & Deus Ex in terms of influence and advances in virtual world building. This game is not very politically correct, it\\'s only concerned with being a masterpiece.Played this for the first time in 2014 and enjoyed it tremendously. It\\'s bigger and more over the top than it\\'s original brother. There\\'s a lot of pop culture references and tongue in cheek jokes, which make the game a lot of fun. It also has more weapons, items and perks than the first one. The amount of quests is incredible and you get a different ending  for each city depending on your choices.\\n\\nHowever the plot is slightly less focused and the story is less convincing than those of it\\'s predecessor. Which is why i prefer the original fallout. I\\'d rate this one a 9.2/10 compared to a 9.8/10 for fallout.Fallout is the best!The game that change my perception of role playing game.I didn\\'t know game can be so alive before I played this game.One of the best! ...That\\'s it ....! :) A little buggy ... But who cares?Superb game..had it so many years and I still reinstall it and play like MAD!The only RPG I\\'ve ever enjoyed playing and probably the best game I\\'ve ever played overall.Best game eveR! i love the lighting effects on night levels!!!1 everything lights up so franticly..... gore effects superb! this game is so expandable... it makes my head spin 360!After completing first Fallout i waited and i waited and i waited. And finally, when the sequel hit the shelves, i hit the stores, and got my hands on a copy from a third try! :) was the wait worth it! :)\\nEven though not much changed, the innovative additions and new storyline were welcome!\\nExcellent Game!\\nFallout RuleZ, son! :DWhile not quite as amazing as the original (which is just like saying x mountain isn\\'t as tall as Everest) this is still one of the legendary RPGs of all time. If you have even a slight interest in top down RPGs, you need to get this.Best of the Interplay FO series and stands head and shoulders with the Bethesda games FO2 expands on the first game by leaps and bounds with a great immersive story loads of character customization choice, flexibility, challenging, rewarding, no timer, mods FO2 is still one of the best RPG\\'s out there.Fallout 2 is simply a great game. There\\'s lots to do and the environment is great, especially when you mod the game with sFall and killap\\'s unofficial patch that fixes a lot of the bugs that were in the original game. I also like the fact that it\\'s a game where everything doesn\\'t always go your way (even though a lot does go your way :) ). There\\'s also lots of comical dialogue, events and random encounters.\\n\\nNow, even for some of the game\\'s faults, it\\'s still a great game. The faults of the game include silly moments, quests that end abruptly and well, bugs. However, like I said a lot of this can be fixed with Killap\\'s patch.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to complain about graphics, it\\'s an old game, doing so would be very silly and stupid. In fact, in my opinion the graphics are charming. Sprites are a little low res and textures too, however, compared to other 2D games it\\'s still great! The textures and such can be improved with sFall and the high res pack, if you want to use nicer graphics.\\n\\nEdit: Look at some of the negative reviews. Bashing this game for the single reason that they enjoy Wasteland 2 and they have heard people saying Fallout 2 is better one too many times. Now I won\\'t name any names, but yeah... Then they went here and saw it had a better score, thus they just had to put in a \"revenge review\" and put 0/0. Even though the two games are really similar except for the story and setting (which is still very similar) . Quite silly, but I suppose you\\'re not allowed to think FO2 is better. Their main argument therefor always falls to complaining about the graphics.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, Wasteland 2 is great too, both games are, and there\\'s nothing wrong from enjoying both of the games.My personal all-time favorite CRPG. I\\'ve been playing since it came out in 1998. The things I love are: great post-apocalyptic atmosphere, awesome turn-based combat, non-linear playthrough and a variety of gamestyles/ways to solve quests/ways to win battles etc, variety of items/guns/ammo/armor, numerous sidequests, memorable NPCs...you name it! I\\'m hoping for a revival for this kind of games to come!The Greatness of this game is not nostalgia or wishful thinking. The greatness of this game is in the writing. In the mad excessive glory of the plot lines and the openess of the role playing to do what you want and play it anyway you could dare to imagine. There will come a day when developers gain the ambition to try and rebuild this with contemporary graphics or even make something better. I hope they try, because if someone could do something like this in 2012 it would rock the gaming world with greatnessThis is a true classic, if you want a deep and compelling RPG than this game is for you(if you dont mind the age of the game).Personally I think this game never gets old it is one of my favorite RPGs of all time and I have played it for years and years and it never gets old. It\\'s a shame that Fallout 3 was such a big disappointment.This is objectively the best rpg ever made. A truly open ended experience featuring memorable characters and a large variety of quests with multiple answers to completing them. The only people who wouldn\\'t prefer this to any modern fallout game are those with poor taste or no imagination.How can anyone give a 9 to this game?I guess they didnt try to play it with an unarmed specialist like I do.The game is perfect.One of the best games for the PC that will never lose its value.The  Original great Tactical RPG Experience Masterpiece that is Fallout 2.\\nThis was my first Fallout I\\'ve played back in the days.\\nThe character building and how you wish to play it. Sneaky or guns blazing? High charisma and a speach only build. You could beat the game as you wanted. A true wasteland Fallout experience. The different speech options depending on your perks int and charisma.  Yes the gripe was that not a lot has changed from Fallout 1 and not much has improved in the engine but for me this was not a big problem.\\nGreat story and soundtrack make you really immerse in the game. Spend countless hours exploring and questing. Finding interesting new easter eggs and fun facts.\\nA lot of equipment, weapons and even a car to travel the wastelands. Some future looking equipment and old guns. Interesting locations with the limitations of that year the game has a lot of variance.\\nA game that I come back from time to time just to have some fun.\\nGreat experience and a classic RPG. 9 out of 10.OH MY GOD. How can anyone dislike this game? If your PC bugs out then get rid of your friggin viruses. No replay value? If you don\\'t change the way you play it, then I guess it could seem so.\\nThis is a top cult classic game, which rocks the socks out of any other game ever made. PERIOD.\\nI\\'d bet the reason \"new kids\" won\\'t appreciate it is because they have no patience these days.Game for the ages, the best creation in the gaming industry.Huge variability, interesting stories, amazing world and a giant study of the gaming universeThis is one of those games that will please everyone. And what beautiful music here! Depressive motives they drive into depression and create an incredible atmosphere. 10 out of 10, the best game.One of the best single player post nuclear games I\\'ve ever played.  Not even Fallout 3 has managed to touch this game in terms of plot/writing/choices.I really, REALLY can\\'t help but laugh at some of the comments below. Yes, you do have to clear out enemy checkpoints (guard posts) every time you go through them. What so many of them fail to grasp is that YOU DON\\'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEM. Maybe someone used to Halo or even Call of Duty expects to perform the same action over and over again, but this game is NOT Halo or Call of Duty. For my playthrough, I adopted a full stealth strategy. Silenced Pistol, sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher if I needed a lot of bang. When I first started, though, I was popping caps left and right with a shotgun and flamethrower. But the thing about this game is that you\\'re NOT relegated to any one experience. As I said, I adopted a stealth strategy. How do I deal with checkpoints? Either sneak around them in the brush, or shoot a guard from a distance, wait for all his buddies to come looking for me, then sneak through while they\\'re busy searching. And the game ENCOURAGES this. Or, if I\\'m not in the mood for sneaking, I can borrow a boat from the Dock at the bar and take the river route. Very few guard posts and they\\'re less likely to chase you. So if you think you\\'re having a hard time, CHANGE your strategy. You\\'re not limited by the game, you\\'re limited by yourself. As for the game itself, its quite beautiful, at least before you start blowing it up. The fire effects are pretty awesome but still have a ways to go. Best I\\'ve ever seen, though. You can actually predict where the flame will go based on wind direction and terrain. What else can I say? The world is very immersive. AI is frustrating, but in a good way. Often I\\'ll think I was perfectly hidden when someone will spot me becuase I poke a gun barrel around a corner. Often I\\'ll kill a guard, think i\\'m in the clear then find out he had a buddy just down the road who saw me kill him. And sometimes that buddy will shoot off a flare and call MORE of his buddies to finish me off. All in all, this game punishes your mistakes to be sure, but definitely rewards good performance. So if you play this game, don\\'t think that you\\'re limited to roads or checkpoints. Don\\'t think you have to kill every enemy or do every mission. Make the game yours. Kill some buffalo or zebras. And most of all DON\\'T get discouraged, where theres a will (and a lot of ammo) theres a way.Best game I\\'ve ever played in my life. And the only RPG I\\'ve played all the way through more than once.I\\'ve played more RPG\\'s than most people will ever even read about and I can honestly say, Fallout was the pinnacle of roleplaying for its time, in many ways its still not been surpassed. Judging it by the standards of its time, it blew everything else away. The story is different and setting almost a unique amongst rpgFantastic, non-dumbed-down, RPG that genuinely lets you play like YOU...BUT...bugged to hell. Be prepared for your PC to die, and die often. Save, save, save, and wait for the first time you dance round yir room screaming abuse at a screen that\\'s locked up because you have too many items in your (SPOILER!)...still, though, the best RPG I\\'ve ever played. \"Hey, causing that much destruction wasn\\'t easy...\".Great game. Better than Fallout 3 in almost every way, except of course the graphics.I have to give this game a \\'nine\\' plus rating because it is not for everyone. It is still a classic game as is the first Fallout. Imagine the Bioware D&D series of the Forgotton Realms that you have played turned into a apocolyptic, road warrior type, rpg. I have loved this series for many years. But if you are expecting a first person shooter you should be informed that it is a strategy game. Mega mohawks, shootguns, ak47s, techno punk with leather armor all on a game board to move and beat the computerized components hex/octo movement engine. Best unique non-traditional rpg ever made.A great game, but with some minor flaws. The music, atmosphere, and graphics are all excellent, as are the story and characters. However, the game seems unfinished; it\\'s buggy; and (I think) it\\'s a bit too difficult.One of the greatest triumphs of gaming. Artfully constructed game world, atmospheric setting, interesting characters, interesting narrative - well written. All of it unique. Strategic combat, non-linear, freedom, choice and consequence, moral ambiguity. A triumph in thoughtful design. 10 years later and the industry has offered little else that even comes close - and certainly not in the last 5 years.Brilliant classics for post apo fans !\\nI played it a lot in the past and now it is the right moment to come back to the roots.\\nThe game has a good design on its own.This game just improves on everything the first game did, and made it better. The graphics are sharper, the locations are grander the quests are more epic. So what\\'s wrong with it? For all it does right it also doesn\\'t introduce too much new to the gameplay. In essence it looks and feels exactly like the first game, just allot sexier. A shame that they didn\\'t take a few more risks. But none the less, it still is a fantastic game and a worthy successor to the original.after 15 years still the best game i\\'ve ever played with it\\'s atmosphere, skills, perks, turn-based system, possible endings, characters, details and background -2014-Fallout 2 is simply without a doubt, one of the most underated rpg games in history! It is similar to the first Fallout in which i will say, if it aint broken, dont fix it! This game will be another one of the classic gems that will forever be rememberd and respected by me!one of the thing that i probably will never understand, it\\'s how fallout 2 is still so obscure to the big public.\\nafter the release of fallout 3, i thought that f1 and f2 would have seen their importance recognized, but they are still semi unknown. this makes me sad :(\\nanyway... if you never played fallout 2, grab it now and thanks me later.Fallout 2 is the definition of a sequel that actually succeeds in going bigger and better than the first. Though, I lightly say it. As everything in this is amped up to it\\'s full potential and doesn\\'t disappoint, there are two major glaring issues that just make the first Fallout a better game.\\n\\nIt\\'s thoroughly addicting, more so than the first Fallout, as it tightens up certain gameplay elements are smoothed up and some major improvements are put in (companion controls!).  The scale of the map is massive, and feels like the largest Fallout to date. The amount of things to do will keep glued to this game for at least 50 hours.\\n\\nWriting is also substantial, featuring more NPC interactions, large choices on what dialogue to choose is awesome.\\n\\nBut, the too biggest issues are the story and the pop culture references. The story is essentially a re-hash of the first Fallout. Replacing the water chip with the GECK, and mutants with the Enclave. It\\'s more forgivable because the amount of things Fallout 2 offers and is essentially an excuse to go out exploring. The second would be the pop culture references. In Fallout 1, the pop culture references were fun and memorable because they were balanced out and didn\\'t try too hard. Fallout 2 has an excessive amount of pop culture references and it looses it\\'s charm and kind of kills the atmosphere.\\n\\nStill, Fallout 2 is an addicting and fun game. Worth a playthrough or two.After the perfect Fallout 1 and great opinions about the 2nd part, I was really looking forward for the 2nd part. The game mechanics are great as in the first part, especially the freedom of creating your character. Unfortunately the game is unbalanced like F1, many skills and perks are very weak in comparison to others. The companions are more important than it was in F1, unfortunately there are not many orders you can give to them. The combat system is great, it makes you think and not forcing you to play a reaction game. The setting is perfect like always and it was interesting to see the developpment of some cities and west California.\\nBut in comparison to Fallout 1 the second part is much worse in my opinion. First of all, there are so few new graphics and new sounds. This game looks more like an addon, where you use much of the data from the main game. Somehow I needed to motivate myself to play further especially in the middle part, the atmosphere in F1 was much better. I dont know why, but I could not get into the world so well like in F1. Another thing is, that there are so many bugs, it is unexcusable.\\nOverall good game, but the 1st Fallout was much better.Story wise, this is the best fallout game ever. The gameplay holds up ptetty well, and the violence is way overthe top in a good way. There are numourous pop cultar references. Less serious than the first fallout at times, and way darker at others. If gpu like games with a good story, this is for you.I will start with saying that this game is far better then Fallout 3 (ps3), Fallout 4 (pc) and i probably enjoyed it more then new Vegas (ps3) too and tactics ( only played 2 hrs).\\n\\nOnto the review.\\nGameplay: This game is a turn based rpg , set in a post apoclyptic world. You have huge map to explorer and you can if you want to go straight to the last locations. The game has tons of various cool character you can talk to. And quests you can do. With multiple factions all with they own agendas, and if you don`t like any of them you can either kill them or skip doing those quests all together. Also every companion can be order to be offensive, use melee weapons or ranged, carry stuff or to wait or move if they stand in you way , witch may happens sometimes. It might no be the best gameplay but it still works just fine. And the game is neither to hard nor to unforgiving.\\n\\nCharacter development / leveling/skills and quest: How your develop you character is entirely up to you. Do you want to fist you way trough the game you can do that. Do you wanna be a sniper and let your companions if you want to have companions do the fight for you , you can do just that. Do you want to play the game alone you can do that. For every four level you reach you can choose a skill and some of this skills is pretty good and actually has a meaning. Do you want to be a sweet talker and try to talk your way trough most of the quests you can do that. Compared to the later fallout especially fallout 4 at least in a large extent you have more freedom in how you do your quests and how you accomplish them all with multiple solutions and your choices also has consequences. All the character you meet have their own personalities and perhaps even problems or a reason they need your help or a reason why the want to join you and lastly those character especially on the companion side is plentiful and enough of them but not to many and neither to few. All skills have they own usefulness. Almost every character you meet has something to tell about the world. Plus if you really want to you can be a made - man/woman. And lastly you earn exp by doing quests and killing or even picking up a special items or using seeing special encounters. So yeah the game is pretty violent. Like shooting the groin of someone or the head of someone.\\n\\nFactions: A short note on factions. Every factions as previously said have they own agendas. Some are evil som are good some are somewhere in between. Some want to make prostitution and gambling legal. Some want to focus on something else.\\n\\nSetting: Perhaps most important of all is the setting. The setting is great. It feels very mush like an a post-apocalyptic game. All of the locations feel different in a good way. Different cultures. Different rules in the different places. Every places has it own mini-stories of side quests to tell. And with the wonderful music it could nt be any/much better. And the game has tons of Charm and Humor.\\n\\nMusic: the soundtrack is very good. And a lot of the tracks if not all you will remember.It really helps you immerse yourself into the setting\\n\\nBonus: I would put it here. The humor is very good. There is a lot of times you will laugh. Like missing a 95% hit or hitting a target with 20% hit for that matter. You will laugh by the funny and witty and good written dialogue. A lot of cool Easter eggs that even i understood or laughed and thought was funny, i am not the best at finding Easter eggs, but i could in this game.\\nAnd the ending is more then good enough to and so is the voice acting at least for that time. And despite some few crashes the game is still utterly fantascic. Give it a shot , even if you disliked fallout 3/4. Hugely different.\\n\\nScore : highly recommended 10/10 if you enjoy turn based rpg set in a wonderful and brilliant rpg setting\\nOne of the best pc game i have ever played if not the best . The only one that is close in Planescape, Deus ex and perhaps Max payne 2 and Portal 2.\\n\\nAnd just if you wonder i would rate new Vegas 9.5\\nfallout 3 9/10\\nfallout 4 6-7/10\\n\\nNBI am going to say this is beyond me why this game ha snt gotten enough recognition, well atleast that what it seems like. How a game like this can`t get on top 128 games on gamefaq when games like fallout 3 or say undertale ( as there is many who thought it should nt be there)or any top 50 pc games is beyond me. But i guess everyone has is taste, no bias. and yeah i know in the fallout community this is considered the best fallout game and i have to agree despite putting at least 250 hrs in fallout 3 and 250 hrs in new vegas if not more. Thx for reading.This is the BEST Rpg ever made! A real rpg thats not only shooting killing; but also based on intelligence, changing dialogue options. Make fun of politics, social events (for example you will see Mike Tyson in game:) words are not enough just play it. Also fallout 3 is not like f2, not like we expectedWhat can you say about a legendary game Such as Fallout 2? This game is arguably the one that really put the Fallout franchise on the map. You play the grandchild of the Vault Dweller, who grew up in a small tribe isolated from the rest of the world. As the Vault Dweller\\'s grandchild you are naturally the Chosen One in the village. A drought has plagued the village, the cattle are dying, crops withering, and children are sickly. The only ray of hope is the legend of the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, or G.E.C.K. which has the power to save the village. But saving your village will be more complicated than just retrieving this artifact, of that you can be sure.\\n\\nThe good: While the gameplay is nearly identical to it\\'s predecessor much of the gameplay has been improved. You can now loot multiple corpses if they fall on the same hexagon which is a massive improvement. The item transfer box is now capped at 99,999 and the counter moves much faster for precision item transfers, like money. The music is still great and lends to the atmosphere of a wasteland, top talent like Ron Perlman who returns to as the voice of the Narrator, and Michael Dorn who voices the super mutant sheriff of Broken Hills, named Marcus. There are also more than double the items, more weapons, armor, and tools are at your disposal in your quest to save Arroyo, your village. With more companions, more humor, more everything. Also the option of a car that makes travelling across world map much faster, and gives you a mobile storage container for those goodies you might need, but can\\'t carry. The down side of course is that the car eats up energy from Microfusion Cells and Small Energy Cells like crazy, both of which are the ammunition for your energy weapons. Which means that at some points you can get stuck deciding on weather to fuel the car, or have use of your exotic guns.\\n\\nThe bad: Too many pop culture references, there are far more then necessary. The lucky part is that if you don\\'t get the joke it generally doesn\\'t get in the way. Due to being top down isometric it suffers some of the same flaws as it\\'s predecessor. If enemies are close to the edge of an area they can die in places you can\\'t loot them in, and sometimes they end up in places you can\\'t shoot at them in. Luckily your companions can shoot enemies outside the screen area.\\n\\nFinal thought: An overall improvement on the original game, with a more user friendly interface. The game is overall double the size of the original with twice, or more the weapons, armor, locations, characters, side quests, and companions. A must have for RPG fans.Why more companies didn\\'t learn from this classic I will never know. Fallout 2 defines RPG. I still play this game currently and find it just as rewarding as when it was released.Go wherever you want, do what you want, if you want, but if you want a water chip, take it to the village, on all sides the extremely strong RPG.The legend continues. Excellent continuation of one of the best games of all time with twice as much content. Double the gameplay time, double the character level, very good writing, all the shortcomings of the first Fallout fixed (quest logs, companions control..) and on top of that add a new shiny post-apo car for your desert travelling. Hmmm. On the other hand, the overall experience isn\\'t as masterfully compact as it is in the original Fallout and it\\'s basically the same thing all over again, samey visuals, music, experience etc. But when you got your favourite, the most delicious food in the world, can you complain when you get it again and in double the portion? I certainly can\\'t, both Fallout 1 and 2 are classics of the genre and must plays for all cRPG\\'s or post-apocalyptic lovers. 9/10The best game of all times and peoples along with Baldur`s Gate 2.\\nQuests are generally the best that has ever had no analogues in other games.Compared to them, even the quests of the witcher 3 look wretched.Personally I see this as a pinnacle of games production. I was challenging, interesting and kept me engrossed for hours at a time.\\n\\nGreat improvement over the original, the controls are more forgiving and the interface although only marginally improved seemed freindlier to use.\\n\\nThe game offers great characters and varied experiences with a fulfilling player experience. Although I first played this game over a decade ago, I\\'ve since bought 3 copies just because of disk failures / system upgrades, and each time I\\'ve bought it I\\'ve played it longing for more!\\n\\nI cannot think of any single game that has captivated me for more than a decade other than this one.This game was I why I fell in love with PC gaming and RPGs. There was no better post-apocalyptic RPG since then. What Bethesda did with this franchise is just travesty. I own it in old school cd-rom (boxed version, steam (before GOG existed), and GOG.The only thing that annoy me in this game, is the tons of bugs in the first versions.\\n\\nAhead of that detail, everything on this game ressamble the pure adventure in a true wasted land.\\n\\nA mix between the future of Terminator, with brutal tribal gangs like Mad Max, in all trash way of the best thriller in radioactivity land you can imagine.\\n\\nEvery time I play this game, something new uncover in the admist, and no matter the kind of character I play, fun never fail to amuse me.\\n\\nThe kind of dialogues and answers you can choose in this game is beyond pleasure.One of the best RPG\\'s that I\\'ve played and can always come back to. With amazing writing and dialogue, more challenging combat mechanics than it\\'s predecessor, and a thrilling adventure the whole way through, this game is a must buy.one of the very best rpgs of all time. if you haven\\'t played it, do yourself a favor and buy it. it doesn\\'t matter how old it is. its one of THOSE games.Fallout 2 is a higher sort RPG.\\n\\nYou have to be patient (because from the subway not to a big guy from a shotgun) and persistent (some moments may bake), but this is a charm of this game ..\\n\\nIn my opinion, it is worth playing it, it is worth spending 9.99 euros because the game will last for a lot of hours and is one of the best games of real-time strategy combined with the elements of role-playing games .. I often played this game when I was small ..\\n\\nSo I wish you good luck and remember: \"War, War Never Changes ....\"i would give this a 8.5 i find that i get killed allout but gets made up by the ability to save anny time and absoulte freedom for the charatorMuch easier and more accessible than it\\'s predecessor. With the learning curve being not quite so steep here and the game not regularly killing you at the drop of a hat, the game is much more playable than the first. There\\'s a lot more content, the story is better, and you have a lot more options as to how you choose to play the game. From a gameplay perspective this game blows the first Fallout away, but from a technical perspective the game is lacking.\\n\\nThere are still numerous bugs an glitches that plague the game. One such recurring glitch forced me to have to leave and restart the game periodically. It\\'s frustrating to no end, but these glitches do not ruin what is otherwise an excellent RPG experience that feels ahead of it\\'s time. The only other complaint I have is that occasionally it can be hard to figure out how to progress the main quest. This can lead to extended periods of just mindless wandering, or forced trips to online guides and walkthroughs. Overall that is a minor complaint and the only real issue I have with the game is the amount of glitches it has.\\n\\nSo this is one I can recommend. It\\'s got issues but I still had a lot of fun with it. I was incredibly impressed with how modern a lot of the features in this game feel. The interface obviously shows age, but the amount of player choice here is staggering at times. It\\'s a shame that the game has irritating technical issues, because otherwise it feels ahead of it\\'s time. Still this is one I recommend if you enjoy post apocalyptic games or just god RPGs. I give it a 7.5/10-Good.Fallout 2 is a perfect sequel, certainly loyal to what was the first Fallout. Of course: we must still remember that the first chapter is where it all started, but certainly in the second, is where everything has been continued in a great way.\\n\\nFallout 2\\'s plot maybe isn\\'t impactful as the first chapter, but it has certainly a very high quality. I liked the \"tribal\" style in which the game is started, with the Temple of Trials and the Arroyo village\\'s charm. The historical background is not complex as complex as that of the first chapter, but provides valuable revelations about previous events: the failure to deliver the water-chip to Vault 13 and the mistake of shipping with Vault-City (what an irony, thinking back to the first Fallout), but especially the abominable role of the Vaults and the social experiments program. In this context, the role of the Enclave is predominant and impressive: if in the first Fallout, the Master recognized the grandeur of evolution, here the Enclave despises it; denying the survival and the will to survive of the human race, by labeling the \"different\" or \"survivor\" as mutated or subhuman. They are what remains of the United States, and in this there is also a critical view to the country, which we know today, which isn\\'t a holy-country. Kill millions of people under the guise of purifying the human race, proclaiming itself as the \"world policeman\" as quoted in the game. Frank Horrigan himself, is a contradiction: a true mutant, who hates mutants. Enclave\\'s plans can be summed up in the saying \"the end justifies the means\". And in the end of all this arrogance, as a purifying poetry, the game ends with a huge atomic explosion, a symbol of the past, and the devastation of the atomic power unleashed by human hands, that once again triumphs on everything, and reigns supreme. A scene that puts chills, and a perfect ending.\\n\\nFallout 2\\'s gameplay is generally an improvement of that of the first chapter: commands to manage the companions are much more complex and more strategic, the number of weapons has been changed and increased, the level cap to 21 has been removed allowing the player to progress further and become stronger. The trading system remained perfect as it was, but now the traders have a respawn of goods, allowing the adventure to be much more accessible and dynamic, creating a real economy between the character and the game world. The system in which the skills affect the character is always perfect, and based on rigid mathematical calculations. The map has been expanded (about 2 times bigger, I heard) and also the number of visitable locations has increased obviously; among these you can also revisit the Vault 13, Vault 15, the base of Mariposa and Shady Sands, who were present in the first Fallout. For the main quest there is no time limit, unlike the first chapter, and this to me personally liked because you can complete many beautiful side quests without hurry. Even the achievement of individual objectives in the main quest is easier and more intuitively. However the game is not any easier: in fact the problems begin already in the Temple of Trials and the random fights in the game map are simply absurd; you can meet group of 6 or even 8 enemies that attack you, one after the other, and you can\\'t even heal the wounds that you\\'re already dead. I noticed that even some enemies can move 2 times per turn. This doesn\\'t make the game fun, but only frustrating. On the opposite I rather liked the fight against the final boss, Frank Horrigan, that it has been difficult but balanced and fulfilling.\\n\\nThe graphics are identical to that of the first Fallout, there is always the charm of the isometric view, and the artistic retro-futuristic and steampunk beauty that makes Fallout 2, a true Fallout game. The soundtrack is excellent, legacy of the soundtrack of the first chapter.\\n\\nFallout 2 is really a great sequel. Certainly it isn\\'t fascinating and revolutionary as the first Fallout, and could be better. But it\\'s still a great classic RPG and a masterpiece.… ExpandOne of best games in My life, real Fallout, real RPG, real game with big soul!I started with three and didn\\'t play this until after a third play through of 4, so I can say without bias that this game is a gem and, like the first, is head and shoulders above the modern installments of the franchise. Knocked a point off, because the combat is far too random at times. You can have the best stats, gear, positioning, companions, ext. and still die four times in a row because of critical hits. That\\'s not difficulty, that\\'s bad game design lol Other than that this game is a masterpiece.I played more than 1000 games. I played some of them for just 10 minutes, some of them for years. Fallout 2 is the best game I\\'ve ever played definitely.Every single aspect of this game, make it a MASTERPIECE.\\nAmazing atmosphere\\nexcelent sound\\ndetailed graphics\\nengaging story\\nbrilliant dialogue\\ncomplete freedom to do whatever you want how you want..\\nFundamental title to have in every pc game colection\\nI wasn\\'t a RPG gamer at all before fallout 2, but after the experience\\nits teh only thing worth playing.My favourite game all-time, all platforms. This game was ahead of it\\'s time and the re-playability is very high! Graphics, dialogue, gameplay, back-story is top notch. If you like RPGs you have to play this game, you\\'ll love it!Nothing short of superb - it takes \"Fallout,\" expands upon it, enriches it, enhances it in so many ways that it makes one feel as if the original was immature.Played it about 6 times. Bethesda will never make a Fallout game as good as it was.this is the best fallout game out of all of them, and might be the greatest RPG of all time.  this and the first one are the only ones you need to play.  if you like modern games then 3 and New Vegas are okay.  Avoid Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, those are terrible.Best game I have ever played.\\n\\nIt is dated now, yet the story and true open world make this a groundbreaking and pinnacle of the gaming industry. Yet to be reproduced, although many have tried.\\n\\nWant to be civilizations savior? No problem, drug addicted pron star? OK.Whichever way you choose, it is your choice.The second part has become more convenient, more and more diverse than the first part. But it was a step aside, she did not greatly developed a series of games, simply complemented. Tim Kane left somewhere in the middle of the development-because of this, such problems with the balance: the appearance of a new power armor, which can also be stolen in the first 15 minutes of the game, a Gaussian, which can be gained 5 minutes earlier.\\nBut on the other hand, this is the case when you pass the first part and ask - \"the same soup, but more.\" The game did not greatly change the gameplay, focusing on the new story and it turned out to be interesting.\\nIt is a pity that this is the last game in the Fallout series ...This the best RPG game I\\'ve ever seen. The choices you made are clearly solid and effective. Also I love how game is making it hard for you but in fair way. You need to find your path, choose your priorities and make decisions. It\\'s all on you, you may be controlling a virtual character but it\\'s actually you... the pure form of you.Just the best RPG out there. Of them all.\\nChoices, humour, lots of dark and twisted stuff you can do, even the armwrestling that can go wrong on so many levels.\\nGreat companions and good storyline.Best Game Ever, Fallout is truely the best example of a RPG experience , with a madmax-like world , its just awsome ..all the humor and gore-ish ambiance ..it still has to be toped in my book .This is the best game i have played to date it has been hard to enjoy anything else because it is so good.One of the best games ever. Beyond comparison with Bethe$da\\'s crappy work.Best RPG ever!!!!!Fallout 1 but with much more depth and variety it is just the best ever RPG.This truly non-linear RPG set in the dark post-apocalyptic future based on the \\'1950s culture and filled with well-known pop-references is still an unmatched example of gameplay and atmosphere one game can offer. Pure 10.Best RPG ever!!!!!FO2? Even better than the first and favorite rpg game to date. No others came in comparison... especially to its wry sense of humor.Fallout 2 is like water in a wasteland - a symbol of hope for anyone that an epic RPG can be achieved. Fallout 2 creates a fully engaging world of a seemingly mistfit reality with all points improved apon from the original. With chacter development nothing less than mind-tingling, gameplay interaction beyond amazing, freedom of action more than what the imagination would allow, and such superior gameplay plot and flow that the most modern games would shy away, Fallout 2 is the most memorable RPG game to have ever been concieved, on par with the Baldur\\'s Gate series.Best RPG ever. Very unique.Even though it is almost a decade old, in my mind this was STILL the single best role playing game every created period.',\n",
       " \"Uffff. Just finished the game! Seriously you guys have nailed it ⚡️ I’m usually not easily shaken. But this game knew how to play with meI must say that for me, it is the horror game of the year.\\n\\nGraphics: 10/10\\nThe graphics department is incredible, everything looks very realistic, and is taken care of to the extreme. There are no objects that pass through walls, and there is none in the scene that are not taken care of in extreme detail. It shows that nothing was done in a hurry, and I think that one of the points that makes each element have maximum detail, is that there are no purchased asset packages and everything you see in the game was created and worked by themselves. That adds a lot of points when it comes to differentiating itself from generic games, with generic assets.\\n\\nSound: 10/10\\nThis section is the one that plays the most important role in the game in order to make it a true horror game.\\nIt's a delight to notice the different layers of sound that the game offers. The 3D sound makes the immersive element sublime, and it features a random sound system that makes the atmosphere of the game always haunting, providing a sensation of extreme suspense.\\n\\nGameplay: 10/10\\nTotally enjoyable, with unique mechanics, achieving its very own identity. It perfectly mixes the use of the camera as a main element both to advance in the story and solve puzzles, as well as to serve as a defense weapon.\\nIt combines psychological horrror and survival horror in a perfect manner.\\nAnother point in favor in the gameplay section is that it has collectibles that you can obtain throughout the game, and it features an achievement system that (for fans of playing through a game 100%) is very satisfying, and allows one to replay the game to get them all.\\nAs a last point in this section, regarding replayability, the game implements a system that when played again, all the puzzles, scares and others, change, making the experience of playing the game a bit different each time.\\n\\nStory 10/10\\nWhat is a good horror game without a good story behind it?\\nIn this case, the game has a highly profound story, where the player dives into other rich sub-stories.\\nThese are not separated by chapters, which is appreciated, but they progressively converge and merge with the main storyline in an exceptional way.\\n\\nAnd a special mention to the voice actors who actually ACT and not just narrate like in other games.\\n\\nMADiSON 10/10\\nI believe that this horror game doesn't come as a successor of any other, and in fact, it has truly managed to find its own identity, and I firmly believe that it will establish itself as a horror classic.The terror this game generated in me cannot be put into words. It was cometely worth it though.. The way the story unfolded, and took me all throught that awful house, I was completely hooked from the start. Each element, each room, they all have its purpose and the best one of all has to be the camera. I’d never played a game that used an item in a way that extended the puzzles’ possibilities so much.Cannot say enough good things about this one!Pros:  Nice graphics and atmosphere.  Decent story.Cons: Puzzles arent really a part of the story. There is no reason putting pictures on the wall according to their correct age makes any sense to why a door will open.  Instead of knocking a cupboard open with a hammer you literally have to find bolt cutters to cut something as thin as a paperclip. This rigidity just demonstrates the lack of agency or creativity. You do what the developer wants you to do (and why would someone put a band of metal on a desk drawer handle instead of using a padlock or something…oh right, the developer needed a quick way to throw a puzzle into the game)Inventory system makes no sense. There are Resident Evil style storage boxes in a game that’s not even survival horror. You are limited to about eight items which causes you to needlessly have to backtrack because the developer wants you to knock tiles loose with a hammer rather than prying them with the crowbar. Again, there is no reason to have the RE style storage boxes.  Items just randomly spawn based on progress inside of areas you’ve already visited. No indication that you need to go back to suddenly find a key that wasn’t there before. You might waste 30 minutes mindlessly searching.Finally there are too many jumpscares. The end of the game turns into Spooky’s House of Jump Scares, literally giving you a random jolt about every three to four minutes. It quickly went from scary to completely pissing me off. Look, the game has a good story and atmosphere, I wont deny that.  It’s just too bad horrible puzzles that lead to horrible pacing get in the way.  It’s also a six hour game for $35. I don’t feel it was worth the value.  I won’t even remember playing this game by the end of the year.… ExpandOverhyped, underdeveloped dross. There are a few interesting puzzle ideas here and there, and a few elements in part of the story had me intrigued, but those are the only nice things I have to say.Most of the puzzles are atrocious and tedious, the entire game suffers from the trope of nonsense architecture, the voice acting is laughably bad (and not in the fun campy way), the story is all over the place and conflicts with itself often, vast swaths of character choices go unchallenged and make no sense, and probably most damning of all... it's not scary.  Anyone can startle with flashing lights, scare chords, and loud noises, but this game isn't remotely scary. This is clearly a horror game inspired by Bloober Team, which is a shame because they are one dev whose homework NO ONE should be copying. Cliched, trope heavy, bad story, stupid characters, you've seen this all before folks. Hard pass.… ExpandA breath of fresh air since 'Visage' (almost on par, as well, unlike a lot of garbage indie horrors being pumped out)...This game definitely has it's share of eerie atmospheres in several areas, startles/noises, scares, puzzles, all loaded in a game. The puzzles don't hold your hand for the most part, but rely on memory, pictures, notes, etc...The graphics look great which is definitely a plus especially for Horror. The story reels you in as it starts to unfold. I had to take my headphones off sometimes because it was non-stop goose-bumps, and daring myself to continue.Excellent game!!Fantastic game! I can honestly say this was a scary game. My son and I played it together and we were jumpy the entire time! Great job to the developers.The best horror game I played in a long time.Finally a horror game that meets what it has to do, scare.Loved it!! Puzzles + Horror . And Let me tell you.... THOSE PUZZLES OMGWe need MADiSON 2 please!I'd been waiting for this game to come out for ac ouple of years, and I'm really pleased with the result that the devs put out. Played it straight in one go and the experience was incredible.\\nThe atmosphere is key, achieved by a combination of sound/music and graphics that really excels.\\nI can't think of other titles that had got me so deeply into the gameplay and narrative, it also provides the right amount of intriguing puzzles which i definitely enjoyed.\\nI keep thinking that both the main story and the secondary ones have a lot left to deliver, hopefully they work on a sequel or anything that develops this universe.\\nI really didn't find any disappointing aspects. Really well done and cheers to the devs!What a great game, the terror that makes you feel is on another level!. Please guys keep making more games like this in the future.I screwed up.Excellent game just for 2 people above Argentina PaBest horror game EVER. Creepy af!!

Really scary gameMasterpiece! keep the good work guys. This really give me chills. Blue knees is creepy afThe game is just very horrible and amateurish. The developers also come across as very unfriendly. The camera sway in it is ridiculous and just shows they really have no clue about game development. It's also far overpriced. Just get Visage instead.To be honest MADiSON is one of the best horror games that recently released. It's got a bone chilling story combined with well thought out mind engaging puzzles. All that happens while you're being actively filled with dread that comes from places you visit in this game. The only thing that annoyed me a bit is the small amount of items you can carry.Madison is a horror game that takes advantage of the style presented by P.T.There in 2014. With an interesting and mechanical story that do not bring any news, the game can support themselves thanks to some good times and the plot.The graphs are satisfactory, but the rate of frames per second may suffer falls at timesIt's a very short game. No replayability.\\nVery boring common walking sim.\\nLOUD = SCARY is tired.\\nand Too many bugs.\\nDon't waste your money.\\n\\nAs you can see from the reviewer name, its a rigged score.nice game but i got a big bug at the end :C\\n\\ni have checked the 6 gramophones over and over, even restarted game and still getting only one eyewow. just wow. the best horror game i've ever played. that blue knees is soo creepyThe terror I expected, the best of this 2022 with respect to a horror game, to my point of view, is better than visage ... expandI can say that it is the best horror game of the year 2022. It gave really good horror moments, I hope the game will continue.One of the best horror games of recent times, it is worth mentioning graphic quality, impeccable sound design, sinister setting, well -constructed and engaging narrative, and very interesting puzzles (in this respect only good rewards).Good Game in general, good envrioment, the puzzles are fine, but some items and things are just inconsistent, need get better in some things but is playable and enjoyble. And in one night you can get your horror dosis.Goodardo.Excellent I shit all the truth.Argentina have papa talent\",\n",
       " 'Loving this game , breath of fresh air - very addictive , one thing is I wish it had better graphics although they are good but could be much better - gameplay is awesome - sequel I hope is UE5Exactly what a next gen game is supposed to be! Awesome graphics, badass combat (excuse my language), gorgeous visuals, intriguing story, and AMAZING use of the haptic feedback control that not enough developers utilize!Very fun game, would highly recommend, if you want to experience something new, but not too difficult. Overall i\\'ts way better (more polished, actually fun) than Elden Ring.It is very amusing game and has a fun and interesting gameplay and it is very unique and loved it so muchVery good and very well done game remembers a lot with what I work.Powers The way the spirit world is shown is sensational.Fantastic game! Unique in all the right ways. Great exploration, combat and atmosphere. Highly recommend this game. Also, if controls feel sluggish try adjusting camera acceleration to 85 and deceleration to 80 then whatever sensitivity you like. Helped a ton.If you live horror games & supernatural with amazing Gameplay with Japanese culture this game for you & my advice go but it great gameIt iscvery amusing game and i really loved it and it is very unique and has a stylish gameplayThis game is absolutely awesome I love it its very unique! The graphics are so releastic and the city of Tokyo omg such a great atmosphere. Well done Bethesda!Really enjoying this game.  The aesthetic is very colorful and stylish and really appeals to my eye.  The enemy variety is top notch and the game is populated some very cool ghosts.  The sidequests are very solid as well, with some being excellent.  Bosses are also a highlight.  Overall recommended.  I give it an 8.5.  But since some losers are giving this game a zero, which is ridiculous!  I gave it a 10 to counterbalance.Ignore every Russian review, they are not even allowed to play this game. Gaming companies have isolated them from rest of the world and for a good reason. This game is not even sold in Russia. If you are from Japan, Europe or USA, enjoy this game! It has nice graphics and fun boss fights. One of the more unique games from 2022.It\\'s almost exactly what i expected. For me, The Evil Within 1 is near masterpiece, The Evil Within 2 is absolute trash and i feel like Ghostwire Tokyo takes more elements from the first game. It\\'s not exactly horror game like The Evil Within, but it definitely has some horror elements here and there. Overall graphics are nice, atmosphere is amazing, Tokyo is very unique place for a video game and i wish more games took place in Japan. Bosses have very unique design as well, cool game.A good effort from tango studio. Like the overall setting but felt a bit boring for me after a while.Great graphics, unique artsyle and cool use of magic through your fingers as a first person shooter. Love the Japanese city, theme and culture. Definitely get if you liked evil within 1 and 2.To me, this game is practically everything I could want. I am absolutely enthralled by Japanese folklore and mythology as well as so desperately hoping to one day visit Japan. This game combines the detailed world building of virtual tourism with the ookey spookums of Japanese myths and urban legends. On top of that, it sports a fancy engine that makes everything shine and pop and looks wonderful. My one and only gripe is the wonky controls of the first person camera. I don\\'t really understand why it feels so awkward to look around. But it\\'s such a minor issue that I really don\\'t even think about it much at all. It\\'s easily a 10/10 for me.It\\'s the same boring, run-of-the-mill open world stuff. At least it has some japanese stuff instead of ubisoft towers, but the story is so uninspired that even the nice visuals look bland after a while.Japanese porn videogame, a beautiful and mystical world just for Japanese culture fans, generic history, but a lot of secundary quest and items to collect with interesting information about yokais, traditional stories, etc. Probably, the game need best accesibility options update like camera speed, pixeling in some lights and shadows, in the cinematics the fps... But its extremely beautiful and fresh!Decent enough love the mechanics, story’s predictable and the game’s boring when you’ve finished it.This game\\'s graphics are not HFW level but still good. Story and combat is nice but ending is heartbreakingGW:T is an amazing first-person action adventure game where you explore the beautifully detailed streets of Shibuya in search of lost Shiba Inu to pet and feed. Check hidden alleyways and dumpsters to find money and purchase more dog food, then get back out there to keep scratching and feeding. There are some other, secondary elements to the game such as exploration to find more dogs, fighting ghosts off to protect the dogs, and cleansing shrines to unlock access to more of the city so you can feed and pet more dogs. I think there’s a storyline too but it didn’t have as many dogs in it so that’s probably an afterthought. Overall 7/10 on dog rendering and details, 10/10 on petting and feeding animation, and 13/10 for being able to talk to dogs rounding out to an absolute 10/10 overall.Good graphics; nice main quest story; loved the Japanese ghost/spirit theme; side quests are nice tales;  combat is cool and enjoyable even it may feel repetitive;  for me is a 10/10 and the objective point of view  8.5/10.Nice ghost hunter game, stunning visuals and overall good gameplay once you set up the controller right. Good side missionsI understand some of the frustrations with this game and its core battle mechanics being a bit repetitive but personally it does two things for me that I really put a lot of value in and thats build a world that feels alive and provides contained experience that still gives me the freedom to get around how i like.\\n\\nIf you are anything like me and looking to get back to Japan but unable to do so while the borders are locked up, this game does scratch a strange itch. Everything is oddly familiar without needing to be an exact branded replica and its the first time I have hoped for a Bethesda game to make its way to PSVR 2 when it releases.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a reasonably chilled, story driven treasure hunt of a game. Give this a go.it\\'s a little repetitive but it\\'s still an excellent and fun experience. Congratulations to Mikami and TangoGameworks.Ah, what a game…I’ve been waiting for Ghostwire Tokyo since it’s first announce. And preordered it the first minute of being able to preorder, that’s why I had a chance to play it 3 days earlier.For me, as a fan of horror, especially Japanese horror, Japanese aesthetics this game is just something✨I enjoy just walking around the beautiful streets of abandoned Tokyo, looking at thousands details, meeting familiar ghost stories and ghost tales, and enjoying the main story.There’s no microtransactions, no lgbt/feminism agenda and no any kind of cancer of a game industry.It’s a kind of a game which I really missed for many years. Around ~20 hours in the game so far, and I enjoy every second of it.I understand, that this game will not sell good.I understand, that it’s easy to criticise that game.But also I understand that I will get back to this paranormal world again. And again. That game means a world to me.And will stay forever in my heart.I love you, Tango Gameworks.Thank for getting me out of depression.And thank you for making me not to lose interest in videogames even during such hard times as now.Please, don’t stop making such unique projects. We really need it.Mr. SimonSetanable good yes, gaes, james mo platinumin gaes because ez plate cuk.mwekekekekeIt\\'s a very Very unique experience to be sure. I enjoy the stunning city and have had No problems.If you love japanese folklore, magic, spirits and demon-hunting action with RPG elements and the possibility of exploring Tokyo streets then this game is for you. I strongly advise on PS5 the HFR Quality Mode with V-Sync, solid 45 FPS and nice graphics..    .    . .    .    . .    .    .  ..    .    .    . .    .    . .    .    .  .. Nice gameThe game is awesome. Sometimes I feel I am using my own hands. The story is very short but very amazingThe atmosphere in Tokyo is fantastic. It feels like I\\'m using my hand. I like the gameplay and the graphics. The variety of enemies is very good. His editing is successful. Congratulations to the production team.This is proof to never let critical feedback sway your decision to buy a game.Never have the streets of Tokyo felt so authentic. Futhermore, they are soaked with deeply interesting and mysterious yokai. An awesome plot and a likeable protagonist are keeping me hooked and I can power through it with a very unique, beautiful combat systemABSOLUTELY STUNNING. figures an Xbox studio can produce a masterpiece like this. That\\'s the ONLY reason Playstation contracted year of exclusivity. Because their trash heap line up of gt7 and forbidden west failed epically.Good-\\nHas such an interesting premise that hooks me right away. The story is engaging almost the entire way through. KK and Akito are an amazing buddy cop type of duo and it is so enjoyable following them. The open world has a very unique atmosphere and is very unique in it\\'s visual identity. The exploration is so fun to just mess around in. The side quests honestly out shadow the main quests most of the time. Main quests are still well done most of the time. The combat is enjoyable and fast paced. Kind of like an FPS but with magic. The progression is straightforward and fun. Looks and runs well enough. Audio design is solid.\\n\\nBad-\\nThe actual stuff in the open world outside of quests is just another checklist open world game. The voice acting and dialogue can be a bit cringy (I did play with english voices tho). While the visuals are okay, it doesn\\'t look like a PS5 exclusive type game in terms of graphics. The combat, while fun, does get repetitive at times\\n\\nThoughts-\\nWhile it falls prey to many trappings of modern open world games, Ghostwire: Tokyo does so much in such a uniquely distinct way that it still stays with you. Though it’s formulaic and relies on certain design tropes, the veneer wrapped around all of that still makes it feel like a very unique experience. In a few months from now, when I think back on Ghostwire: Tokyo, that it has a “clear the map” open world probably won’t be the thing that sticks with me- it will be how unique its tone and atmosphere are, how fun its combat it is, how eerie and psychedelic the experience feels, or how strangely affecting its quests could often be. And ultimately, that uniqueness is its biggest asset, even when it is paradoxically at odds with so much of its design being straightforward and mundane.Excellent spooky recreation of Tokyo. Gameplay is creative and effective. Characters could be more developed.I enjoyed the aesthetic of this game so much and the gameplay might be lacking in some places it sure makes up for it with the world you\\'re in!Great game, both its game mechanics, the setting of the city is incredible, the gameplay is good, I liked it a lot.a completely new experience and very unique gameplay maybe the first of it\\'s kind reminds me of the shinobi\\'s hand signs in naruto from the first person perspective the game also delivers a rich world during the winter nights of Tokyo graphics looks sick with colorful lights and reflections and with a souce of heavy rain from time to time the story is a mix of horror and drama. in general, the game is awesome and i strongly recomond it.This is a good game GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGThis game is amazing, strong advice from me - IGNORE negative reviews. These people have zero idea what they are talking about.I love this game ! Sure it has some same rpg elements from other games but who the hell cares ! The game is gorgeous ! The weaving is super cool ! I feel like a super cool anime character and the main mission is cool ! I really enjoy the side missions too . There’s some really great side quests . Some very funny too like the one where  a spirit can’t move on because he doesn’t have toilet paperExcellent game, with new mechanics and atmosphere very well built.I just didn\\'t give 10 depending on the FPS drop in quality mode with RT.Ghostwire: Tokyo One has one of the best visual design ever! I awesome when i see so impressive Japanese style , that depends on game - is very good , awesome story and gameplay , i\\'ve really enjoyed it, On PlayStation 5 graphics is breathtaking , so there can be better framerate , but its ok. Now Ghostwire is good exclusive for PS5A spiritual experience. This title, I think will be one of the most sought after when the PSVR2 can allow its application.In a context where the possibility is available to the player to take the time to explore and understand Japanese faith.It is a unique, innovative and significant title in terms of content wealth.Mystical, spiritual and sacred, we feel from the Dualsens controller in hand the privilege of immersion in the city of Tokyo.The dualsens is well exploited and we feel the subtleties of the environment.The graphics are breathtaking of radical changes in the action where the decoration and the scene becomes an even more significant effect in the immersion of the game during places of quest. Felications for this reckless title, it is a video-blistical titleunique that inspires us to understand and respect what surrounds us. BRAVO and thank you for offering us this unique titleIt\\'s a great Game. The Setting is awesome. Tokyo looks great. The gameplay mechanics works fine and the Open world have a lot of funny Activity\\'s.  Really succeeded Game.Flawed but FunComing off of my 90 hour Elden Ring binge my bar was really high so it was only expected to be a little disappointed. I’ll start with the bad first. Cons- Quality mode is nearly unplayable. Well under 30 fps at the highest setting which is disappointing for a PS5 title in 22 when games like Horizon Forbidden West and Ratchet and clank still manage the 30 on highest settings. However like all those titles Performance mode runs at a stable 60 fps- Confusing map. The developers definitely took a page out of Ubisofts book and created a map littered with icons that remove a good chunk of natural exploration which is unfortunate. Worse off however is the fact that the map lacks any level of layers for elevation making determining where some objectives like finding Yokai in the world frustrating. At the 6 hour mark your map will be more icons than map. Graphical issues. The game suffers from heavy pop in which is usually expected in open world games however when a character you’ve seen in a cutscene is out of frame momentarily only to show up again and have to load all their textures it can be quiet jarring. Pros. World. Getting to explore the greater Shibuya area is fantastic. Narrow alley ways give way to hidden shrines and enemy encounters. Climbing to the tallest buildings in the area reward you will sweeping visitas giving you a chance not only to breath but to look at the next place of interest you feel like poking around in. At first the semi linear nature of the map was worrying but it quickly opens up as you explore more of the area and cleanse more shrines therefore opening up even more areas of exploration. I constantly find myself getting distracted from main objectives because I see the hint of something else just around the corner. Its a world that is easy to get lost in which can be rare in most open world games that give you a cookie cutter map to explore filled with procedurally generated terrain. Combat. If you’ve ever wanted to roleplay a Japanese teenager role playing Dr strange this is the game for you. The more powers and tools you unlike you begin to play a dance with the enemies flipping through powers like guns in a Doom shooter. Enemies provide a good challenge without being overwhelming which is a testament to the team at Bethesda for creating wonderful difficulty selections. My one gripe is there is a lack of a dodge button. A simple side step would have added a much needed level of movement to a slightly stiff system. Graphics. I know this was also in the cons list, but at times this game is a visual masterpiece. The neon of Tokyo and the mystical powers you get are extremely flashy and only get more impressive the better you get with them. Overall it’s a fun game. I went in looking for Japanese legends and myths in an action horror environment and it delivers just that even with its flaws. If you’re unsure of if you want to play it, wait for a sale, if you are craving a break from Elden Ring and want a slightly more casual romp through an open world Tokyo absolutely give this game a shot.Elden Ring was awful, so i was little bit worried that maybe this game goes same route as well, that has horrible combat where you need to fight one boss 5000 times to learn their moves and all that nonsense. Thankfully this game has none of that, in fact Ghostwire Tokyo is actually fun game to play, how about that. Really like the atmosphere, monster design and graphics, haven\\' finished it yet, but first few hours have been very nice.So far, this is the best game of 2022. It\\'s more fun, polished, professionally made and unique than Dying Light 2, Elden Ring and Horizon Forbidden West. Not too easy, not too difficult, interesting creature design choices. Tokyo is amazing setting for a video game. Would recommend.The atmosphere in this game is just perfect. Really good graphics, nice campaign story…Excellent Xbox Game Studios game, thanks to the pipes you will arrive at Xbox without errors, day one in Game Pass.Original and interesting. Finally something new! The art style is amazing, and the combat system is a breath of fresh airI think the devs did a great job with the world design and the overall supernatural atmosphere of the game. Could learn a thing or two about the Japanese culture while you\\'re roaming the streets of Tokyo looking for collectibles and whatnot. I think that was a neat idea. Story is alright. Combat can get a bit tedious and repetitive and you\\'ll find yourself dealing with enemies the same way alot of the times. I dont mind it though. The game isn\\'t great but it\\'s not a bad game either. Also it does have english audio but by default the game starts in Japanese with English subtitles and I would highly recommend keeping it that way. Makes the dialogue and environment seem a bit more authentic and immersive. Overall I feel this is a \"wait for a sale\" type of game if you\\'re interested but dont have the 60-70 dollars to spare.Unlike most games released in 2022, Ghostwire Tokyo is one of the few that manages to be actually fun. Metacritic strongly needs similar filter to Rotten Tomatoes, where you have to prove that you actually bought the game, because otherwise Elden Ring bots will downvote every new game, because they can\\'t deal with the fact, that most people are not interested playing games where you have to die 1000 times to progress and instead want to play normal games like Ghostwire Tokyo.Great gameplay Great graphicsAmazing atmosphereVery good voice acting especially in japaneseGood storyPerformance could have been better on pcThe setting of this game is undoubtedly the best to play it.If you love the Japanese culture and its spirits of its flolklore, do not hesitate.Tokyo\\'s care is made in detail, all its neighborhoods, a great job behind him.I expected Ghostwire Tokyo, and the title of Tango and Bethesda has not disappointed me.His gameplay is one of the coolest formulas we have had in recent years.The sound section is very achieved both in environmental effects and in music itself.\\nIts history fulfills what it promises, with a deep plot that makes you empathize and understand the deepest feelings and human concerns attached to very complete secondary schools of Japanese folklore.\\nA cover and essential this year 2022Ghostwire Tokyo could ve been a masterpiece but cannot decide what it wants to be. The open world feels amazing and stunning at times but it is also boring and very empty. Story narration and supernatural events are driving this game but the combat system does not hold up, same goes to the tedious trophy progression and the clustered open world objectives.\\n\\nThe visuals are mostly great but at times the framerate dips even in performance mode and especially facial animations as well as hair are at times so bad that it cuts heavily to the overall quality of the game. The love to Tokyos detail is amazing and I would love to actually see this open world being used in a different game where it starts to live because it shows the passion the creators put in it.\\n\\nOverall I felt very torn on Ghostwire Tokyo. The atmosphere is amazing and I did enjoy my time but at the same time I felt bored because the gameplay is just not really great, maybe could be considered good. I do respect the approach the creators went for. Personally I would ve liked a bit more enemy variety and some quality of life improvements to the open world itself. Skill variety does not have to be overloaded but it is too flatlined to keep you interested. If you do like japanese culture, tokyo and supernatural stuff the game probably will satisfy you. If you are looking for an action or great open world game you probably will be disappointed. I would recommend to grab the game on a discount for maybe around 50 bucks. Full price does not seem to fit well in my personal opinion.Boring and repetitive combat, empty city which is uninteresting to explore, annoying platformer elements, waste of your time and money.Very simple and repetitive combat, environment can be little explored, missions and items to be collected are very repetitive and the graphics leave to be desired.\\n\\nThe game setting is a plus point.An action-horror platformer with a little light immersive sim on the side, Ghostwire: Tokyo is surprisingly light on the scares and saves any attempts at unsettling you for story setpieces. The devs said they made Ghostwire as a love letter to Japan, and it shows: rather than trying to throw constant unease at you in the semi-open world the way Evil Within 2 did, the game immerses you in a modern Shibuya steeped in general national folklore. It does fanservice to the cityscape in a way that is second only to Yakuza, and the game can basically be boiled down to Yakuza-meets-Shin Megami Tensei by way of a first-person horror game. Similar to another game, Control, Ghostwire also levels out the spookiness in order to just sort of let you get lost in exploring the paranormal on a nearly procedural basis. However, with all this out of the way, it\\'s worth noting that the game is fairly short, the collectibles are hit-or-miss by some standards – thus lacking in replayability for some – the story is not particularly strong, and the combat can err on the simplistic and repetitive side, and the roughly 20+ hour playtime may not be for everybody\\n\\nSolid game, but may be worth borrowing or waiting for a deep saleWhat a trash game. Absolute garbage :banderas:\\n\\nIn my opinion that nobody asked or even wantedUndoubtedly, a fairly attractive game, the effects, animations, design of enemies, magic, magic execution animations, the details of the city, etc., are quite good, the story is also good without becoming excellent ordeep.All the aforementioned elements are weight so that those players who do not look for something very hardcore are pleased, but;Personally (and obviously it should not be a maximum for everyone) I lack something, let\\'s say that for some reason I expected it to be more open and accessible since there are some elements that stop your exploration a bit.On the other hand, the gameplay is good but not excellent, the type of combat could have been more spectacular as in Deathloop (that if it has a better fight) and with more epic battles.In summar, it is not a bad game, but I recommend that you wait for it to go down price, there are currently more priority options such as Horizon, Elden, Triangle Strategy.Overall visuals and presentation are great aside from the forced motion blur and lack of FOV slider, gameplay however gets stale quickly and the game becomes a chore with all the monotonous map marker missions. Id wait a bit for a sale, very meh experience.It\\'s your call but for now it\\'s not recommended.\\n1/10 this game at that stage.Not really understanding the 10s as this game is actually worse than a Ubisoft open world.\\nThey should get an award for making a game as boring as this considering the sheer number of icons on the map. They actually surpassed Ubisoft in that regard.\\n\\nInteraction? Forget it. Think Division with nobody to talk to and endless empty streets.\\nInnovation? Nope unless you think doing the same thing repeatedly thousands of times is innovative. They didn\\'t even try to mix it up so your options when it comes to what passes as combat are very limited.\\n\\n5 for graphics and outdoing Ubisoft and minus 5 for everything else.\\n\\nIt really feels like the trailer we saw at E3 in 2019 (remember they showed people vanishing and leaving behind their clothes) was all they actually had as a premise and based on the response they got to making a game around it because it doesn\\'t look like they had anything aside from a trailer. You\\'ll notice that as you play.\\n\\nAlso don\\'t expect to finish this game expecting to be told why certain things you do had to be done because they don\\'t even explain why you are the only person to keep your mind in your body.\\n\\nAlso don\\'t expect a horror game. This is more whimsical and whacky slapstick horror hence the rating.\\n\\nAnd the outright 10s for this game must be people who have never played an open world game or they are just kids because at most this deserves a 5. Trust me the only way this game is going to win a game of the year award is if the developers and publishers of other games just vanish into a void very much like the people in this game and nothing else is released this year!This game is complete garbage. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. The greedy developers were too lazy to make the combat deep. When I pay $60, I expect a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty colorful lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. Speaking of combat, there is a combat style that is extremely cringeworthy. It consists of the protagonist shooting \"ammo\" with a hand gun gesture. What is he, a manchild? The physics are trash. The graphics are outdated for a next-gen AAA game.\\n\\nFor goodness sake, why are video game developers so obsessed with adding bows and arrows into almost every game? Enough already. This just goes to show how out of touch these developers are with gamers. I don\\'t know a single gamer that actually cares or talks about bow and arrows. Hunters would be more interested in bow and arrows, not gamers. Even then, almost every hunter I know prefers guns over bows. It\\'s no wonder why an almost 9 year old game like GTA V continues to outperform modern games in sales. Speaking of GTA, there are so many cars parked around the city and you can\\'t even drive any of them. The developers were too cheap and lazy to add driving mechanics. Even the newest Kirby game lets you drive a car, and that\\'s where it makes less sense to have cars. That\\'s embarrassing. The story is horrible. The lazy developers used the story as an excuse to make the open world empty and lifeless.\\n\\nThere is no multiplayer. So once you beat the main story, this game will go back to the shelf and collect dust. Charging $60 for game with no replay value is a cash grab. The developers were too greedy and lazy to give us multiplayer. I only recommend you buy this game until it is $5.A more detailed review will come soon, but for now this is just a weird looking game void of any imagination or creativity.\\nIt\\'s neither horror nor sci fi, nor mystery, and not even a wasted potential. In fact, I can\\'t believe somebody could\\'ve green lighted this project.\\nMuch as I love Japanese games, this one is really impossible to enjoy.\\nJust as scary as a dancing origamis or flame-throwing sushi could be.\\nCome on, guys! Seriously?\\nWhy not give us Evil within 3 instead, or start another gory franchise like the first Evil Within?\\nI was stupid enough to pre-order this, but now when I look at it, only on sale this could\\'ve been less disappointing.I liked it very much, thanks, played on YouTube, I can still be immensely gratefulworst game I\\'ve ever played if this game wasn\\'t a timed PlayStation 5 excusive no one would be hyping this up the most boring combat and dumbest story ever only get if your a PlayStation fanboyIt is obvious that it is the best action game because it came out first on PS, it is the best of the wicked, you do not need to say your characteristics is simply good and possible Goty because it came out first in PlayStations.\\nThat\\'s why I give him a 100 of 100.Bought because of sting. But apart from the setting, there is nothing good in this game. Boring story and gameplay. I do not recommend.Very bland. Nice recreation of Tokyo. The quests need to much more creative. They ultimately are fetch quests at the end.Slotted a rare game for Japanese fetishists who love to smell the panties of girls ... Expandah yes!, another exclusive game and another refund request, it\\'s very bland but a nice recreation of Tokyo, the quests not creative enough. it\\'s ultimately fetch quests at the end wait till it\\'s free on gamepass the only place it deserves to be thereNo third person,the game is repetitive and has a boring storyline. Simply giving my point of view. No cap. Not my cup of teaReally great game!  I like the unique “First Person Shooter” game play. Graphics look good. Great on P5 now with VRR.  Fun.This game is so bland, it vanilla icecream the game,it\\'s white paint, nothing stands out, nothing excites the player to entice a sale...This is why sex apoeal use to be mixed with horror. The mix of the good with the bad drew you in , hot woman and gore , sex and violence,  it peaks interest...This game has 2 of the most generic looking Asian guys as characters,  a pretty environment and a bunch of genericly creepy monsters,. But no sexy lead, no Heather, no sexy nurse creatures , no 7 foot vampire woman with her sexy witch daughters no fit wife that chops you hand off, or slim wierdo southern teen.. Horror games devs use to get  how to do horror but now with every game being  made for the Anita Sarkesians of the world every game is dull and Vanilla.Honestly I would rather the messy, badly designed style of Resident Evil 6 than this boring new horror game.My hopes were pretty high with this one as it seemed so unique in the trailers and I really enjoyed the evil within games. Overall I think ghostwire is a very good game but has a lot of issues.\\n\\nThe art design is phenomenal. I\\'ve never seen such an authentic recreation of Tokyo in a game. I felt like I was there. The convenience stores, bathhouses, the buildings, the way businesses stack on top of each other... it\\'s incredibly impressive. And this extends to the monster design and animations as well. It all looks very impressive. However, I had to switch it to performance mode as it was a bit jarring in the pre selected quality mode. I needed the higher framerate.\\n\\nThe combat is fun but a lot of that is down to the incredible looking animations. Typically fights involve me backing away and pressing R2 to shoot my finger guns. It\\'s a little too basic. You have a bow and talismans but ammo for each is rarer so odds are you\\'re just going to shoot your finger guns for most of the game... it gets kind of old around the midway point but I never dreaded combat though so that\\'s a plus. The bosses mostly sucked though... like you end up in a very cool arena with an amazing looking monster but... then I just end up shooting at them like any old enemy. They were kind of boring to fight.\\n\\nI enjoyed a lot of the sidequests. I loved how they dived into different urban legends or aspects of Japanese culture. I think they could have used a few more unique fights at the end though.\\n\\nThe open world design is probably the weakest aspect. The map is just littered with collectibles. There\\'s no real incentive to explore. The trophy list was kind of offputting as well. I initially figured I\\'d go for the platinum but later realized it would be too much of a hassle. Collect 240,000 spirits, get 20 headshots with a bow, find all of the many many collectibles etc... it just felt like a lot of busywork.\\n\\nOverall a really interesting game and a fun one overall but at the same time kind of a letdown. Hopefully the next game from tango is better.Ghostwire Tokyo is so mega and the Japanese mythology is very well processed in it, there is everything in color creatures and the only thing that bothers me is that the story is quite short and you spend a lot of time to collect ghosts or objects to collect all ubisoft openworldAnother trash, like all nowadays major releases.. Sony imo is almost dead. I probably should sell my ps5.Not sure why this game gets so much negativity. There are no control issues on the PS5, and it runs extremely well. Gameplay is helped by an absolutely gorgeous Tokyo backdrop, which has obviously been lovingly created. There\\'s plenty to do for Completionists like me, and travelling round to see the sights is easy enough. i\\'ts an 8 mostly because of repetetive enemies, but its still a stupidly good game to play.Great game, minus the performance issues which hopefully get sorted with a update or two.Masterpiece!Just gotta tweak some settings. I am gonna leave all the settings here for players who are newly strating or planing to buy it.Vibration - OnAdaptive Triggers - OnLeft Thumb Deadzone: 0Right Thumb Deadzone : 0Aim Assist - OnInvert Camera Axis X/Y Axis - OffCamera Acceleration Speed - 85Camera Deceleration Speed - 80Camera X-Axis Sensitvity - 55Camera Y-Axis Sensitvity - 55Camera Sensitvity (Aiming) - 55Camera Sensitivty (Bow Drawn) - 55Now after playing with these settings you can adjust the settings to whatever you like, tweak it higher or lower according to your comfortibility. Happy Gaming, Gamersonly the story is good. others? a **** really not enjoyed the game the dev surely make a very bad game gameplay is so much look like a 2010 game not like next gen game . really poor and lack of gui.The gameplay is very very bad!!! I did not enjoy playing. On the contrary, I was nauseous. I won\\'t give any spoilers from the story, but it\\'s a disappointment. There is nothing interesting in the game except the graphics. It looks like we have purpose in this game, but it isn\\'t. Stupid missions in a city full of stupid bots.im so angry that i made this account only to write this review.\\n\\nThe world is ok i like tokyo as a setting and the enemy types is cool just not enogh of them. its like 3-4 enemy types for most of the game only with some diffrent hats some times this gets boring fast.\\n\\nthe story is ok the best part off the game. if you want to play this game just play the story and some side quest\\n\\nthe open world gets borring fast and seems to be just added becuase they can. it has nothing to add to the game and its just borring afthe a few houers\\n\\nand then the worst part if you want to 100% this game get readu for HOUERS of NOTHING while you wait for some RANDOM events. SO FUN to go through the empty open world and doing NOTHING thats so fun.\\n\\nthe only thing that i need to get the platinum is 2 Hyakki Yako events. the last one did take 3 HOUERS of nothing to spawn. i did just walk and killed enemyes for more ammo that i dont need. and i still need to do 2 more? this is just stupid. never played a more disrespectful game ever.I was sceptical about this game before getting it because I didn‘t really know what to expect. But I was totally surprised by how good it is. It‘s a proper next gen title, there are not many of these out so far but you notice it in every second that this game was developed for next gen. Looks amazing, fantastic use of the haptic feedback on the Dualsense and delivers an amazing, creepy atmosphere throughout the whole game.Only complain I have about this game: I was playing on performance mode and it couldn‘t hold a consistent 60 fps unfortunately. Most of the time the fps feel like they‘re 40-50. If that doesn‘t bother you, I can only recommend buying this game.amazing game\\ni love this combat system\\nand enemy design\\nvoice actor is very good\\nNice tango game worksIt’s very unique I’m enjoying it very much, a tad simplistic in places but I picked it up half off, worth every penny!Spent the last few evenings playing through Ghostwire Tokyo (PS5). It was just okay. The city and the supernatural ambience are spectacular, especially playing on high frame rate quality mode. But the gameplay itself was so terribly boring that after 25 hours I couldn’t deal with the grindyness anymore and pushed through to finish the story.\\n\\nBy the credit roll, I had finished all the side missions, all the main missions, cleansed all the torii gates, and had collected over half of the (240,000!) souls. That was enough for me to consider the game complete.\\n\\nGhostwire Tokyo simply has far too many checklist collect-a-thons padding out the world. There’s the souls, torii gates, tanuki, Jizo statues, yokai, relics, prayer beads, audio tracks, voice recordings, landmarks, clothing and outfits… It reminded me of the bloated mess the pre-Origins Assassins Creed games had become (looking at you, Assassins Creed Syndicate).\\n\\nIf combat wasn’t so one note, it might have been able to carry the weight of the padded open world. Unfortunately, every single fight, from the first hour to the last, is the same fire-backpedal-circle-strafe-until-everything-is-dead formula. Even the bosses play out this exact same way, except for one which prioritized a stealthy approach.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the performance issues, which persist to this day. Unstable frame rates regardless of which of the graphical modes you choose, frame drops, input lag, screen tearing (even with the vsync mode enabled)...\\n\\nGlad I picked it up on sale. Anyone giving this a 9 or a 10 is delusional. 75% of the world is meaningless collect-a-thon fluff and is the kind of padded nonsense that forced Ubisoft to completely retool their Assassins Creed franchise. It\\'s a relic of last generation game design.20 hours in and I\\'m enjoying every bit about it. The quality graphics mode is something cyberpunk developers can learn from. The gameplay mechanics are very unique and the most important part of the game - city of Tokyo itself is super well detailed and VERY atmospheric. Enjoying the story so far as well and there is a lot to love about japanese folklore.Ghostwire: Tokyo\\nSpoooooookyyy\\nGhostwire Tokyo is an 8 hour plus long first person action game where you play as akito whos been taken over by a spirit after you die.. this spirit offers to help you find your sister if you help him take down this demon… you agree, merge, and now you have these super natural powers…\\nEveryone in Tokyo is dead, there are spirits around this open world that you free by completing optional side activities that also help level you up much quicker in the game… and crawling around this empty city are these creepy demon enemies that you have to blast with your supernatural powers and pull their cores out with your bear hands or with some sort of……. Ghostwire.. .if you stick to the main campaign theres nothing special here… infact the game would be pretty mediocre if you don’t expore its world.. thankfully youll want to… clearing these corrupted trees in your way, clensing these gates to unlock fast ravel points and clear fog to open up the world more… doing some great and also some rigiuclous sidequests which can really immerse you into this world… these are the best moments of ghostwire Tokyo.. immersing yourself into the side activities.. its just a shame youll so quickly grow tired of this world, youll get used to the spooky monsters, the sidequests will start to feel unnecessary.. the skill tree leaves a lot to be desired so youll stop caring about rescuing souls once you’ve unlocked every ability you care about… so youll probably find yourself like me abou halfway through the game jut sticking to the main quests.. which are good.. but nothing to blow you away…  ghostwir Tokyo is fun through.. the combat is tense, youll be juggling through abilities, sneaking up behind enemies trying not to alarm the others… I loved my time spent in this creepy world… my only gripe with conmbat though is this skin crawling nails on chalkboard feeling when you run out of one of the 3 energies and have to switch to another.. I hate it and wish the game would just switch to the next automatically when youre out of one of them… as you do have to destroy glowing items in the environment to refill ammo or pull the cores out of enemies…\\nOverall this is a decently enjoyable action horror game, its unique.. its memorable…\\nWorth hopping into even if it slowly goes from wow this game is amazing to.. that game was pretty good..\\nI give Ghostwire Tokyo\\na 7.5/10A solid game with great exploration, a very fun design and tone, that can go from a relaxing jaunt down backstreets, hunting for tanuki, gathering lost souls, or just exploring, to intense fights against genuinely unsettling foes. Combat gets a bit repetitive though, and some elements just do not work as intended. Definitely worth a buy if on sale, or if you\\'re curious though.User: TheGaming2022 in his metacritic review says, \"So far, this is the best game of 2022. It\\'s more fun, polished, professionally made and unique than Dying Light 2, Elden Ring and Horizon Forbidden West.\" Ghostwire Tokyo is great but saying it\\'s better and more polished than Horizon, Dying Light 2 and Elden Ring is absolutely crazy. It\\'s nowhere near as ambitious as those games. Horizon\\'s size and graphics alone blow it out of the water. Elden Ring has full multi-player with hundreds and hundreds of unique animations, bosses and abilities. It has 10 times more unique places to explore as well. It\\'s not even quite on the same level as Dying Light 2 let alone Elden Ring.Pretty fun game but I must say that it\\'s got a paid with this if it\\'s you try to get everything. I enjoyed my time with the combat was not the most very but it was fun and that\\'s the thing about this game. I like a lot of things about but I don\\'t think any part of it is amazing the good like game you play Once and done and that kindThe 2 games associated with Sony console limited exclusivity 2022 SIFU and Ghostwire Tokyo while i haven’t had the chance to play the firs but Ghostwire is certainly a sleeper hit this year. It shines in level design, gorgeous visuals, story telling, up upgrade system and quality missions and side missions, I thought combat was a bit clunky and at times difficult to keep your aim in check but over all loved it another classic by arkane.Amazing game. I absolutely love the battle mechanics in Ghostwire: Tokyo. It’s a combination of three types of elemental damage, alongside melee strikes and archery. Gust attacks are Akito’s primary source of magic. Leveling up and discovering K.K.’s investigation notes grant skill points. You can upgrade your elemental weaving techniques and melee skills, as well as carrying capacity for arrows and consumables. Very fun! Tolga Özruh....Whilst I can be the first to admit it might not be for everyone.You either are really into the premise and concept or you simply won\\'t get it. I love the themes, spooky imagery and overall dark concept. If you\\'re not fully invested in that the rest won\\'t be enough to carry you through.Even with the controls adjusted it feels stiff and not flowing. Im getting pretty bored after an hour of playtime. It\\'s not really much of a game it\\'s more a walk in tokyo. There are 5 different mobs and the gameplay is very repetivie and boring. Collectables are bugged on the map and hard to find. Cause who tought let\\'s make everything the same f color was a good idea. A tiny bit of sidequest the rest is a boring taks of colleting money to buy redicilouse overprized trash for the trophy you will never use. 130.000 for a emote good luck with that.The most Japanese thing since tenticle porn. It\\'s a Japanese version of Control. I\\'m a couple hours in and I have no idea what is going on.',\n",

       " 'Incredible. This game has evolved into something really special. Everything is on a completely different level. The visuals, the voice acting, the music and all to the best story I\\'ve ever seen in an RPG. Shadowbringers set the stage perfectly for Endwalker to blow our minds and just wowStarting 3 months ago, this has been an exceptional journey. After giving up MMOs two years ago, this has been a gift, being one of the best stories in gaming history and showing that even MMOs can have a wonderful story and incredible gameplay. Especially standing-out the Trial Fights, Job Mechanic and Phase-based Music!This is for certain the best expansion released for an mmo since shadowbringers, lovingly crafted with extreme attention to detail on literally every corner endwalker emerges as a emotional masterpiece that touches your soul with a satisfying conclusion to the arc, it\\'s a labor of love; the music for example is magical and some tracks are a 100% some of the best video game music of all time, it is a must play experience.The best expansion in a mmo with shadowbringers, I can not lower points for people who can not login is something that is solved with the passing of days :)This may be very well the greatest story of modern fiction ever told. A culmination of works building on the scale of JRR Tolkien’s oeuvre. Combined with a lovable ensemble of characters spanning 8 years, along with the strongest main cast of any RPG I’ve played, a soundtrack that brings me to tears, and a whole lot of love from an entire team. I can’t imagine a more perfect final entry to this saga if I tried.Very disappointing overall. It\\'s a shame since ShB was very good and I had high expecations for this. It\\'s unfortunate it falls flat on every level. The new areas are bland and boring in general, as are the dungeons. The story is very slow and a step back to SB which isn\\'t a good thing. The story is full of filler dialogue that I often felt like skipping. This will definitely be my last FF expansion.\\n\\nCompared to previous expansions, I would rate them: ShB > HW > EW > SB > ARRI absolutely love the story and so far have nothing negative to say other than the server issues but that\\'s not a huge issue since I like to play during the AM hours. Definitely a great expansion like the one that came before. Love it!Absolute masterpiece story wise and gameplay. Will be very hard to live up to this expansion.The best queue simulator. With monthly sub!!! Well done, Square Enix! The addon is simply unplayable due to the 3-8 hour queues (sorry, but I only have 1 hour to play in the evening). Best way to waste money... 3 weeks from start and addon still unplayable. And all compensation we got - 7 free days of subAmazing game, the story, characters, jobs, music, ost, trials, feels worth it, and still is coming more content incredible, yeah still have some issues and errors but is not hurting the experience of the gameIt seemed impossible, but they surprised us again. So many good references to Final Fantasy IV.Amazing ending to a saga. Brilliant and beautiful story telling. The best game I\\'ve ever played.This game is just amazing. One of the best experiences of my live.If you like RPG, even if you dont loke MMOs, you should try it.Just when I thought Shadowbringers couldn\\'t be beat, Endwalker comes in and completely BLOWS me away! It is the most cohesive, engaging and polished expansion. The music is phenomenal, the story is riveting and original. The characters and new areas are incredibly intriguing and I could have never expected this game to impact me this way. By far Square Enix and Yoshi-P\\'s best work by miles!In a incredible tour de force; Endwalker manages to proceed to a rather satisfactory ending. While it isn\\'t without fault; and its\\' foundations may even be a little too shaky or rocky given it\\'s newest antagonist, the introduction of Dynamis (lampshaded or not aplenty without a proper name until now), and a few questions or new questions on prior elements like Time Travel; it performs incredibly well.\\n\\nI will say that Mare Lamentorum\\'s second-half, and Labyrinthos had weak points within them (primarily the Loporrits), and Garlemald took a smidge to set-up, but otherwise the plot proceeded with characteristic aplomb. Though a touch heavy-handed, the expansion begins immediately to build upon the core theme that will run through it\\'s course.\\n\\nIs life meaningful?\\n\\nIn this regard; I found there to be pay off for years of playtime, acknowledgement of investiture, and a fitting conclusion to all that came prior.\\n\\nAlphinaud and Alisaie obtain their own subplot and grow just a little bit more. Urianger too has a strong plot.\\n\\nG\\'raha Tia and Estinien both have great moments as well with their own flavorful charms.\\n\\nThancred\\'s arc resolved in Shadowbringers, but the threat ahead does eventually reach home with him.\\n\\nAnd even Y\\'shtola, who is by far one of the least-developed of the Scions, claims some moments to her pile of treasures.\\n\\nKrile astoundingly has a stake in the plot once more, and Tataru shines in an unforeseen way.\\n\\nZenos will be polarizing, but I believe we\\'ve seen at the very least; a taste of what his writing led toward. Simple, but fun.\\n\\nAnd of the questions of Hydaelyn and Zodiark; well...\\n\\nIf you believe that the story has a clear-cut ending in which you embark to slay a God of Darkness, and then put down a tyrannical Goddess of Light...\\n\\nYou would be mistaken. It\\'s an easy assumption and many would presume to be the natural path.\\n\\nEndwalker endeavors to go beyond the anticipated and expected to provide something more succinct and more fulfilling.\\n\\nEvery encounter is akin to a Final Boss; and the stakes have never been higher. A hackneyed saying, true, but I believe FFXIV has reached an apex.\\n\\nFrom here on, the threats will need to, on some level, deescalate. Even the hinted at \\'Void Expansion\\', that looms in the distance; while grand in scope, shouldn\\'t surpass the grandiose endeavor we\\'ve just wrought forth.\\n\\nThat said; the feeling of an ending does not eclipse the future. A rather hamfisted bit of dialogue, albeit touching, does ensure that the future of FFXIV is without a doubt, endless and boundless. That between the remaining worlds, and the untold tales within the Source, we\\'ve only scratched the surface. Let alone things like meddling in history\\'s flow, or alternate timelines.\\n\\nAnd so to that end; I am excited in a new way.\\n\\nThe ending was tremendous, and in a few fashions, I feel it was shackled. Shackles it wore without shame, but bound by what it built.\\n\\nNow the game is free to tell a new story, a new plot, a new overarching grand tale that can head in any avenue it so wishes.\\n\\nThat said; the game\\'s age will undoubtedly arise. And at this, the most delicate of junctures, a transition will transpire.\\n\\n14 may be in it\\'s golden age, and time will tell if this expansion will usher in the next with applause and more players than before, or if we begin to see the the end of this MMO\\'s grand sprawling journey.\\n\\nBut what can be said, in the here and now...\\n\\nThe ride took many risks. And I believe for the majority, it will pay off.\\n\\nFor the road we\\'ve walked to get this far, was nothing but delightful. Worth it. And fulfilling nearly every step.… ExpandA perfect ending to a 10 year saga. Although server congestion is rough, SE had communicated with the players on what to expect and explained they were attempting to increase server capacity but due to the current climate this has not been an easy feat. Here’s to 10 more years of FFXIV.$15 a month, to watch the login screen count down from 3-5k (for 3-5 hours), is not the best use of anyone\\'s time, or money.Truly the greatest fantasy story ever told.The music is some of the greatest in visual media. The fights are some of the most tense I\\'ve ever experienced in a video game. I\\'m speechless.Endwalker is phenomenal and provides great closure to possibly the best story in any entertainment media in decades.Better story than most single player games. Best in the past two years for sure. Great multiplayer aspectsThis expansion manage to surpassed even Shadowbringer in many way. Don\\'t let the launch issue discourage you from trying out this masterpieceAlthough I am not through it completely, I can say that it is on par, if not better, than the masterpiece that is Shadowbringers.The game brings many things in the MMO ganre to a new level and that how it should be done.\\n\\n- We know questing in MMO is boring, every MMO player would agree on that one. The idea to place the entire story in dialogs, cinematics and few mini games is amazing. And this decision would not be good if they didn\\'t wrote one of the best stories ever. It was just a great finale for both the Zodiark/Hydaelyn saga and the first chapter.\\n\\n- New zones are absolutely stunning. At first it was quite strange that some of them are existing only in the main story and will not be lore friendly to go back there, but that gave them the freedom to do insane things with those zones. Totally stunning design.\\n\\n- Music is master piece. This the only MMO that I just can\\'t play with spotify instead of its original audio and even so, this expansion was above expetations (I still don\\'t like the trailer song, but everything else was stunning).\\n\\n- Dungeons solo quests and trials were designed amazing.It was pretty good introduction of all basic mechanics that will help to the new players in the future challanges. I love that they are a bit faster and more mechanics overlap on normal mode so it didn\\'t felt too easy, holding your hand content. And we already know that the next patches will unlock some great addition to this.… ExpandWonderful story and breathtaking soundtrack continue the trend of the game surpassing itself with every new expansion. Cannot recommend this enough.Absolutely breathtaking ending to a Saga started 10 years ago. It is mindblowing that such a story could outshine that of Shadowbringers. This expansion is truely epic, the best Final Fantasy story i have seen yet (and i have played almost every entry)… ExpandThis is absolutely the perfect end for a 10 years trip.The real vote of this game for me is 9.7The plethora of emotions is overwhelming. This is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. From the story to the score. A true classic of our times. Log-in queue issues not withstanding, SQEX got everything right.i just finished Endwalker. I’ve been playing this game since it’s first expansion and the only words i have for it is this: Once in a lifetime experience.Endwalker ist the highlight of the best MMO ever. The story does things to you that even story heavy single player gamer struggle to give to you. This is more than a game. Its an experience.Shadowbringers is a hard act to follow, but Endwalker makes it look effortless. A beautiful soul-affirming finale to what has become an incredible world that rivals the greatest in any medium. Whatever comes next, they stuck the landing, and the story is forever great. The sense of wonder, the characters you come to know like friends, and the soundtrack... oh, the soundtrack. All of it is best in class. If you like satisfying and emotional narratives, you will find no better here.This expansion is an unforgettable adventure, pushing the MMO narration to its limits.Probably the best story overall  I have had the pleasure to play in the past 10 years.Very solid ending to a great game, I truly hope there will still be more to come now the main story has been told.Despite issues with logins caused by the massive influx of new players (for good reason). Endwalker wraps up an otherwise astounding narrative tale between good and evil. The story not only keeps the player on the edge of their seat, but takes them on an unexpected emotional rollercoaster. If someone is patient enough to play through the drier base game and make it this far, they will find a narrative experience that has never been seen to this scale in a video game before. Truthfully a masterpiece.This expansion is FFXIV at it’s best. It has somehow surpassed the high expectations placed by Shadow Bringers for phenomenal story telling. Easiest 10/10, I’d score it higher if I could.Walk free, walk free, walk free, believe...walk free and believe that this game is mediocrity at it\\'s finest.\\n\\nIf you read the reviews and listen to your friends, they\\'ll tell you that Final Fantasy XIV and all of it\\'s expansions are the greater story ever told to humanity. They\\'ll have you believe it is some philosophical enlightenment that will change your life.\\n\\nWhat I found, especially with Endwalker as icing on the cake, is that it is nothing but a hodge podge of story elements ripped from every single Final Fantasy and thrown into one. It\\'s the most ridiculous, ludicrous, and fan-service filled story I have ever seen since Metal Gear Solid 4. It\\'s filled to the brim with padding, filler, and pacing issues because the FFXIV developers are so adamant to stay to their MMO formula they\\'ve created. They must, as they have to have story content to justify the existence of zones in the game because, well, that\\'s all they\\'ve got for those zones.\\n\\nExcept of course for the most boring fetch quests and events ever created for zones in a MMO. Just spawn enemies to AOE over and over. Creative, right? As someone from Guild Wars 2 that has some of the best map design and event design, this was a huge let down. What\\'s sad is, Bozja proves they can make more entertaining maps, yet they don\\'t. We are stuck with maps that are absolutely pointless once you\\'ve escaped their respective expansion. And I don\\'t even want to delve into the 3 aoe mobs - boss - 3 aoe mobs - boss - 3 aoe mobs - boss- fin dungeon design. The dungeon design has only gotten worse since ARR.\\n\\nThe protagonist (you) is a poorly done mannequin, the invincible, always at the right place and the right time, generic hero. Any failures and mistakes are done away with in a matter of minutes and shrugged off. You\\'re companions all fill their generic tropes, some more than others. A couple are developed alright, but the rest are severely underdeveloped, quite honestly, you\\'re often left wondering why they are there at all. Seriously, you\\'re so overpowered compared to your companions it\\'s like you\\'re baby sitting children most of the time who want to play superhero.\\n\\nLuckily for you, we\\'ve got one dimensional villains\\' every where in this game to compliment our lackluster cast. One that they love to bring back time and time again, to the point where he\\'s like a child lost in the candyshop. It\\'s like this villain isn\\'t even sure himself why he exists in the story anymore. But that wasn\\'t enough, another villain was pulled straight out of the dev teams closet out of no where with no build up at all, only to be easily dismantled by our perfect Hero.\\n\\nFFXIV and Endwalker have it all. We have traveling through dimensions, space travel, planet/moon hopping, cloning, time travel, visiting the underworld/death planes, soul swapping, reincarnation, etc.\\n\\nWhere will the WoL go to next? Probably Yoshida\\'s ass, because the fanbase loves sniffing his farts almost as bad others sniff Kojima\\'s.… ExpandZodiark gets done dirty, also that bird character.. Jesus, what an unsatisfactory conclusion to the arc. Pacing was awful til you get to elpis. And out of nowhere you get this stupid boring bird character who\\'s the big bad this whole time. Zero build up, the character has every convenience they could give the character like being able to manipulate this new never before discussed or hinted at energy dynamis. That just so happens to be more plentiful in the universe that aether, what a coincidence. Guess the writers heart wasn\\'t really in it this expac ggs better luck next time.… ExpandThe feelings this story creates, the culmination of a gaming experience I started on the ps3 beta way back in 2013, it\\'s indescribable. Truly. I was worried they wouldn\\'t surpass Shadowbringers, but now I worry no mainline FF title will EVER be able to top this. XIV has officially stolen my top spot from IX, and typing that is such an odd feeling. I finished MSQ on day 3 or so of early access and I can\\'t stop thinking about it still. All I can do is put the soundtrack on repeat and cry.A waste of time and the community has become more and more toxic I play from the beginning I had fun in the past I liked all the dlc the raid especially that of Nier but if you are slow and you have difficulty with your job, be careful because he has a lot of cyberbullying, the story is good but there is too much useless moment just to lengthen the story, the side quests are empty, avoided if you have no friends because in ff14 if you are alone you will be harassed.Atm addon is unplayable. The best queue simulator. With monthly sub!!! Well done, Square Enix! The addon is simply unplayable due to the 3-8 hour queues (sorry, but I only have 1 hour to play in the evening). Best way to waste money... 3 weeks from start and addon still unplayable. And all compensation we got - 7 free days of sub.The new jobs are fantastic.\\n\\nThe story has major pacing issues and from a story perspective does not land very well. As a 1.0 player this is probably from a story standpoint the most disappointing expansion of the lot. And it hurts to say because I love FFXIV but sorry this story just...isn\\'t good.Terrible story, this whole game is a total mess, there\\'s nearly no gameplay at all and it\\'s just one of the worst MMO ever made.Amazing culmination of an epic story. The way everything is neatly tied up us incredible.Would give 11/10 if I had.My refuge of good writing in 2021. Art, music, history.What a end for a Safa doing justice everything you have had so farSTORYTELLING MASTERPIECE! I have played all Final Fantasy Titles from 1 to 15 (including most spinoffs). And while this is an MMO, this is first and foremost a FINAL FANTASY, which are well known for their amazing stories. I have been here since the disaster that 1.0 was. And I dont think anyone ever imagined this turnaround, which will be marked in gaming history as one of the most important stories of adversity and success.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and play this croning jewel of gaming. The story, music, immersion, character development are stellar. No other MMO has ever achieved this level of fulfillment in many aspects. Shadowbringers had set the bar so high, that I had serious doubts that they would be able to surpass that, even more so then they announce that this was the end of the \"SAGA\".  I did had doubts. But not only did they deliver, they surpassed all my expectations in so many levels. Endwalker delivers and links with you on so many levels and reaches an emotional height like no other. You cannot call yourself a JRPG fan and miss out on this game. Even if you just play fit for the story and be over with, even then it is worth it. From the battles, dungeon design, to the AMAZING cutscenes. This is just simple STELLAR!Endwalker is a victory lap for both FFXIV and the FF series in general - a joyous affirmation of everything that has made this series great down through the years, whether it be diverse casts of lovable characters, interesting locales to explore, fun classes to play, or spectacular boss battles to overcome. It has its missteps here and there - small issues with quest pacing, dungeon design, and inconsistent voice acting to name but a few - but I found myself so swept up in the epic events unfolding before me that I just didn\\'t care. I\\'m waiting with bated breath for the raids to drop and I can\\'t wait to see where the dev team take the story as we begin a new saga in 6.1!I have literally spent 4 days with goosepumps. What an incredible piece of art and what an amazing journey. It took me back to my RPG era and I remembered why I loved FF so much. Because lets be clear, not only this is the best expansion of the game, it is also one of the best FF JRPG ever made as a stand alone. It is that incredible. The music, the zones, the story (which even if it has a few pacing issues managed to grab me to never let me go), the dungeons, the trials, the solo duties, what an adventure!! I have not felt like this after a game for a very very long time!as expected the Endwalker is another excellent addition to Final Fantasy 14 expansions, and continue to solidify FF14 as the best comeback of a video game in history, it\\'s still surprise me how Square Enix manage to make each expansion better than the previous one,\\nif you already playing the game and still can\\'t decide whether to get Endwalker or not i\\'d advice to go ahead and get it, this is expansion is a must have IMOA masterpiece, everything is tied together with an insane amount of breathtaking OST’s Endwalker or i’d rather say FFXIV in a whole is a must play.Amazing expansion once again a visual treat fantastic music a top class narrative that shoots up the ranks as one of the greatest jrpgs ever made its great to see developers make a piece of art as well as a video gameAn expansion fueled with love from its praised developers & community.\\nAfter 8 long years, a story that filled most of us with unending emotions finally comes to an end with a future that we can all look forward to.\\nIts music, locations, storytelling, battle system improvements & new additional features that I will to you to enjoy have truly made this expansion the best ever released joining the likes of Shadowbringers in all its glory.\\n\\nThough a negative at this time with all MMO\\'s on release will be the long queue times due to its game popurlarity you cannot fault this expansion for the journey you receive in return, as it triumphs over a queue time that shall pass and be improved in the future.\\n\\nA simple reminder for all newcomers once you get past ARR and enjoy the fruits of HW beyond..\\nYou will truly be immersed in what an MMO is suppose to be.\\n\\nWhat a wonderful time to be alive!Absolutely amazing. Best expansion. Best sr Final Fantasy experienced and Final Fantasy game. It solidified the masterpiece that shb started.Very good expansion!The dev is passionate, understanding and caring!Its better than shadowbringersYes! The queue times are bad but thats a sign of healthy gameAn incredible Expansion. The story is great and a more than worthy successor to Shadowbringers. The new zones and cities look amazing. The music is beautiful. And the two new jobs are very well made. FFXIV has delievered 10/10Deeply emotional story.\\nEvery music track kicks in at the right moment.\\nI can only hope that someday the developers will be able to completely untie it from online, so that the game will forever remain in history and everyone can enjoy it.I had start FF14 journey last year. Amazing RPG experience. Love the story, character, music, gameplay, and everything in the game... Thank You FF14 Team! Now I have start  looking forward for 7.0 . Please keep it up!! FF14 TeamIt surpassed the past expansion, Shadowbringers, and improved in many ways, it left me with an open mouth and a lot of tears, but in the end, only the feeling of hope remained.\\n\\nYou are not Alone, then Forge Ahead!After shadowbringers, endwalker expectations were high, but yet they managed to deliver something very satisfactory, story is great and with a very good ending, biggest downside is that it is indeed very dragged in some points and obviously made to increase time, but that\\'s a general problem with FFXIV, fights and designs are very appealing, dungeons are very pretty but quite disappointing challenge-wise after the 1st one. Extreme trials so far are not the most challenging compared to what we had but still fun.Absolutely masterful writing bringing an 8 year story to an emotional and powerful conclusion. Incredible characters, well thought story beats, amazing gameplay... everything and more to make it the absolute best Final Fantasy as a whole has ever had to offer.It would not be an exaggeration to say it changed the way I view my life and goals... In a good way. It\\'s a master work from start to finish.The final fantasy to final all fantasies. This can be considered the ultimate Final Fantasy, all the staples are well represented there with tasteful reference to many previous games and mythology. The characterization of the classes/jobs here is the definite version for most of it, each class/job manage to be so unique and still retain the flavor that made them known through the franchise. And the writing.... The latest expansion finishes a saga that started in 2010 and its a history that manages well to juxtapose realism with cosmic fantasy. When its telling more humane stories it succeeds in depicting politics, war, economy and revolution in a very complex, realistic and nuance manner. Nothing is black and white and the whole representation is very coherent. On the other hand, the fantastic aspects are as over the top as you would expect from a Final Fantasy full of non-sense jargon and crazy concepts while still being cohesive and compelling.Best MMORPG ever made and also one of the best stories ever told. The way this game tells a story is unbelievable, to the point you forget you\\'re playing an MMO. Amazing music as well. Masayoshi Soken should be recognized as the best video game music creator of our time. Thank you to everyone who gave us this masterpiece of a game.Best expansion ever made on a game i though shadobringer will be the best and i was worng.\\n\\nSoken music 100/10We did not think Shadowbringers could be outdone, we were completely wrong. From the story, to combat, to raid design, to the social aspect, it\\'s just exceptional. While the entirety of the game might have a few flaws, this is as close to perfection as MMO games have gotten so far.I had never played MMOs until this game. I always like single player games only and I can tell you this is the best game I have played in 25 years, and I have played a lot.Overall, I found endwalker to be pretty fun, but it didn’t quite hit the mark for me. I kind of gave up on some endgame content sadly so I don’t have the full perspective to give, but my experience came down to how the story and arc went along with some of the dungeons and raids. The story I found to be interesting but not great. For me it lacked the fundamental solo adventurer arc that I originally loved about FFXIV and rpgs. I am aware this is an mmo and is not meant to feel that way for some, but the other installments leading up to ew had me exploring more on my own while meeting new and interesting characters. This experience felt like I was always with the scions which I already knew and have seen enough of them quite frankly. I wanted this experience to feel a little newer and was hoping to get out of being with familiar characters constantly. The buildup I found to be extremely slow and painstaking at times, the arc itself felt too philosophical at times. The whole rabbit people I found to be annoying and the villains kind of fell apart for me as interesting. The que times were horrendous.  I loved the arc going back into the past into Elpis and hanging out with Emet-Selch, the ending was good, and the dungeons and raids were great as usual. Overall though, I felt fatigued by the end of it and the thought of grinding all of my jobs and characters up again. Perhaps a lot enjoy that aspect, but by the end of Endwalker it felt like more of the same stuff which may feel the same with any game that’s been going on for this long. I feel like a basic mmo final fantasy stan would love this, but someone who wanted something new and fun added to keep me playing, it felt a little dry to anything higher than an 8.The mini \"review\" will feature story only and is spoiler-free.\\nA worthwhile ending for the greatest story any MMORPG has featured so far. Though it does not quite hold up onto Shadowbringers, it is overall a fantastic expansion. The second best I\\'d argue. Ending a narrative, especially one that has been told for over a decade, is not easy. In fact, oftentimes endings tend to be a bit disappointing. Not to lean on the anchoring bias too much but just think of recent endings of (former) high profile shows or games. Examples like Game of Thrones and LOST come to mind. Anyway, my point essentially is just that it is >relatively< easy to start writing a story but finishing it adequately can be difficult. That is why I\\'m pleased this wasn\\'t the case for FFXIV. In terms of lengths it is also the longest of any expansion so far. So there is plenty in regards of quality and quantity. Whether this is a 9 or 9,5 or a 10 ultimately doesn\\'t matter to me. It\\'s subjective anyway. I\\'m just glad the Hydaelin and Zodiark arc got a conclusion it deserved. Thank you for reading.Final Fantasy XIV has been and interesting development. Since its failed 1.0 launch to the launch of Endwalker. Every single expansion has been building from the previous ones. And this is what allows to have one of the greatest story line not only of any MMORPG, but of any RPG in the last few decades. It is a well deserve conclusion to the many years of world building and storytelling. If you are a sucker for story driven games look no further than FFXIV.Endwalker builds on the excellence that has been established in previous expansions, particularly Shadowbringers. The music is great. The story is compelling and moving. The dungeons and duties are fantastic. This is a very worthy successor, and I look forward to what comes next.Incredible closure to the story, they take their time to explain everything and leave no or few questions to the players.Great ending to a wonderful story. So excited to see where we go from here!Playing, all the fantasy finals for me are great, how many some live in the beggars in the beggapass, sonystas only plays goodThanks for the Russian language in the game.Great price too.Everything is good at turning.Cool ... ExpandFinished EW after playing through the whole game with 2 friends from A to Z. Managed to somehow finish just 2 years after our arrival in Eorzea. My best gaming experience, by far, and this expansion is in my opinion the perfect end to a grandiose adventure like this.Forge ahead, Warriors of Light!absolutely fantastic ! What a wonderful story and music overall . The dungeons are extremely adventurous and the storyline made me cry like a baby ! insane gameThe new jobs are great, actual good QoL updates, love the new male Viera race, great voice acting and cut scene work, the music was amazing and Soken has yet again outdone himself, and lastly the story has been fantastic and a nice wrap up of the saga. Of course there are a few negatives such as, small pacing issues, and a few annoying escort/follow quest. The were queues are rough during high peak times, but of course will die down in the weeks to come, and it was not something we weren\\'t warned about before. These negatives are small and insignificant to the positives this expansion gave. 10/10This game is a culmination of one of the greatest stories ever told in the \"MMO\" medium. I can\\'t express how much attention to detail these developers took to make sure the product is set to their high statndards. Regardless of the \"server congestion\" issues which were expressed MONTHS prior. The game itself its in my opinion a MASTERPIECE!\\n\\nOverall:\\nStory - 10/10\\nEnvironment - 10/10\\nGraphics - 10/10\\nCombat - 10/10 (for tab target based games)\\nMSQ Pace - 10/10 (slower if you do sidequest)\\nContent - 10/10\\nEmotions - 10/10 (how much the expansion makes you \"feel\")\\n\\nI found ZERO bugs\\nI had ZERO issues with server stability\\nI have about 20hrs of QUEUE experience\\n\\nAnd with all that being said ; to the ff14 team THANK YOU SO MUCH for an AMAZING game! it\\'s been one hell of a journey - looking forward to the next ARC!I don’t know how they keep doing it, but the MSQ in each expansion gets better and better! I thought ShB was the greatest Final Fantasy story yet, and then I played Endwalker. This expansion wraps FFXIV up as one of, if not the greatest video game stories ever told. Without going into any major sopilers, the ending is probably one of the best I’ve seen in a game and the new classes are fun and fresh. The only complaint I have in the expansion are the new accompanying quests, but it doesn’t take away from the experience at all in my opinion.Best expansion in the game, if it wasn\\'t a DLC for a game I would honestly give it the GOTY.Perfect ending, never thought it was going to end!!! Surprising that, for an expansion called \"End\"walker.I really love this game, new class are really fun, new summoner is good and the story is great, but ,for now is lack of endgame content. But in the future they will add more content so..ffxiv is always a great gameprobably the best Expansion any mmo ever had with an amazing story, one of the best soundtracks in video game history.\\nBut due to its massive success there is quite a large queue when entering the game.I was tempted to take off a few points due to the login issues. But then I realized that, 6 months to a year from now nobody will remember these login issues, but everyone will remember how amazing that story was.\\n\\nThere are few single-player RPGs with a story that even comes close to what EndWalker has to offer. This is truly the pinnacle of what MMORPGs can achieve, and living proof that, yes, MMORPGs can have captivating story.\\n\\nArt direction is also top notch, music is incredible and elevates the whole experience. Really can\\'t find anything negative to say here, and I did think about it for a while.\\n\\nFor new players it may appear daunting to jump in a big MMORPG like that, but trust me - it\\'s more than worth it.This Game continues to deliver even after so many years. It\\'s no easy feat to keep pushing out good quality content and these devs do it all the time. GGsBest MMORPG, clearly .... pleasant gamplay, nice story and loaded with content, a lot of map and challenges that are worth seeing.\\nThe huge positive point for me is the musical compositions, I never appreciate so much the music of a game, in short ... It is worth 10/10 without being a fan of the seriesIt’s an absolute masterpiece. It’s an absolute masterpiece. It’s an absolute masterpiece.MASTERPIECE this game is so good the music,  the settings, the characters, the plots everything done so wonderfully i cried so many times, to be honest with you I don\\'t know how will they ever top ENDWALKER.Spoilers will be noted when about to be mentioned. I started playing ARR a couple of years ago and thought it was pretty good, specially compared to 13 and 15 which were half baked games.   It wasn’t incredible like FF X or XII but it was way better than any FF since then.  I had heard that HW was were it really got really good so this year bored with everything that was coming out decided to give it a go.  From mid January to mid May I played every day until I finished the last available ShB patch. I was BLOWN AWAY.  Not only did it restore my faith in the franchise it also made me a fan of MMO’s.  Obviously Endwalker has been my most anticipated game of the year and now that I finished I can say that it didn’t disappoint.   Up until right before the last battle it was becoming my favorite expansion yet, but that final boss was the base on balls on a perfect game in the last out of the last inning.  It was followed by a hit and then the final out.  It was still a shutout but no loner the best.   Spoilers ahead…..I still don’t understand why Yoshida decided he wanted to keep Zenos in the game after Stormblood.  I think he worked pretty well as the villain for that story but in the Hydelain-Zodiark arc, I could never find a reason why he kept him.   Yes, Fandaniel was weird but when we actually learn everything about him, it makes a lot of sense to have him.  But Zenos? Why?  I see some of the meta reason, the ultimate battle for the heck of it, for no reason at all.  He may represent a reflection of the MMO player who fights for no reason and skips the story, but it still felt as something that put a break to the emotional rollercoaster that it was up to that point.  Now, other than that, man what a great expansion.  Elpis is amazing, the moment you see Emet Selch, woah, I had my mouth open almost clapping like a stupid seal.   Dungeons are an extension of the ones in Shadowbringers.  While they don’t feel new, they are still great and offer an amazing atmosphere.   Music is absolutely amazing and the mini boss and boss battle theme might be my favorites yet.   New zones are also incredible and the design of the overall package is almost flawless. I still think this is the second or third beat expansion. Both HW and ShB hit me deeper.   Both are more contained plot lines that felt more solid and were super well paced.    Where this game beats those two is in the conversations about nothing with the scions.  The moments like when they take a short break to eat dinner.  Also, the Garlamand zone was a-ma-zing.   Omg. How great was that?   I was never a huge fan of the Empire story line, felt it was a recycled story trope that was not entirely something I wanted to see again, but the way it was treated here went into a place I never expected. High praise. Overall Endwalker is an amazing expansion that leaves me wanting more. It’s a beautiful conclusion to the 10 year saga and I can’t wait to see what’s next.  9.5 out of 10.0… ExpandThey did a wonderful job wrapping up the current story line! I cannot wait to see what is coming next!For me the best expansion of all of the FFXIV\\nEW, SHB, HSW, SB, Arr.This is my order that I liked most, judging only the .0.\\nThe new characters 9/10\\ncharacters returning 10/10\\n10/10 trials\\nHistory 10/10\\nI took 11 days to play from 80 to 90 and read the story calmly and I can only say that it was wonderfulI do not believe that there could be a better ending to such, truly, fantastic journey.Probably the best game I have ever played, truly a masterpiece.

The game looks gorgeous. My biggest take is the absence of HUD, so you get to immerse yourself in the environment as the wind is used to guide you to your next location. My biggest gripe with most open-world games is having to spend half the time looking at the mini-map and this game solves it beautifully.\\n\\nAlso, there is no level gating, where you can\\'t fight an enemy because they are 30 levels above you. The combat is fluid and really satisfying (playing on hard). The loading times in the game are only a few seconds, which is surprising given it is running on HDD and such old hardware.\\n\\nThe photo mode is rich with features. The customization and charms are fun. I feel this is the game that everyone wanted an Assassin\\'s Creed in Japan to be. Overall, I have really enjoyed the hours I have put into this game. Congrats to Sucker Punch on this great game.After fully beating the game and getting every trophy  I can say that this game is absolutely amazing .. graphics wise the game is beautiful .. the game play you actually feel like a samurai .. compared to ac it\\'s better .. the sword feels like you are slicing through dudes the enemies are not damage sponges . You are actually carrying a sword not a wooden stick where you are slapping the guy haha .. so far I been playing on hard they kill you in a few hits .. you gotta time your blocks and Perry attacks.. armor is customizable .. and skins and colors you find everything in game !! Not dlc which I think is amazing . The photo mode is beautiful.. I ran in to a lot of side quest And side quest are their own mini Stories!!! Not fetch quest !!!. I don\\'t see anything locked behind a paywalls .. Honestly I think it is the best samurai game on the market and most authentic ..combat is probably the best I seen in a new release .. The game got different features an authentic Kurosawa mode which gives it that old black and white samurai movie feeling even the audio changes full Japanese voice over,.. similar games always felt too button mashy .. ghost offers  a change you barely see they actually made a sword feel like a sword .. you are not beating an enemy with a wooden stick .. .. enemies differ from different fighting systems and subtypes of the same style . You’ll encounter two people with a shield but one may fight a bit different then the other .. different stances work on differ opponents .. timing and pacing your self is important .. Ghost of Tsushima offers an experience that is worth looking in to must buy .. truly this is an amazing gameAbsolutely loving this game! Nice and fresh take on some open world systems that really works. It\\'s everything that I was hoping it would be.Very ambitious game from Sucker punch the developers of Infamous and sly games ,Ghost of Tsushima takes off slow through the story but it gets interesting and better each time as you continue the story , the world is so beautiful filled with a lot of activities to enjoy , the wind system really makes the game special and refreshing , there’s no need to open the map every time , highly recommend the gameThe game is purely amazing. Fun combat, a huge map worth exploring, side missions and main missions. The graphics are beautiful, and the wind tracking mechanism is an amazing touch. I could go more into detail but I dont think I need to. You got to play this game.The style of the era of the Times drama that is full of the horse war ghosts is very stimulating that the surge in the adrenaline of the unique beauty students who died in the samurai of the samurai made me very excited about the beautiful scenery.Come!Great game, amazing combat, decent story, amazing open world. Sucker punch’s finest game yetSucker Punch won my heart with the original infamous and since then all their games keep improving on the previous one. They took a long time to release another ps4 titles but the wait was worth it. The story is amazing and it reminds me of classic japanese cinema, the music is very immersive and memorable, the graphics are mind blowing and photo mode is like a dream come true. the combat is very impressive, the only tiny flaw is when enemies are hit by arrows it looks silly. Sadly ultra left progressive reviewers bombed this game with 60s and 70s when that is far from the rating it deserves all because it doesn\\'t have thar ultra diverse marginalized cast they always beg for. People need to get off their high horse of virtue signaling and allow people to enjoy games for what they are ENTERTAINMENT NOT POLITICAL STATEMENTS.The level Design os amazing. History and deathblows looks like classical Japan moviesSamurai sword go weee. Very good. Fun time you can pet a fox the game is very goodMy favourite game so far it\\'s fantastic i was waiting for a samurai game like this thank you sucker punchOne of the best games I have ever played. Combat is fluid and feel amazing, huge open world full of things to find and do.Amazing Gameplay and Artstyle. Best exploration and open world since breath of the wild. Combat is deep and rewarding when mastered on hard mode.Awesome game.... Really a masterpiece.... Stunning and brave. 10/10..........Finished the game a couple of hours ago, I’ve been thinking about it since then, and I really did not have a good time with it. The world is beautiful, no doubt about that...but everything else really didn’t do anything for me. I won’t go into story because...spoilers.Buys this game over TLOU2 you won\\'t regret it.  This how do make a game for everyone to enjoy.Used to trust user reviews more than critic reviews for games. But wtf happened here? This is a stale open-world game with solid graphics but a lame storyline, boring mechanics, and a lack of any originality. How is this the one of the highest scored games of all time for y\\'all? What a disappointment.everything is good on this game but cutseeing could be better . Fighting and stealth system it worked well. generally it the best game i played in this yearsI am a huge fan of Japan,Samurais etc but no this is not what i was expecting.\\n-The first thing that i didn\\'t like is the graphics (THE GRAPHICS NOT THE ARTISTIC DESIGN) yea i stop from time to time to take photos and stuff because the world is very beautiful but no many textures are blurry,view distance is so low, the night is ugly and the reflections are all downgraded compared to the first gameplay reveal we saw.\\n-For the gameplay part i hated the fact that they didn\\'t have a lock on system for the enemies.\\nThe stealth is so silly mostly because of the bad AI and the animation  system on the enemies.\\n-Very easy even on hard\\n-Bad lip sync especially on japanese, even on english.\\n-The wind is supposed to guide you but if you open the map you can still guide ur self with it.\\n-Plot wise is meh\\n-The Cinematics remind me of Mafia 3, low budget, you know static cameras with ppl talking without interaction...\\n\\nBut i liked the atmosphere,the exploration,the soundtrack and the art directionThe best in this year. … ExpandHands down the most beautiful open world I\\'ve had the pleasure to play in. The combat system is deep and rewarding. Interesting and non monotonous side activities with so much to do. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this one, and with the sub par ps exclusives at the moment *cough cough tlou2. This one was a breath of fresh air.Can\\'t get this game when its release, so (luckily) found a used from someone because of his PS4 toast during a thunderstorm. (Guys, Please don\\'t play during a thunderstorm, don\\'t be an idiot, it\\'s just a game). The game is a bit glitchy at some parts but not that bad. Wanted to remove bad aftertaste of TLOU2. But hey, on the bright side, I use TLOU2 as an expensive coaster for my \"I hate Naughtydog\" mug.Pretty generic open world game, not recommending this to anyone who likes good games.Good history , beautiful graphics and a lot of things to do in game , I’m loving it.Put your character to the center of screen, not somewhere in the corner. How can anyone even play this?Boring assassin\\'s creed clone. World has nothing interesting in it. Yeah it\\'s hard pass.How would i describe it? How about boring, uninspired and overrated, yeah that\\'s about it.Whatever happened with originality? It\\'s so similar to AC games, but then again it\\'s worse than  AC games. Worse because it\\'s just not that unique. You are dude with sword and you are in Japan: the Game.Very inferior version of what Ubisoft has been doing with open worlds, and a very poor interpretation of Japanese culture and history. Gameplay wise it is very shallow compared with games like the soulsborne series.Inferior version of basically any Assassin\\'s Creed. Graphics are cool, but what else? There\\'s nothing interesting to do in this open world. People who try to say it\\'s better than AC games seem to forget that big part of AC games is parkour.Looks quite nice for the most part, but that\\'s about it. The Japanese paint job that was slapped on the same old open world mechanics can\\'t stop the game from feeling incredibly generic after a couple of hours. Combat is too easy, camera is clunky, too. Probably would have felt better if it came out a couple of years ago, now it\\'s just a bunch of mechanics that have been done better by other games.Honestly surprised the user sore is so high for this game. I thought it was just ok. Ghost of Tsushima offers some pretty landscapes, but they are lifeless. The movement is relatively clunky, and it really could have benefitted from some refinement there. It\\'s a game where there are elements of ninja-like stealth, but the movement is extremely one dimensional. You hide in the grass, stay out of sight, and that\\'s about it in terms of stealth. They do a great job with the map, but moving throughout it is also very one dimensional.\\n\\nI won\\'t go on with a long review, but I was unfortunately pretty disappointed by this game. It\\'s also pretty ridiculous that so many people are using TLOU2 to influence their review of this game. They are completely different games that happened to come out within a month of each other. Too many biased reviews here, I\\'d pay attention to the critic score for this one.Get out of here with all these 10\\'s!!This game is not a 10 at all. Its an extremely average game. When I first started out playing I did see its potential that unfortunately got boring fast. I\\'m just glad I purchased it on disc because I ended up trading it in.Feel free to give it a go but much better games are available than this!Unplayable horrible aim movement. So sluggish and time consuming that every single time you want to look at any direction, which is several hundreds of thousands to a million times on one play though, it takes full second till anything starts really moving. It has so ridiculously slow and bad acceleration system that takes eternity and any sane people needs to wait turning to the edge of insanity. What kind of d##b a## s##t is that. Whoever develooer decided to do or accept that should ged fired immediately. Also there is no options to fix it. On fastest settings it just is very slow. At slowest, its like do you want to wait retirement or insanity come first. Samurai and ninjagames should be superfast, not slower than a snail. No options to change buttons neither.Good graphics get 2 points. Other than that, absomute failure.Bought it with 60 dollars and gotta say i don\\'t like it at all. Very disappointing. Story is very generic, but my main issue is that character is not in center of screen. So playing it really makes my head hurt. So just before you buy it make sure you are able to play game where character is literally in the corner of screen. I have never seen it done like that. Little bit off center? That\\'s fine, but this one is just bad.I tried it for 3 hours and i didn\\'t like it really. Story kept dragging and nothing really interesting to do in this open world. Meh.Graphics - 9/10, Story - 6.7/10, Open World - 3/10, Characters - 3/10, How fun is it? 3/10First: The 83 average score is pretty accurate. The high user score is most likely a result of internet culture and review bombing (#tlou2).Now the game itself:Story is mediocre. Jin is one hell of a boring protagonist.Side quests are uninteresting and the characters are kinda empty. Nothing catchy here. The game itself feels grindy way to often. I\\'m over 25 hours in and had not a single \"wow\" moment. Worth playing... But there\\'s a whole lot better games. Nearly every other Ps4 exclusive. DON\\'T BE FOOLED BY THE USER SCORE. REVIEW BOMBING.The visuals are good. The fighting is good.Another problem is the difficulty. The game is too easy in my opinion. But that\\'s not really the point.This can\\'t match with rpg standards of the Witcher 3 or something. Sucker Punch did a good job but the last of us 2 is better in every aspect if you want to compare it.One of the best games I\\'ve played in a while the combat is amazing and the graphics are absolutely gorgeous.Unbelievable game and the writing and story is actually awesome.. this is how a Revenge story is supposed to be told unlike TLOU2... as AVGN would say, \"WHAT WERE THEY THINNNKIN\" !! @naughtydog.Sucker Punch did an amazing job on the game, the graphics and gameplay are really good. The combat is really good and it is fun doing standoffs, one of the best games of 2020.This game could be amazing but many nonesense dialogues, weak combat mechanics and a terrible camera make it look like a rushed product. To be honest you could overlook the first issues but the camera is really, really bad, worse than demon souls just to be clear  :/ i really hope they do something about.9,2 User Score? For real? I feel incredibly shocked by gaming culture these days. TLOU 2 which Set a new bar for storytelling in video games was review bombed and this repetitive game that does everything the exact same way and 100% caters to a non inventive open world trend with full of open world cliches and lackluster level design gets a 9,2? This could easily be an assassins creed game it’s not less inventive in fact Ubisoft create more detailed and prettier open worlds and Users would downvote the hell out of it. Unbelievable truly....Very, very disappointed. Game looks great but it has loads of filler and the story and writing is poor imo. Combat is very easy and gets old quickly. Camera angle is very clunky. Game feels very dated, if it came out 5 years ago I think it would have been received much better. Disappointed.Looks amazing sometimes and so bad others , sword fighting is cool , but so many problems , it’s just not polishedOne of the best games that I\\'ve ever played. Loads of options on how to approach combat, the world feels alive and is amazing to look at. The story also has immense thematic value to it. A must-play it you own a PS4.Great game! Beautiful gameplay with awesome music and a direction \"honorable\" as Kurosawa\\'s movies. A game to be enjoyed more than once.Game or VCL, fuck your mother, add a great director\\'s cut, nice gameGame or VCL, fuck your mother, add a great director\\'s cut, nice gameGreat game.  Immersive atmosphere, beautiful scenery, three-dimensional side characters.  Ubisoft needs to take notes on how to balance the size of an open world map with the amount/variety of collectibles.\\n\\nThe most satisfying aspect of the game is the RPG aspects actually paying off over time.  I feel like most RPGs nowadays are incredibly lazy.  Rather than evolving combat or introducing new enemy types to maintain challenging gameplay while your character levels up, most games that I\\'ve played utilize level-scaling.  What\\'s the point of leveling up if the rest of the world levels up with you?  Why is the same bad guy I fought when I was level 1, equally challenging to fight when I\\'m level 200 (looking at you AC)?!  In Ghost of Tsushima, just as bandits start to get trivial, you get to act II where new enemies are introduced (no spoilers), then as you progress and the act II enemies are starting to be a piece of cake... you get to act III and enemies are incredibly well armored and organized in groups that have a wide array of weaponry that can cause any fight to go south quick if you make a single mistake.  But at any time late in the game, if you stumble upon bandits (the main enemies from act I), you\\'ll see how much more powerful you have become via your playthrough as you slice through them.  It\\'s incredibly satisfying.Man i already finished it 3 times and its just such a masterpiece, stunning world and atmosphere, lots of things to do in the big and interesting open world, super fun gameplay and fights and i didnt think the story was so good until i finished it.... some time later i played the legends mode and had lots of fun with friends too10/10 would recommend to everybody… ExpandFuck the mother, the game is good, thank you Sucker Punch for letting me play this game thank you very muchAmazing game but the Japanese Audio is not going will with lipstick ………………………..… ExpandFuck the mother, the game is good, thank you Sucker Punch for letting me play this game thank you very muchBest game I’ve played ever, combat is fluid, the story is intriguing and with the new lock-on ability, gear load outs, it’s the best combat fluidity in a game I’ve experienced, thank you sucker punchBeautiful game with gameplay that matches.  I play xbox as my main however it\\'s games like this that always keeps me buying Playstation as wellFuck the mother, the game is good, thank you Sucker Punch for letting me play this game thank you very much: 3333Fuck the mother, the game is good, thank you Sucker Punch for letting me play this game thank you very muchFuck the mother, the game is good, thank you Sucker Punch for letting me play this game thank you very muchA great ending to the PS4 era. An exclusive game that shines among 2020 releases.Best game i ever played since the witcher 3 Story lines so good and historicThe best game of last few years.Made with great love to gamers.Dont believe to bad reviews....Its probably made with fake accounts of Neil F*rtbox...Just look what games were rated by those accounts and you will understand.\\n10 foxes out of 10Very atmospheric game and how good it is that this heresy is not like ... ExpandFor me this game is absolutely beautiful. The way Sucker Punch has brought the game to life is just breathtaking. In my opinion this game is what Assassin\\'s Creed should strive to be. On the day it was released I accidentally played for over 24 hours straight it is so easy to just get pulled in and lost from just exploring the world around you to liberating your fellow countrymen the real world just seemed to melt away. Now upgrading equipment takes a lot of resources so that means farming resources but unlike that of Assassin\\'s Creed which made grinding very dull this game makes enjoyable it does not feel like a grind since there are so many places to visit and see and alot of bases to clear there is also a certain weapon charm that practically doubles most resources collected which helps alot. In all of my total time spent playing the game which as of right now is about 30+ hours I haven\\'t even made it to act 2 yet but  I haven\\'t been doing all main missions I don\\'t fast travel or focus on specific things I just have fun playing the game. I haven\\'t been pulled into a game like this in years I don\\'t get bored I look forward to getting on and playing it has so much to offer and the difficulty is brilliant and balanced. I highly recommend this game to everyone and I stress do not rush through it take your time with the game and just take in the development of your characters emotional choices and how his choices really conflict him explore the world around you and have fun.My god this game is better than I expected. Really deserves to be considered too for the GOTY. ❤️We will call an interactive cin, but with the open world and without interactiveSucker Punch has truly outdone themselves and set the bar higher for open world games and the way they approach exploration. Through the use of the guided wind mechanic, I never felt lost and at the same time never felt like the game was holding my hand to my next destination. I normally rush through the main story and then replay a second time, taking my time to see everything. However, this is the first open world game that I truly became lost in. I explored every inch of the map and enjoyed the deep \"side\" quests which serve to flesh out the world and characters.The combat is fast and fluid. Coming from Nioh and Sekiro, I still found the game to be incredibly challenging at times, while never having the **** one hit kills that Nioh can have. The combat evolved constantly and 50 hours in, I still don\\'t feel even slightly bored. I hope they will add challenge rooms or something similar to the Arkham Games. The combat is a mix of the old Assassins Creed games, a bit of Arkham games, Shadow of War and a bit of Spiderman PS4 in the way that you are allowed and even encouraged to experiment in your approach. No two fights will ever feel the same.You already know the graphics are stunning, the game is lengthy and deep. The map is the most diverse I have ever seen in a game. If you love revenge stories, you will definitely be satisfied and I eventually grew to feel as though I was Jin Sakai, the Ghost.Go out and get this game. You will not be dissapointed.Sucker Punch surprised everyone with this work of art at the end of the generation.Amazing story, very fun gameplay and beautiful graphics.It was a game that ended the generation with a golden key!Fuck the mother, the game is good, thank you Sucker Punch for letting me play this game thank you very muchAbout 8 hrs into the game. In short, one of the most polished open worlds games released to date. Graphics, gameplay mechanics are top notch. Story so far tight and engaging. Looking forward to many more hours as a samurai :)I was waiting for ghost of Tsushima forever, much longer than LoUP2. I am not over exaggerating when I say this game the best blade combat in any game I ever played. Every battle is thoroughly tactical and enjoyable. And the enemies are NOT damage sponge dummies ,  the enemies get harder by fighting better, your blade is just as deadly in hard mode as it is in easy mode, but in hard mode you have to learn how to use your tactics and head in battle to overcome the enemy. Gorgeous game. Will play it over and over . 10/10. Thank you sucker Punch!!!It’s an absolute masterpiece, I mean is there anything else to say, 10/10, if you’re mainly into sword fighting, this game will never bore uThis game is everything I wanted and more. Stunning art design, fantastic music score, simple yet complex fighting structures. The culture, history and beautiful open world environment is enough to buy this game and make it an instant classic. Add quality storytelling and hours of gameplay, will make this a highlight for this generation of console gaming.Sorry but this game is not for me, i seen the trailer, and the gameplay, and it turns out boring and somewhat downgrade, almost the same downgrade like ubisoft, the story is just ordinary, there\\'s not hing that really made me interested on this, gameplay is super crap, graphics is just ok, i don\\'t know if this a rip off, but if you ask me, i do not like it, and i do not recommend it.Artificious difficulty, bad level design, bad IA, unbalanced, combat system Is initially exciting but It get more and more boring since few hours from the beginning. The only good thing here Is graphic and some parts of the Story. The thing Is this game Is broken and boring.An essential of the PS4 catalog.Spectacular graphics, very interesting history, superb sound and a very addictive gameplay.The fighting is very epic and gives the possibility of being faithful to the samurai code or being a cruel murderer in the shadows.All a success. The progression and skills system is the most rewarding. You don\\'t miss one of the great video games of the year.Worthy contestant to GotyOn reading some of the reviews I saw mention of an Assassins Creed set in this era of Japans history. Its still not appeared and now, I don\\'t care,. This is a game with excellent gameplay, great combat, solid acting and script. I have one gripe, its TOO BEAUTIFUL I can\\'t use fast travel or even gallop on the horse its just too beautiful to missSome say that the perfect game doesn’t exist. Those people haven’t played GoT yet. This game is PERFECT. Soundtrack, graphics, story, immersion, it have everything. I thought I was tired of open world games, turns out I was tired of playing the same open world game in a different skin. In this game the hours fly, you don’t play it thinking about how long until you finish it, you play it and then it betrays you, ending. Easily game of the year for me and it had HEAVY competition.Wow . It\\'s been a very long game that the story takes me to an another world. Just wow.\\nCombat mechanics + characters + story + music + depth of  dialogues + graphics everything is great  in ps5.  Only enemy A.I is lack of intelligence, they don\\'t hear you meanwhile you take out their friends 3-4 meters away.   Gears+weapons+ skills etc. Everything is a masterpiece.Must play! Wonderful world, full of life, strong characters. Few problems with enemy A.I. and camera angles. Bought it used, half-price and turned out to be an AAA title, far better than expected.Ghost of Tsushima manages to feel distinct, charming and artful despite following a familiar open world structure and existing in a market full of games of its ilk. Its recreation of Tsushima island is gorgeous and cohesive in its 13th century Japanese identity - scattered throughout the island are tons of fox dens, torii gates and hot springs. The character of the game just leads to a really immersive experience.\\n\\nThe game\\'s story sees its protagonist, Jin Sakai, become the titular Ghost as he employs ever more dishonourable tactics to defeat the enemy and repel the Mongol invasion. It\\'s a fun story to watch unfold, and it culminates in a genuinely emotional final duel that tops things off brilliantly.\\n\\nGhost of Tsushima certainly delivers on the gameplay front too - the combat is fluid and stylish, and the different sword stances afford it some depth. The bows feel good to use and there are enough other projectiles and abilities to keep combat fresh.\\n\\nIt must be said that the graphics and art direction in this game are excellent. The use of colour in particular leads to some lush, tranquil scenery, the vibrancy of which makes this recreation of Tsushima island a treat for the eyes. If you\\'re anything like me, you\\'ll be spending a lot of time in photo mode.\\n\\nAnother thing I\\'d like to praise is the guiding wind feature - swiping up on the touchpad causes the wind to blow around you in the direction of your current objective. This removes the need for a mini-map which helps to maintain the minimalist HUD, and I just think it\\'s a smart little feature.\\n\\nGhost of Tsushima has a healthy amount of content, but it\\'s not without some bloat. Some of the side quests are unexciting, and even though the open world busywork has a charm to it, it is still repetitious by nature.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great title. It sticks to a tried-and-tested formula, but it does it so well that it doesn\\'t matter; it\\'s not a complete breath of fresh air, but it\\'s a fitting swan song for the PS4.Aesthetics and historical loyalty create an immersion never seen in an AAA gameGhost of Tsushima is easily one of the best games ever made. It might suffer some open world loops but it is fresh and unique. The story telling is miles above comparable games, the visuals are one of the best if not the best of this console generation and the combat system feels amazing.\\n\\nI ve played Ghost on my PS4 Pro with SSD and I want to say \"thanks!\" for amazing visuals, incredible loading times, no bluescreens, no slowdowns and with 1.04 next to none bugs. The sound design is amazing in combat, scenery and surround composing. I literally made more ingame screenshots in Ghost then with all my other PS4 games I ve ever played combined.\\n\\nThis game will take you on an amazing journey and even with only going for the main storyline you will have incredible fun, deep story telling and complex character development on a course of 30 to 55 hrs depending on your play style.\\n\\nI do not want to go into detail, you have to explore this game for yourself.This game has a story to tell and it does a successful job in doing that. From the characters you meet to the scenery in the world, it\\'s theme is consistent and it succeeds in being the game that was shown to you in the previews.I went into this game expecting nothing, I liked the idea at first but then when I played it I found out how masterful it is. I wasn’t expecting this game to be my surprise gaming addiction but now I can’t put the controller down, I must play this game everyday. Now for the real review, the story and the gameplay are incredible, you get to explore but you can choose your path, this truly is a game of choices and branching paths and story lines. The mechanics like I said incredible and customizable, the gameplay is extremely fluid. If you love stealth or being a ninja and assassin you will love this game.I rarely take the time to rate games, but this one deserves your attention. If you own a PlayStation, go do yourself a favor and buy this game. Phenomenal art, gameplay, and a powerful story all come together to make what might be my game of the year. I found myself deeply invested into the characters, and the outcomes of their stories, feeling regret when I had to make dishonorable decisions to save people. This really is a masterpiece, and I’m excited to see what Sucker Punch makes next.One of the best games I have ever played. The narrative and characters are impeccable! Love the lore of a samurai who has to choose between doing the correct thing or living (and dying) by his code. Just hope nobody beats Jin to death with a golf club in the sequel :/Ghost of Tsushima is an excellent new game in the historical fiction genre. The story tells an easy-to-follow journey about a samurai who must break his code of honor in a desperate attempt to stay alive and save as many Japanese as he can. Exploration and side quests both offer a variety of possible rewards to enhance the experience. The melee combat requires some precise timing, but it is less demanding than Sekiro. At some point, every player will experience some trouble with the camera and the lack of a lock-on feature. Patience and better positioning can alleviate the camera issues, though.\\nEnjoy the spacious land and its set pieces. Ghost of Tsushima looks gorgeous, and the vibrant colors are even better when you are the one playing the game.\\nBeing guided by the wind is a brilliant idea to reduce the amount of clutter on the screen.\\nThe game has accessibility options and full voice acting in English and Japanese.\\nI\\'m glad the developers did not focus too much on hyper-realism. Nothing takes too long. The healing, looting, loading, traveling, and upgrading are all quick and designed to be convenient which lets the player get back to the story and action without tedium.\\nAddendum: The side-quest cutscenes are awkward because the characters stand almost completely still while talking. Their stiff body language makes those so small conversations uninteresting to watch. But the game is still 9/10 because the action is fun and that\\'s what matters the most.When the game came out it was such a refreshing escape from the real world.  The locations were beautiful, the combat was innovative with its different stances paired with enemies that it kept the game from getting too stale.  The story was engaging and the duels were feats of cinematic inspired excellence.  By the end some of the quests and combat became a little monotonous and exploration had much of the same to offer, but this is a small complaint because what it had to offer was often times very enjoyable.this game is right up there with witcher 3, and rd2. combat is a bit easy and could be better but overall amazing graphics and the story kept be interested the whole wayPretty flowers, guiding wind and dark atmosphere that captures the setting of feudal Japan and the Samurai perfectly, making it one of the most gorgeous looking games to date, what could go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it\\'s just a very beautiful wallpaper, no depth, no risks, nothing never-seen-before... same old generic Open World \"Go there, kill enemies, liberate territory\". To be frank, there\\'s a big variety of tools when it comes to combat and the feeling of the Katana is EXCELLENT, smooth animations and many abilities to unlock, it\\'s a very enjoyable experience despite the repetitive and shallow mission design which is by far the biggest problem of the game. As for the story, it\\'s simple and predictable with some amazing scenes, and there are some very few likable characters but most of them are forgettable because it feels like, everyone can be Jin Sakai, even though he\\'s a cool character, he doesn\\'t feel like he\\'s his OWN character, he\\'s just a random Samurai, and this goes for every other character in the entire game. In the end, I was left a tiny bit disappointed, because honestly, I couldn\\'t get attached to this game, and I don\\'t understand why, but I will give it a higher score than what it deserves because I really had fun playing it, some scenes were absolutely fantastic and the music was great and that made the whole game better for me.The game environment is extremely beautiful. It has an interesting fighting style. Also the story of the game and its happening is great. Has worked well in open world style. It really is one of the best games.Let me start by saying no game is perfect. With that, I\\'m giving ghost of tsushima a 10 because it exceeded my expectations and executes well, everything it set out to achieve. Combat is first and foremost exactly what I wanted and more, to feel like a one man army legendary samurai. Next, the soundtrack alone makes the game praiseworthy, as it sets the tone for each peaceful to intense swordclashing moment with prime accuracy. My highest praise for the game, however, stands with the artistry and environment of the island. The journey to every objective is heaped with breathtaking scenes, beautifully chosen colors, and the most realistically replicated sky that could be imagined. In addition, they used the environment as the guiding feature for the player, the UI is so clean, and at times, nonexistent.  The world bends towards your destinations and woodland critters emerge to lead you to side secrets and collectibles a very refreshing design choice.This is complimented by an excellent photo mode packed with features to add to your captures. My only real complaint for the game is that the writing is overall stiff, and, Jin could have been more interesting in this regard.In addition to the great graphics, this game has a sense of the diligence of the developers in the smallest detail.\\n\\nSo far, the main contender for the title \"Game of the Year\".Very beautiful game, the developers have tried to squeeze all the juice out of the PS4. The combat system is good, it\\'s a shame that there is no dismemberment.Definitely the best game of 2020 , every thing is perfect, the story, graphics, and the most important the gameplay is legendary, well done Sucker PunchMan i am going to miss this game, really enjoyed it, great story , side missions, graphics and man the photo mode is amazing, GOTY !!Easily Goty this year, maybe Cyberpunk will top it. Ghost of Tsushima is a great game and has no flaws whatsoever. Story, gameplay and graphics. 10/10.I was pretty tired of open world...i must admit that i started this game with not much hype about it. I even stopped after 1-2 hours. Then i took my time and damn i was blown away. I want to explore everything i got hooked to the game badly to the point that i always want to play it and discover its world. Good f job !!!',\n",
       " 'Playing thoses games for the first time and i am absolutely amaze by their quality. Ty to nier automata i found out about platinum..not to mention Hideki Kamiya and Shinji Mikami are also part of theses projects. Please Metacritic stop this troll spamming 0 score he create account non stop to diminish the ranking. ..gamelegend 67, gamelegend 97, gamelegendal and so on...please block the spams and trolls this game is amazing.I wish to play Bayonetta 2 as well on my ps4 soon...cus it’s not fair if we play Bayonetta 1 on all platform and then miss it sequel..but after 10 years It is still one of the best game of all time I played in my lifeClassic game, my favorite. But if it is sold again in the future, I hope to see it remade, have a new feeling, or remove bugs. Otherwise please don\\'t sell it again and again.And I hope that platinumgames to make Bayonetta 4/vanquish 2 on multiple platforms.  I don\\'t like platform war.Great bundle of games, I experienced Vanquish for first time and liked it more than Bayonetta. Graphics are little bit outdated but they\\'re ok, gameplay is very fun. Vanquish looks little better for me. Not very long games but if you go to harder difficulties and high score chasing you\\'ll get many more hours.BAYONETTA & VANQUISH unpacks existentialist philosophy through its binarism of light and dark.one of the best games, yeah it\\'s a remaster of the old one with better graphics and frame rate, the camera is still the same, they fixed it in bayonetta 2, you will get used to it.great games, but only bayonetta is worth it, one of the best female main characters around.Both of games are beautiful. I like this gameplay. They are most replayable games.Bayonetta is my most replayed game of all time. Specifically because of how perfect the combat and mechanics were from the beginning. Vanquish looks so much better than it did 10 years ago (on console) and the action/fighting/shooter genre has not been done this perfect since. The steelbook is sexy, affordable, and a must have for all action game fans. Platinum games are easily some of the most replayable games out there. I give it a perfect score because nothing ever takes me out of the experience. I’m constantly filled with adrenaline. I’m constantly thinking about how I can go about each battle better and learning from every mistake and death. These games are also perfect for picking it up and just playing for an hour OR picking it up and playing til the end. Every playthrough feels fresh and you find out better ways of overcoming each encounter with each playthrough. 10/10 must-playGreat.Unfortunately this generation has no hack\\'slasses at the level of Bayonetta.Awful graphics, awful controls, awful camera and bad theme. This is a pretty mediocre release in every way. Graphics are like welcome to five years ago. Were they blindfolded when making the camera? Main character is boring. Hopefully this is the last game in the seriesGraphics at all beautiful was not the maximum of the compreherenzia, there is to be changed.bayonetta is still an amazing game and it holds up great. Vanquish is a really fantastic shooter i really enjoyed not much to say about it. After coming off of TLOU2 it was a fantastic fast pace frantic shooter that was experimental. I love boosting across battlefields to take out enemies and race to save you allies. It short but the experience is totally worth it. This is a great combo pack packaging a great game with a ps3 hidden gem. the graphics are outdated but it doesnt hinder the enjoyment i had with sam and burns as they race to stop a crazy russian leader from destroying the world. Its simple but it has fun interactions and very fun gameplay. This collection is a total must get for anyone who enjoys bayonetta and wants a bonus with it.This review is for Bayonetta only.\\n\\nBayonetta shows its age quite badly here as a ten year-old game.\\n\\nFirstly, the \\'improvements\\' made for PS4 are marginal. At times the game appears to have improved FPS but at other times it\\'s very choppy and has noticeable screen-tearing. Like many remasters before it, I am very sceptical about what, if anything, is actually improved here.\\n\\nThe camera must also be one of the most aged aspects of the game. Despite imitating predecessors such as DMC, the camera is often slow and I found I had to constantly adjust it to get my enemies on-screen. At other times the camera would be at an awkward angle after leaving a cut-scene. These are little irritants that mount up to mar my enjoyment.\\n\\nThe gameplay is an odd element of the game. It\\'s very visibly influenced by DMC to the extent that it looks and feels very similar. What\\'s different is that there is an emphasis on dodging that is more reminiscent of Dark Souls. The problem is that gameplay can get very chaotic and messy with multiple enemies on screen, making it quite impractical to dodge as precisely as the game would like you to.\\n\\nAnother aspect of the game betraying its age are the QTEs. There\\'s a reason why they are almost extinct now; they are an irritant and don\\'t add to the game. Given that this is a remaster, they could have removed these completely for a smoother experience, as the QTEs in this game demand a high level of precision.\\n\\nSpeaking of precision, this game can\\'t seem to decide if it wants to be a hack n slash or a more methodical game like Dark Souls. I found it much more satisfying to turn down the difficulty and choose the DMC approach. The overall style and mechanics of the game played too similar to DMC for my liking to be played like DS, although I don\\'t like DS.\\n\\nIt\\'s not unusual for games to feature scantily-clad females, and Bayonetta is one of the few times I have taken exception to this, as it seems the game relies upon the sexualised nature of the protagonist a bit too much, distracting from the flaws in the game.\\n\\nThe story in the game got barely any attention from me. The sarcastic and non-chalant attitude of the protagonist feels too well-treaded in the modern landscape of gaming. This is also where the over-sexualised aspect actually detracts from the game also, as every cut-scene seems to involve some view of her derriere and she seems to lack the ability to walk normally. The feminist view might see this sexual liberation, but to me it comes across as perversion as the game was likely made by an androcentric studio.\\n\\nOverall, this game is clearly a relic of the previous generation. It\\'s one of those older games that I played without experiencing the pang of nostalgia. Instead I felt a lot of cringe about what I was oblivious to back in the day and how high standards have become. It\\'s hard to recommend this even if you missed it the first time around. DMC V was slightly disappointing but I\\'d still recommend it over this.Both incredible games, got me remembering really good old times. Great mechanics and music in both games. They are part of the \"classics\" you should play if you haven\\'t yet.There is no complete Russian localization.No voice acting!',\n",
       " \"Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Aniversary Bundle brings back Platinum's hit games to the current generation of consoles. Both games are High paced, adrenaline-fueled, non-stop intensity. Bayonetta is the story of two conflicting Witch tribes and the constant struggle between Heaven and Hell. You play as Bayonetta, a witch with guns hooked to her heels and endless combination moves. You awaken after 20 years asleep at the bottom of a lake, without all of your memories. You spend the game piecing together the past and using her insane arsenal of enemy weapons, and her magical hair, to destroy anything in your path from the smallest enemies to massive bosses.  Vanquish is a slightly different game, taking us from the following wide-view camera to a Third-Person over the shoulder cover-based shooter. You play as Sam Gideon, a Badass with a capital B. The country is being threatened by the Russians, with San Francisco destroyed, and New York in their crosshairs. With a wild collection of firearms at your disposal and an augmented battle suit, you slide and blast your way past hundreds of enemies, ranging from soldiers to huge Bosses. The gameplay for both of these titles has been pushed to 60fps and the constant action is creamy smooth. The cutscenes still feel a bit dated, but the intense gameplay more than makes up for these. For those who missed these titles over the last 10 years, here's your chance to enjoy two of the most intense action games made in the last decade.This is Very Good Remaster it does what its supposed to do. The Games play well and the 4K 60 fps look very nice.\",\n",
       " 'I won’t mind admitting that I was very jealous when NieR Automata released on the PS4 because it is a game that is right up my alley, and I was very tempted to buy a PS4 just for that game. There was a part of me though that hoped it would eventually release on the Xbox One and as you can imagine when I first learnt that it was making its way to the Xbox One I was very excited to say the least, and I’m pleased to say that it was well worth the wait. Everything about this game oozes class and charm and to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be a massive understatement. I heard many good things about the game’s story and now I can see why because it’s breathtakingly brilliant from start to finish and the gameplay that accompanies the fantastic story is also flawless. The reason the gameplay is so flawless is because every little different mechanic and aspect adds a unique side to the game. You’ll be pleased to know then that the combat plays a big part in making the gameplay so addictive. Everything runs so smooth when you’re in combat and that means defeating the enemies you face always remains satisfying throughout your time with the game. This is a very good thing because in terms of content the game has a quite a lot for you to be getting on with. The content also doesn’t get boring either because there is variety dotted throughout the game’s fantastic world. In fact the content is that good that my only gripe with the game is that the fetch quests can be a little tedious from time to time, but this is only a small gripe and you can easily look past this. If you’re a fan of big and magnificent boss battles then you will no doubt be pleased with what NieR Automata has to offer. Each boss in the game actually felt like they mattered and the clever design of them meant that fighting them was not only rewarding but it was also very exciting as well. I have to also give a special mention to the presentation side of the game as well because it does enhance the gameplay quite a lot. I know everybody isn’t a fan of NieR’s style when it comes to the visual department, but for me I think it’s perfect and when both the visuals and sound design combine together you end up having even more of an immersive experience.  At the end of the day even though NieR Automata came out last year on the PS4 I still think it deserves a special mention in regards to game of the year this year because quite frankly it’s fantastic. It’s not very often when a game gets everything right but it does here and in the end I can’t recommend this game to you enough.Square enix did it yet again. Nier: Automata is the single player hack and slash RPG every xbox gamer wanted to come to our platform, and it did.\\n\\nIn a time where aliens invade earth with machine lieforms, the human race hangs by a thread on orbiting \"bunkers\". There are so many things that this games does perfectly that tons of other games attempted. Lets start with the constant POV changes. One minute you\\'re in the standard 3rd person, next you\\'re playing as a 2D sidescroller, usually finished with a top down sequence. The game blends the POV so well in a way that comes off as refreshing in the gaming world.\\n\\nThe combat is fluid and satisfying. Every blow to an enemy feels significant and wonderful to do. Nier: Automata in a way reminds me of a faster paced Bloodborne. If you aren\\'t evading enemy attacks you could instantly die to a combo in higher difficulties. (You\\'ll die instantly from one hit on the hardest difficulty regardless). The boss battles always have your adrenaline running which is something I haven\\'t personally felt since Cuphead.\\n\\nStory wise, the game is pretty straightforward and makes you question your morals and the cause you\\'re fighting for around halfway through the game. Otherwise, the game is spectacular in every respective way. My only complaint is that there are a few questionable texture pop in times here and there. Nonetheless, Nier: Automata is the perfect game every Xbox player should own.The game is fun, but to play over and over for the alternate endings is sort of a drag. If you like anime, definitely buy this game.Nier: Automata kept me hooked throughout its duration, but on reflection I kept playing waiting for something that never came. Although it touches on a number of philosophical themes and has a decent story, it\\'s not as deep and it\\'s nowhere near as mind-blowing as people make it out to be. There is an interesting narrative here, and there are emotional moments, but for some reason I was expecting more, perhaps because of the near universal praise it gets.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I loved the soundtrack - it\\'s amazing, and fits the game perfectly. It really adds to the atmosphere which is already great due to the design of the abandoned city and other parts of the deserted Earth.\\n\\nThe gameplay is pretty varied and changes between a few styles that are all quite fun. The hack and slash did wear a bit thin for me but there\\'s enough customisation for you to keep it feeling fresh if you put the effort in.\\n\\nOverall, it is a beautiful game, and after getting the 5 main endings I can say it\\'s worth playing. It\\'s a creative and different title. I did like Nier in the end, but I just wish it had story beats I could have truly been surprised by and been in awe of.Before I start, I would like to preface this by saying: a) I haven\\'t played ANY game of this universe, and haven\\'t heard or seen ANY spoilers to this game, and b) I started playing this game only knowing that Nier Automata is \"one of the best game to have ever been created\".\\n\\nNier Automata is a great game, yes, but it is far from all-time classics.\\n\\nThe main characters are memorable, distinguishable, and most of them serve their purpose, but they\\'ll hardly be used as a measuring stick to other main characters in future games.\\n\\nThe plot is decent, I guess, and I\\'ve got to give the writers the credit, as sometimes when you just KNOW they are going take a bunny out of the hat, they manage to take a tiger instead. Yet when you know SOMETHING is going to happen, something really happens.\\n\\nSpeaking of the plot itself, for me, the last third of the game left some sour taste in my mouth, not because of the outcome, but rather the feeling of missed masterplan opportunity. If you\\'ve finished the game already, you should understand me. It\\'s is an example when a fan-theory actually makes more sense and has less plot-holes than what has actually happened according to the original source. Route C is just so kabuki-ish and too far-fetched.\\n\\nThe open world is beautiful and picturesque, however graphics sometimes looks a bit dated.\\n\\nThe gaming process itself is okay, however the navigation and camera are all over the place. These are two weakest points of the game, as for me.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t say that the gaming process is too repetitive and grindy. I mean, sometimes it is, but it serves its purpose and somewhat rewarding. So, no major complains here.\\n\\nThe strongest point of the game is, without a shadow of a doubt, its score. One of the most beautiful gaming OST out there.\\n\\nAll in all, Nier Automata is no ordinary RPGSlasher to kill some time, sooner or later you\\'ll find yourself emotionally invested into the depth if its drama, however I can\\'t guarantee that you\\'ll end up gaining as much as you\\'d like to.\\n\\nSolid 8 for me, arguably 8.5.The top negative review was literally an accident. What else is there to say? This is easily the best game I\\'ve ever played and almost certainly the best of all-time, and I imagine it will stay that way for a very long while. The game\\'s sole issue is that the amount of things on screen makes it hard to see what\\'s going on sometimes. Other than that, the story, characters, gameplay, music, graphics, performance (on console), is all perfect. If you haven\\'t played NieR: Automata, what is truly wrong with you?best part of the game was the credits and i mean that in the nicest way possibleThis game is simply perfect, I love the history and the characters and the visual and the control. Everything is perfect.Nier: Automata is a trip like none another, from its gameplay that catches you from the second 1, to its atmosphere and its soundtrack that will make you bristle the skin, its deep story that does not stop doubting and thinking both a concept and concept of a concept andexistence.Undoubtedly to finish it, but God, it was worth every damn second, Yoko Taro is a damn madman, but she is a madman who knows how to make good stories and good games.This game is a masterpiece in literally every way. The combat never gets old and flows incredibly well, the soundtrack is one of the best I’ve ever heard in the games industry, and the story is extremely thought provoking and engaging. You come to care about the characters a lot as the story progresses, and none of them follow typical anime tropes, it’s even difficult to actually call this game a jrpg with how different it is from the rest. For me the world never felt empty, and it was for a reason as large scale vistas were displayed in front of you. The only area I believe can be criticized is the lack of gameplay variety in side quests, however the side quests still add to the world, whether it be new weapons or adding to the lore of the world. This game definitely makes it into the top 10 games I’ve ever played, and even if you have the slightest inclination to buy and play it, absolutely do it because you will not be disappointed!Amazing, masterpiece, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard.This and Bloodborne are game of the generation. Cannot wait for NieR 3. a good 40 hours of content to explore.Amazing game, graphics are first class on the Xbox one X (Digital Foundry have found this version to be the best console version). Great gameplay and story,  10/10.Incredible game with a fabulous story. For the first time in a game the New Game + actually made sense.THE PEOPLE RATING THIS GAME AT 0 HAVE NOT EVEN BEATEN THE FIRST LEVEL.\\nThey are upset that the game doesn\\'t immediately start as a JRPG like Final Fantasy. That starts on the 2nd level. This game is criminally underplayed and absolutely deserves more recognition than it gets. The game had a great story, amazing hack and slash gameplay,Amazing graphics,amazing game\\n\\nA good hack n slash game i highly recommend itAbsolutely amazing one of the best games ever made.With one of the best stories I have even seen in entertainment.This game is absolutely stunning; from the visuals to the story. A game that makes you question many things and with various different endings. I would highly recommend this game for those who want to fill the void that a game like Dark souls has left in you. Do not search up ending e I recommend  that you get the earn the the ending l, it is enough to make full grown man cry.… ExpandA lot of potentials and a lot of lost/wasted potentials too. On my 1st run, I really couldn\\'t lay my controller down, I was really fascinated by the story and the characters. I\\'m at my 2nd run as I\\'m wiring this review, there just slight differences, it just feels like pain and struggle, the motivation and fascination fall almost down to zero! My good advice: Just leave it by 1 run and watch the other endings on YouTube. Side quests are boring and not really worth it. I hope that the next Nier game has some improvements.This is the best game I have ever played. Not because it has the best graphics, or it has the most open world - it doesn\\'t. But it certainly has the best story. It\\'s affecting, hugely affecting, and innovative beyond belief. If you want a standard RPG then this either won\\'t be for you, or it will deliver something so far above that that you it will blow your mind and change the way you view games forever. I guess my only concern is that I oversell it here and make my review seem too good to be true. Maybe. But for me it\\'s a stone-cold 10.I just cannot accept a game without a save point for an hour into the game, forcing you to first replay the idiotic badly written initial story, and then play defensively (button mashing fire auto-locked on enemies) to preserve your lives until the first save point. Most people trying this through game pass will never get past this point.\\nThe camera view angle changes are gimmicky and force you to some atrocious top down battles. Xbox One X is underused, with bad textures, bad colour palette (black character against brown enemies on brown flour in the top down is almost impossible to see).\\nA for originality, D for everything else.As someone with both an Xbox One and a PS4, I\\'m excited that Xbox One users get to experience this game.  I do have to say, PS4 is killing it this generation when it comes to great exclusives and so I rarely use my Xbox One which I think is unfair in a way.  Hopefully the next generation of consoles have close to equally great exclusives to reward buyers of each console.No save until first boss killed and can\\'t skip many intros. Need wait and pass easy parts again. Annoying.Are you f**king kidding me??? I die to the first boss within a matter of seconds because I don\\'t immediately figure out how to dodge his attacks, and now I\\'m back in the f**king MAIN MENU and have to START THE WHOLE GAME OVER AGAIN??! Not even being able to skip the goddamn cutscenes?! Is this supposed to be some kind of dumb meta-joke?\\n\\nYour game can be as good as it wants, if you don\\'t have the basic common sense to put a checkpoint before a boss-fight in the BABY TUTORIAL MISSION where the player is just figuring out how to play your f**king game (which is also way more difficult than it needs to be, since your game is dogs**t at explaining stuff), I\\'m not interested in playing it. I don\\'t have infinite time to spare on nonsense like this. F**k this s**t. Glad I didn\\'t spend money on this but just downloaded it off Game Pass.Well, it\\'s not the same developer as for the first to deny ... And yet it is as boring, as painful, as heavy as the first: it must be said that this sequel is a carbon copy of the first but in a SF universe instead of the supermarket fantasy of the previous one ... and here with a story taken from a surprise kinder by the way. Or a Carambar joke ... An investigation is underway.\\n\\nAs in all the games of \"platinum\" anyway, it goes quickly and it is very agitated as if we are witnessing an uninterrupted epilepsy crisis in each fight ... that it is confused, especially since the View can change radically and actually use all possible or imaginable views: maybe original but messy, far too messy!\\n\\nAnd what a vacuum anyway apart from these waves of enemies, then these stupid bosses ... Nothing but the first I must say that he healed me in advance of all the others ... is not the difficulty, it is the heaviness and the arduousness, the already seen, the cheesy, the beautiful thing ... the infinite doglit in short.\\n\\nAnd as usual, there is always a concern with the principle of safeguard, only at specific points, activating a shit precisely, then you can finally save in a restricted zone which will not bring you anyway that Dirty precise place and precisely, just to piss you off. Because it works like that in Japanese games.\\n\\nThat said, there are other typically Japanese but less unpleasant tics: the 60 Im/s for example or the sexy heroine whose panties can be mixed. In all relaxation. We will note this army of warrior robots that we would like to inspect more closely ... Between perversity and bad taste characterized, we sail here in troubled waters, waters that the Otacul people know well!\\n\\nAnyway, if the game is rather pretty (and very fluid of what I have supported) it remains technically very weak and really empty. It is written clearly with the ass and as tense and boring as it can be: I even believe that it has surpassed themselves in this regard ...Totaly stitched up with this games high marks. It\\'s basicaly a game from the 1980\\'s with better graphics. First you can only save a game at end of each level but I only completed the first level which was very long and tedious. You are greeted with an old skool shoot em up that the graphics actually look like it was made in the 1980\\'s, unlike games of the 80\\'s you have no lives and have to start over if you die ( although it\\'s not exactly difficult ) which is painful as you then have to wait for it to load again ( not sure why it takes so long ) after that it puts you in a kind of table top view of your character fighting robots still not hard and after that a type of 2d platformer which is still not hard ( give me me super mario bros on the snes all day long over this please ) anyway inbetween the tedious combat of just holding down the trigger and pointing you then get plenty of running through sections with nothing happening ( yawn fest ). The only good thing about this game is the main character you play which is actually drawn nice. The game is technically 3d but nearly always plays as 2D apart from the boss fight which again was a tedius long drawn out affair. Sorry to anyone who likes this game but to me it was incredibly boring and rivals Fallout 76 for how bad it is. You would probably be better off watching a film than playing this, it\\'s not really a gameI thought i was getting an RPG? I didnt, i got a ridiculously difficult twin-stick shooter. Dodging doesn\\'t even work, the enemies still hit you. Typical JRPG crap. Waste of money.This may be one of the worst games I have played in quite a while, it\\'s an utterly tragic affair. It tries really hard to blend rpg, platforming and shmup elements into some cohesive story rich experience, which is comendable...but it simply stumbles and smashes it\\'s face at every step.\\n\\nThe \"platforming\" sections are marred by awful camera function and instill a massive sense of pointlessness. The exploration is a waste of time in the empty, boring world, which can take an age to traverse at times. The general combat is tedious and repetitive, with next to no satisfying payoff at any point. Shmup patterns and controls feel amateuring at best, leaving anyone with any experience in the genre bored to tears or laughing out of despair.\\n\\nThe only redeeming factor is the soundtrack, which is just wonderful. It\\'s just a sad fate for the composer, that their talent and hard work is forver attached to this sad excuse for a game. How anyone is giving this 5-6/10 is confusing enough, seeing the 10\\'s on display is just outright hilarious. Quite telling that they often never say what is actually good about it and just call it a masterpiece.\\n\\nAvoid like the plague, or just watch a longplay and play anything else. You\\'ll have served your time better in the long run.Overhyped game.\\nMusic and B2 are great.\\nEverything else is average or low scale.\\nStory just OK.The most philosophical ever. Amazing story, amazing gameplay and make u think, ur existence again and again. Make sure to play all 5 main endingsStory = 7\\nGameplay = 7\\nGraphics = 5\\nSounds = 6\\nPleasure = 6\\nAtmosphere = 7\\nDuration = 6The game takes you through an exciting adventure with multiple points of view and an extra part once you finish the main storyline. The characters are well developed and the empathy that you develop towards them is well justified.\\nThe game lacks a better development of the antagonist and the boss\\'s fights.\\n\\nMain characters are beautifully designed.\\nYou will finish the game full of different feelings.\\n\\n*Here in Madly Geek we try always to finish the games 100%, and this one wasn\\'t an exception, and it was pretty enjoyable to do this and plus pass through the secret and special ending that is a gift from it\\'s creator, that goes along pretty well with the game\\'s philosophy.I made an account, just so i could rant about how great this game is. I played this on my pc a while back but never put hours into it, since my PC is kinda a potato and so performance wasn\\'t great. The game stop reps didn\\'t even know this was on Xbox and was utterly lost trying to help me find a digital code. It\\'s a real shame this game doesn\\'t get the praise it deserves.\\n\\nI\\'m playing on the One X and man, is it a pretty game. Sure some of the textures could use a bit more pop to them, but honest i was happy with the 4k and HDR. The game play was super fun and was smooth. No performance issues and the only real bad thing i could say is the cut scenes was a bit lower res and just didn\\'t have the fidelity that the rest of the game did.\\n\\nNow you can\\'t review this game without mentioning the 2 best features of this game. The music and the story. The combat is fun and all, but dear lord the soundtrack is probably the best i\\'ve ever heard. it really fits the atmosphere and the whole post apocalypse vibe to the planet. It\\'s very anime feeling with the music but it fits the feel so well.\\n\\nNow the story is going to get the highest praise i can give. Now some may not agree but i genuinely could not wait to do more missions and learn more. To see the story unfold and to see the twists and the differen\\'t routes. The character development between 2b and 9s was superb. Honestly even the machines with their different quirks was such endearing characters and i was  happy with the endings i have seen so far.\\n\\nThe combat to me feels like DMC so if that aint your thing, then you may find it hit or miss. It did get a tad annoying to constantly hold the pods shoot button but the combos and different abilities gave some refreshing options to different fights.\\n\\nThe camera will switch between 2d and 3d views and feels very stylish and really makes it feel more cinematic, but oddly kinda still helped keep the immersion. Same with some of the UI. It felt very robotic which is fitting for the setting.\\n\\nNow there is 26 different endings. You level up for what seems like forever, so there is a metric ton of replay ability. You definitely want to at least get the main endings in the main routes. A, B and C. Some was kinda nice to stumble upon and a few felt kinda funny, but really it just gives you more to do.\\n\\nHonestly all things said and done, if you are reading this, you probably heard about this game. I honestly dont know why you wouldn\\'t play it. Sure i wish the story was longer, the world was more open and a few other things but this is a MASTER PIECE. The music and story is instant classic. The gameplay is fun, and i mean really isn\\'t that why you play games?\\n\\nDont listen to the others. This game can be challenging on higher difficulties, its save and camera features are different from most games, but trust me when i say if you play this game the right way you shouldn\\'t have many issues. I think i died only once the entire play through on normal and experienced zero serious bugs or save related issues. So just take the 30-40 hours and beat the main routes and enjoy this game. It\\'s definitely one of a kind.\\n\\nJust a few tips, first buy plenty of healing items. save often incase you trigger an ending, always use your pod, and dont repair your dress after you self destruct, unless you dont like \"the view\" XDTHE PEOPLE RATING THIS GAME AT 0 HAVE NOT EVEN BEATEN THE FIRST LEVEL.They are upset that the game doesn\\'t immediately start as a JRPG like Final Fantasy. That starts on the 2nd level. This game is criminally underplayed and absolutely deserves more recognition than it gets. The game had a great story, amazing hack and slash gameplay, and some bullet hell moments that will give you a good challenge no matter how experienced or inexperienced you are. Give this game a try.Perfect.A game that mixes everything in a beautiful way and with a little antws qualityOne of the best games I have ever played. The graphics, music and the story are breathtaking. This is not a game this is an experience.  I\\'ve been playing it on standard Xbox One and it is available on XPass. The game runs at 60 fps for most of the time with minor dips.NIER: Automata features an absurdly serene soundtrack, an invoking gamepay that mixes several generos in a chin -fall story, where both the main and secondary ones keep us for hours in a row.An amazing game.It may be monotonous by having to finish it 4 times to see the good end.But the game system and history, something I have seen in yearsPreviously I had played NieR:Automata on PS4, I would have given that a 9.8. on XBOX One X though it puts it at that perfect 10.\\n\\nThe differences are a much more improved framerate and resolution, visuals don\\'t really improve too much but theres a little more smoothing around edges.\\n\\nYou play as part of the Yorha team, your duty is to do everything in the name of mankind, doing battle against small or rather large and grand machines, a lot of the machines have so much detail and care paid to personality that it becomes a bad feeling to be slaying them at times as you and 2B, A2 or 9S start to understand that machine life-forms have emotion and feeling just like us Androids. (I use that term because the world really felt like you were with them on the journey).\\n\\nMusically the game is in my view undoubtably in the top place for musical scores in a game, it\\'s sad, depressing, grand, gracious and absolutely astounding.\\n\\nDifficulty options are very welcome allowing new players to play with absolutely no issues, also allowing vets to take on the stupidly difficult hardest mode where you die in one hit no matter what, Has anyone actually ever beaten that? I doubt it unless it was on PC with hacks, but it\\'s there if you want a challenge.\\n\\nVisually landscapes and scenery are beautiful although the muted colors often seem like it could have been better although I\\'m not sure that would have fit the game which is why I don\\'t hold that against it.\\n\\nGameplay wise it\\'s the same old you\\'d expect from Platinum but with additions as the game seamlessly moves into a Shump mode or a kind of side scrolling mode, welcome changes in the gameplay appear at times, it\\'s something I haven\\'t seen done this well elsewhere.\\n\\nNot going to discuss the story past the brief summary I gave, It\\'s an experience one should experience and not be told.If the entire game would be anything like its first hour it would be a 10 from me. Unfortunately its not. Its an empty open-world with countless sidequests and grindy character progression, mixed in with a minimal amount of really great combat sequences with terrific camera work.After more than 50 hours of play, I can guarantee that you will love to play this game on your PS4 and your Xbox, but will hate the lack of computer version optimization; Positive points: very well done soundtrack, by composer Keichii Okabe , the soundtrack increditing in a spectacular way the scenarios.Map-design very well done, even after months without playing it is possible to remember where each thing is on the map.History and very well-directed character development ... the main story of Game makes no sense, but this is part of how it was built, the main story is just an excuse to tell the secondary story, which tries to get to the emotional of the players. The gameplay of the game is very varied, there are moments where a hack play -In-Slash, a game of ship and moments where you play some hack mini-games. When it put it all together, I thought it would not work very well, but it works incredibly well. Negative poles: lack of polishing in the PC version, it is injustment, in the computer version without the installation of Mod Far. The computer version is a shame near the console versions (Xbox One and PS4), I had the pleasure of playing it on Xbox One, I would say if I need to choose to pick up for 50 reais Automata nier on PC and 150 Reais on Xbox, I would easily pick up the console version of the game.Best storyline games on this decade , much better than boring Witcher 3 and Mass effect.[] Perfect\\n[x] Awesome\\n[] Good\\n[] Good bad\\n[] Fail\\n\\nI see no need to write a long text by analyzing an art, the note is just advice to know how much it goes to your life.\\n\\nI See No Need to Write a Long Text Analyzing an Art, The Note Is Just a Piece of Advice to Know How Much It is Worth In Your Life.Correct without displays.\\n\\nAt the beginning he promises but then he has seemed quite boring.\\n\\nI have dedicated about 4 hours and have been more than enough to eliminate it from the console.I like the way the gameplay switches instantly from side scroller, to 3d hack n slash, to bullet hell shooter, etc. And the story is interesting, but... you have to play through the first half of the game twice before it lets you go to the 2nd half. A-hole design #1. Then for the 2nd half all the enemies are scaled as if you did all the side quests on BOTH playthroughs of the 1st half. A-hole design #2. I had already seen the first half so there was no reason for me to do the side quests again, then suddenly in the 2nd half I\\'m getting 1 shot by everythingThe best versión of an all time masterpiece, Great story, characters, world setting, mechanics, soundtrack, etc.\\nNothing more to say, just play itThe game takes you through an exciting adventure with multiple points of view and an extra part once you finish the main storyline. The characters are well developed and the empathy that you develop towards them is well justified.\\nThe game lacks a better development of the antagonist and the boss\\'s fights.\\n\\nMain characters are beautifully designed.\\nYou will finish the game full of different feelings.\\n\\n*Here in Madly Geek we try always to finish the games 100%, and this one wasn\\'t an exception, and it was pretty enjoyable to do this and plus pass through the secret and special ending that is a gift from it\\'s creator, that goes along pretty well with the game\\'s philosophy.One of the best games on xbox one if now the Best game on xbox one!Not that there are many good games on xbox to compite with for that titlePlatinum Games is literally one of the best studios, and they make my favorite action games to ever exist. Bayonetta 1&2 to this day still hold the crown for best action games I have ever played and this is no different. The story is beautiful, and it really makes you think. The music sets the mood for each sequence and the atmosphere is gorgeous. I could go on and on all day, but if you loved Bayonetta or any of the DMC games, this is right up your alley. P.S. 2B is so freaking hot, just the way she walks tells you she plays no games, the character models are just, ahhh!!! Im in love. People rating this anything under a 9 are either Sony fanboys pissed off that good games are coming to a better console, or people who clearly don\\'t know what a good game is.Unfortunately, this game suffers from a very inconsistent difficulty and ends up ruining the experience for me. First it cannot be saved in the prologue which in normal can be achieved with a little persistence (but gives a bad premocion of what is yet to come). Then the game becomes very easy and the options to experiment with the Arsenal de Armas lose meaning due to the ease of the game. Finally, what ruined the experience in my opinion is the final stretch and the final boss. One of the reasons why the game is simple is because you can simply buy healing items at any time and in any amount. But for my unpleasant surprise in the end the difficulty rises to ridiculous levels due to this factor. The game simply decides to prevent you from buying more healing items. And I wonder why? The game is ridiculously easy and suddenly is madness or God. I am quite surprised because some player should have found this problem in the testing stage. My recommendation would be to play it in easy but this problem disappointed me because the game is very good.A master piece, excelent gameplay, amazing soundtrack, a great history and memorables charactersI am not a player of RPGs,\\nAnd I have not been able to play NIER Gestalt (now I really want to play it). Because this game hooked me with its history, artistic aspect (visually beautiful for me), and its combat system.\\nRecommended if you have xbox gamepass give it a try.The good:\\nExcellent graphics, good draw distance, lots of textures, lots of particles. Very good music if you like melancholic music and Japanese vocal themes. A great Japanese. Great customization of passive skills through chips that you find, farm / make or buy. This 2B “the Waifu” of many. It has good jokes and moments of involuntary comedy. Playing with 9S completely changes the gameplay. It has as many endings as letters of the alphabet. Its best playable and visual version is on Xbox One X / Series S / X. It\\'s on Xbox Game Pass.\\n\\nThe bad:\\nMix of genres (Hack\\'n Slash, Shot\\'em Up, Shump Game, Bullet Hell, Brawler, 2D Platform, 3D Platform, 2.5D Platform ...) so many that none of them do it well. To have touches of Hack\\'n Slash there is no customization of combos, they are already preset. Don\\'t be fooled, this game has 2B but it\\'s more of a game of running errands, dodging lots of red balls, and making deliveries with touches of fan service. Many many moments of other people\\'s pain. Very Japanese jokes that get lost in translation. The fishing game. There are areas such as the command center or the dressing rooms where textures and effects disappear in a brutal way. Its Pan-tone (color palette, range of colors) is very opaque, throwing more brown, brown, black and gold, mostly except in the heads where it changes to black and white that can take you out of the experience for totally white objects that seem very false. Only three types of weapons to make combinations (spear, sword / katana and great-sword).\\n\\nMeh !:\\nThis game is NOT a masterpiece or a joke, it is a good game only. This game is rated M, for the scared and those who later catch them doing dirty things in front of the TV. This game has moments of \"someone else\\'s grief\"/cringe,  uncomfortable situations that could make you feel bad if you play in front of other people (or in front of your parents or in front of your partner or in front of interested people). The game is good and fun if you like the Japanese and the games of Navecitas / Matamarcianos and Bullet Hell. It has a very basic fishing minigame that will make you laugh. You don\\'t have to play Drakengard 3 to understand him, but it helps. The phrase \"masterpiece\" is released with an ease that is scary and more referring to a game that, although technically good, has many playable deficiencies and sometimes it is well argued and other times its argument \"leaks everywhere\" ... the game is good, transgressive, uncomfortable, ridiculous, full of cliche, pedantic ... but not a masterpiece. To play with your character without a skirt or pants is not a Mod, seriously, no mods are necessaryIt looks and feels like an indie, everything is very basic and there is nothing special about the story.This has to be one of the most weird, unique, and creative games ever made. There are countless memorable and thought-provoking moments. I would even describe some of them as powerful. I really enjoyed the open world, the depth of the combat, the serene soundtrack, and the engaging story and characters. My only grievances are some of the weaker side quests and the story can be a little too abstract, especially if you don’t do a little homework on it’s lore beforehand. I will be contemplating this game for a long time.A true Masterpiece. Easily the best story ever told in a video game. Gameplay is very fun. Visuals are great and audio is among the best. The game has every element that you expect in a great game and much more. The game starts great and gets better as you progress, and in the end, well... you must see for yourself. This game will stay in my memories forever. Thanks PlatinumGames and Square Enix.I rarely spend money on games, because I often regret buying them after a while. But this time, my friend advised me to play it, and it was like I\\'ve returned to my childhood when I could play games with bated breath without sleep. Wonderful game.NieR:Automata is a fantastically immersive game. The combat and music really make it a must play, but just like with every masterpiece something is off, for NieR:Automata it‘s the maps and very unfitting artstyle. The maps just don‘t really fit with the overall artsyle, which makes it hard to look at some of the areas. In BOTW the map never had boring or unrelateable areas. In the first resistance camp the characters look like actual humans, but why doesn’t our character look like a human as well or wiseversa. If you can look over this minor annoyance this will be just the game for you.Highlights include a superlative musical score, memorable characters and overall just a top-notch game.\\n\\nI went into this as a stop-gap between AAA games I was playing (Death Stranding and Last of Us 2) thinking this should be a different experience. I can now understand the high-scores and universal acclaim and am now obsessed with the game and scanning any news about it everywhere.absolute master piece in every aspect -music band is overtaking every other gameThe best example that a good story is not an excuse not to make a good gameplay.It doesn\\'t matter how you play this video game, because you will always have fun: if you play quiet and with background music, you can enjoy the combos and the speed of the fighting.If you take it more seriously, you will have one of the most incredible experiences that you will ever have in a video game ... an amazing story, unforgettable characters and a soundtrack ... Puff, one of the best I remember in my life.\\n\\nSo that you see to what extent this game has marked me, I started playing it for the Hack & Slash and the Waifus fanservice, and I stayed to finish a game that has only impressed me more with every hour I played it.If I have not given it a 10 it is because graphically it is quite improvable.Awesome game even if it becomes a bit repetitive at the end, definitely worth the different playthroughs.Awesome game, mainly the Original SoundTrack. Highly recommended to those who like action PRG\\'s.Everything about this game is beautiful, especially the music. I\\'m not exaggerating when I say that this game\\'s full soundtrack is the best musical album of all times, and that\\'s not just limited to game soundtracks.\\n\\nAfter a few decades of playing games, out of the thousands I\\'ve played, there\\'s only half a handful I\\'d give a perfect 10, and Nier: Automata is one of them. It raised the bar even higher, and it\\'s only going to be even more difficult for me to give any future games a perfect score.\\nBecause in my opinion, a perfect score is only for perfect games.\\nNier: Automata is perfect.A total master piece! A philosophical journey about meaning and purpose driven by a story full of emotion and interesting characters.I love this game I fell in love with it during the first hour and it just kept on giving. Platinum keep doing what you\\'re doing!Nier automata is amazing in so many ways. The game is so mind blowing when played right. People often will play nier, complete route A and call it quits. This is a huge mistake as there are 5 endings, E being the true one. Another off putting part of nier is to achieve ending e you must get the 4 previous endings which is a very tedious task and often demotivates people. I still however think it\\'s worth it as each new route has a different style of fighting or a new mechanic to make it more interesting plus you get to hear more about the machines perspective each route which changes the boss battles from \"epic fights against big machines\" to \"epic fights with big machines meaning and motives\" my only complain is the gameplay itself which often feels repetitive and boring and a lot of the times I find myself in extremely awkward angles when the angle of the perspective tries to change but due to bugs it does it wrong sometimes. Other than that this game is a straight 9I would like to start with some FAQs:\\n1) How to save? -> After the tutorial, you can manually save almost all over the world, as long as the area is safe. For that you just have to unlock the checkpoints.\\n2) Is there fasttravel? -> A fasttravel system is available after a few hours of gameplay. You can then travel back and forth between the unlocked checkpoints. But before that you have to walk everything.\\n\\n+ The maps/worlds are beautiful and varied - no matter if industrial, desert or forest area. At the beginning the world is quite big, but after the 1st walkthrough I have to say that it could have been a bit more.\\n+ The story is good.\\n+ A lot of action - sometimes as a 2D twin-stick shooter, most of it in nice 3D graphics.\\n+ Cool bosses\\n+/- The 2nd walkthrough I can only conditionally recommend. The 3rd walkthrough is then really annoying. The enemies are 10-20 levels higher and you can\\'t buy any items at the beginning. Without health boost it became so annoying that I quit the game. Big minus.\\n- The \"tutorial\" (a kind of introductory map) really ticked me off. It goes about 1h and if you die at the end, you have to start all over again. You can\\'t save in the tutorial either. And the stupidest thing is that in the tutorial is not shown how to use the health items manually.\\n\\n__\\n\\nIch möchte mit einigen FAQs beginnen:\\n1) Wie kann man speichern? -> Nach dem Tutorial kann man fast in der ganzen Welt manuell speichern, sofern das Gebiet sicher ist. Dafür müsst ihr einfach die Checkpoints freischalten.\\n2) Gib es Fasttravel? -> Ein Fasttravel-System gibt es nach ein paar Stunden Gameplay. Ihr könnt dann zwischen den freigeschalteten Checkpoints hin und herreisen. Vorher müsst ihr aber alles zu Fuss gehen.\\n\\n+ Die Maps/Welten sind schön und abwechslungsreich - egal ob Industrie-, Wüsten-, oder Wald-Gebiet. Zu Beginn wirk die Welt ziemlich gross, aber nach dem 1. Walkthrough muss ich sagen, dass es noch etwas mehr hätte sein dürfen.\\n+ Die Story ist gut.\\n+ Viel Action - mal als 2D Twin-Stick-Shooter, der grösste Teil in hübscher 3D-Grafik.\\n+ Coole Bosse\\n+/- Der 2. Walkthrough kann ich nur bedingt empfehlen. Es werden einige Aspekte der Geschichte von einer anderen Seite her beleuchtet, und mit dem Charakter 9S hat man etwas andere Kampfmöglichkeiten, aber unter dem Strich lohnen sich die zusätzlichen und sehr ähnlichen 10h nur bedingt. Der 3. Walkthrough ist dann richtig nervig. Die gegner sind 10 - 20 Level höher und man kann zu Beginn keine Items mehr kaufen. Ohne Health-Boost wurde es so annoying, dass ich das Spiel abgebrochen habe. Grosses Minus.\\n- Das \"Tutorial\" (eine Art Einführungsmap) hat mich richtig angekackt. Es geht ca. 1h und wenn man am Ende stirbt, muss man alles von vorne Beginnen. Man kann im Tutorial auch nicht speichern. Und das dümmste ist, dass im Tutorial nicht gezeigt wird, wie man die Health-Items manuell benutzt.I enjoyed the hell out of this game and the uniwersum,\\n\\nNormally I would be pissed of while re-playing kind of the story, here I did not mind at all and stayed glued to my console playing for hours.\\n\\nGameplay is fun, but I think the main attraction here is in story + characters.\\nLoved this experience.\\n\\n9/10Amazing my favorite game is one of those games that makes you think and reflect on life I recommend without fear.\\nNote: only sin of the game is not subtitled.Spectacular game from beginning to end I love A2 and his huge ... hearts get something like the game but it\\'s a jewelA little bit overwhelming at the beginning but definitively this an entertaining game with an awesome story. The characters seem to be a little bland but I assume is because they\\'re androids. The story narrative and game play however are superb.… ExpandGame is good, graphics, soundtrack, characters, setting, it\\'s all good.2b and A2 are beautifulImiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiWithout being an AAA, this game is wonderful, Yoko Taro has a gift for going out of the ordinary and giving us exceptionally dystopian stories, with a quite polished and fun gameplay, and perhaps one of the best soundtracks in history, turns this game in one of the best of this generation. I hope and in the future Yoko can have a bigger budget to give us something even more legendary.This game is literally a three part story across 20-25 hours if you\\'re not doing additional side quests and item hunting for God tier weaponry and chips for your chip set. The story is so intertwined within itself and how it makes you replay it from a different perspective makes the same story feel absolutely different, all while listening to a beautiful soundtrack they dynamically changes on scenery and mood transitions throughout your epic journey to find out the true meaning of life in this futuristic world.This game is such a hidden gem. Took me years to discover this incredible journey and I don\\'t know why I never heard about NIER before. It\\'s a game unlike anything I\\'ve played and I love it. Incredible work on the soundtrack.Nier Automata is by far the best game of this generation.Games, music, story atmosphere, art design is allocated.We have reached perfection.Being the script written and produced by Yoko Taro, I found the story very simple for me, where: you are in a land devastated by extraterrestrial machines, being 2b, a yohra soldier, a Android Squad that is responsible for protecting The remnants of the ancient world - eliminating the machines - so that, finally, the remaining humans who went to the moon due to the attack of these machines on Earth, to return to their origin planet. At first, I thought it would be a pure fanservice game with a simple story and nice gameplay to pass time, but I was well mistaken about how the beginning of this simple story, becomes developed by dealing with subjects such as existentialism and Nilism along with the unique essence of each character and the way every resistance environment within the game - being machines or androids - having a different way of governor, making even Androids protagonists doubt this \"false human essence\" present in the machines. Anyway, besides all these subjects that are treated very well in the work, the game, of course, knows very well to move the thrill of the player, impacting each striking event, and that was so strong that for me, in the end From the game, I had the same anguish and the same indecision I had when I played the Last of US part 2, really was amazing and that\\'s where the soundtrack comes in, making all this emotion pass the player beyond the plot. The soundtrack of the game responsible for Keiichi Okabe, unlike its composition of the game Nier, in Nier: Automata, is a trail in which you will feel good listening, the music of the internships, fights and the open world are incredibly beautiful and What is more amazed is that the lyrics of these trails are from a language within the game: the angelic language. And I emphasize that unlike the game NIER, where the trail is notorious that making the player feel like the protagonist, passing the feelings of euphoria, sadness, fear and even recognizing his madness. In Nier: Automata, the songs are so beautiful that you can download on your mobile and listen freely, no wonder there are several Japanese concerts with the game\\'s soundtrack. And now, last but not least: the gameplay. Being produced by Platinum Games, Nier\\'s gameplay: Automata is very free, rewarding the fact that it is a hack n \\'slash game (very enemy on the screen and you just have to go down) and not have so many combos between a weapon heavy and light; This company has made the game more dynamic with large varieties of weapons, using the wrist as even special gloves, spears, heavy/light swords and even with the variety of types of shots that can be equipped by the POD, one Yohra Android Assistant, a way of shooting long -distance targets within the game. In addition to these varieties of weapons, it would obviously enter the upgrade system, and that\\'s where the gameplay of this game can reward you. Being an open chip storage system, where with the course of the game you will get other types of these, for example, being one that lets you give a bigger or another that increases the damage of your pod if you are a person who likes to attack from afar. That is why the gameplay shines within this work, because you will customize with the course of the plot, the way you want to play, thus leaving the game with vast gameplay options, besides the great experimentalism of Yoko Taro present in the plot, Varying the 3D to 2.5D game, Space Shooter and Mech Warrior (those games where you are a giant robot fighting another gigantic being). In addition, there are still the other 3 protagonists of the game that make Playstyle change a lot\\n\\nAnyway, this was my review of the game Nier: Automata, a game that I recommend a lot and that certainly became my favorite game.\\nBeing the director and screenwriter of the whole series, I really thank Yoko Taro for this great work.Amazing story and memorable characters.Excelent soundtrack.Good combat system.Just sublime advised by a friend I do not regret a second to have listened to itLittle to say about this jewel, only if you have had it for the first time, do not leave it, keep playing and get the 5 main finals, believe me it is worth it.This game is simply amazing, a true masterpiece ... I don\\'t believe it so long that it took me to play, buy, they won\\'t regret it.Beautiful Soundtrack, History, All characters\\nEach of its finals including the joke are goodThe truth has been a game that its beginning excites a lot, when you give your open world you already start to have the desire to discover each recesses of the map, both its main and secondary missions leave you so thoughtful that at the time of reflecting, they give you Desire to change the whole world. Just experience to better understand the mechanisms that give you, after experiencing a lot you will get the optimal and desired result. They believe that it makes it repetitive and boring, no. R Second time, certain details change, in addition to the gameplay, that makes you not easily fall into boredom. It is a game that surprises from the beginning to end, I planned to find a cliché story but I only found a very rare history and depth in The stories. Soundtrack is memorable and catchy, in addition its atmosphere fits too well with the story that is presented to us in the game. I have criticized the game very well, however they fail something, after obtaining the improvements successful level (not necessary the maximum level) the game becomes absurdly easy, feeling you as an untouchable being on many occasions.Masterpiece. I enjoyed the gameplay, but the music, atmosphere and design are the real piece of artwork for me. I got crazy about the story behind of this setting after playing.Probably a hidden gem for most players. Runs excellent at 60fps and running with your character is really fast and fun. The music is awesome and the change of perspectives is nice too.\\n\\nAdvice: play before it gets removed from game pass.For the story nier automata really nailed it and for the gameplay it never gets old but my only problem her is the game not having a dynamic level design for enemies like when I started route C I was level 34 but they brought enemies from level 50 and above so I had to repeat my 12 hours of playing and add 5 hours more just to level up to 56 so I can beat the enemies in route C easily and the graphics for a 2017 game isn\\'t that revolutionary.Great game, high playability and inmersing history, the RPG elements are quite creative, a must play for fans!!!this is the best game i have ever played in my whole life, the story, the music, the gameplay, the side quests, ITS JUST WONDERFUL.   10/10Gameplay : 8/10\\nDesign (video + audio) : 8/10\\nStory : 10/10\\nTechnical aspects : 9/10\\nRepeatability: 10/10The game is one of the best that has played, is in a top number 5 of my whole life in which I have played from the classics to the new releases and never via so much gameplay, many mechanics, open world, history, characters and theAbsolutely stronger point is his incredible impeccable soundtrack, maybe he of many wings and praise to the game but it is to my personal opinion one of the best of all time.… ExpandPros:\\n- Fluid and satisfactory controls.\\n- Frenetic fighting.\\n- Luxury narrative, touching sensitive issues that are not generally addressed in the industry.\\n- Decent and moving history, with endearing characters throughout the game.\\n- Variety of weapons.\\n- Excellent and memorable Soundtrack.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Although justifiable for history, the world is empty. Too.\\n- It tends to be unfair and punish the one who does not know the mechanics or controls, as it is a speed and precision game.\\n- There is no general motive that motivates to rejugar, such as trying different types of Builds because although there are a variety of weapons, they only change their timing.\\n- There is no automatic save, and it can be a problem after eating hours.\\n\\nNier: Automates as Hack & Slash is a great game with exquisite gameplay and mechanics that addresses not so explored songs and executes them well. The world justifies its history, but has large deficiencies that can ruin the player\\'s experience at times. In addition, it is understood that the artistic style does not manage to catch everyone. On the other hand, the fasevice is not very much liked in video games.Nier Automata is a good game capado, a story that despises to inspire something else stays in a game that without being shit is quite a duty, the combat is very customizable with the chips, however they can also be confused and/or littleIntuitive, like secondary missions, the fight is very good but there came a time when I felt tired and I just wanted to end and pressed the RT trigger just to pass everything fast, the game is easy to break.9S as a character I like, especially in the last part of the end but has a poor fight not only compared to the other characters but also as individual- it is worth playing it but you can not go with the expectations of seeing something groundbreaking.This game is like emotional rollercoaster. Yoko Taro did great job. Soundtrack synchronized with gameplay pretty well. This game is so unique that you can hardly find game like this. My rating is only for Story, Music and uniqueness. I am so glad that I played this game,It was an amazing experience. This game make you ask yourself \"Is this world really meaningless?\"...I love this game so much that I feel that no matter what I write here I will never be able to express how much I loved the experience of playing this work.\\nIgnoring the fact that textures are well blurred in some places, I can say that in all other points the game is impeccable, such as gameplay, soundtrack, and especially its history and its universe.\\nThe definition of art, a masterpiece!An excellent game with good story and nice gameplay. There are so many different endings in this game but there are 3 main endings and you play 3 characters in each ending. All of them were cool to play. But I will be honest this did not blew my mind. This was a damn good game but not enough for 10/10THE STORY AND THE MUSIC ARE FANTASTIC! If you want the full experience you NEED to play all 3 main storylines: 2b, 9S, A2. There\\'s other alternate endings but those are the main 3. The story unravels slowly as you play each characters play through and it\\'s worth the extra hours. the combat reminds me of Bayonetta with the amount of action going on screen and needing to keep up but the developers are platinum games who MADE Bayonetta so not surprised but. If you haven\\'t played Bayonetta then you\\'re gonna have to get used to that QUICKLY as you move up in the game. Unpopular opinion but Simone( the second boss you fight) is the BEST boss with the best boss music. Also hold L3 and R3 buttons together you\\'ll thank me later.… ExpandThis is the most unique game I\\'ve ever played can\\'t wait to see what Yoko Taro does next, this is a must playBeautiful soundtrack, art direction, and interactions. While the ending is tedious to acquire and my biggest complaint, it\\'s still a overall wonderful experience. A game that deserved the praises and positive reviews it gets, from those are actually played it atleast. Played this on Steam but Im glad they went to release it on the Xbox, it\\'s a game they don\\'t want to miss out on.',\n",

The visuals, the atmosphere, the gameplay mechanics they\\'re all so wonderful! This game has some really dark themes from suicide to miscarriage, if you explore everything in the game you will come across all sorts of dark themes. When I mentioned gameplay mechanics I was talking about the memories you get from defeating each enemy and learning their life before they died. Gameplay itself is nothing special. It\\'s decent enough and while i found it fun, the gameplay not being anything deep might not be everyone\\'s cup of tea. It can also get sort of repetitive but for story reasons. Now the story, wow this story is such a rich and well written story. The story is very original, it\\'s not generic or anything. Just when you think you\\'ve figured out the story it just pulls you back in and sends you off into another direction. It\\'s one of my favorite videogame stories I\\'ve ever had the privilege to play through. This is why I give this game a 10. Gameplay might not be anything special but the story is fantastic that it makes up for its few flaws. I highly recommend this wonderful game! Plus there\\'s a dog in the game you can pet, easily a 10/10.A masterpiece in every sense of the word, beautiful graphics, a delightful piano soundtrack, and brilliant writing.\\n\\nThe fact the Western branch decided to completely ignore this in exchange for promoting the dreadful Net Idol Torture Porn game called \"AI: The Somnium Files\" is proof that their marketing team is incompetent in every possible way.Advantages\\n- Plot. No seriously. Before us is a very elegant, beautiful story, filled with plot turns, and the narrative sets up a lot of tips and Chekhov rifles, and I myself sometimes had to feel like a genius, predicting the development of the plot for the chapter or two, and clap myself on the forehead, realizing that He missed all the hints and semi -Germani, who at one moment gained meaning.\\n- characters all up to one charisma, starting from the charming of the Rea, ending with the sinister but in their charming demons Gemini, all of whom get their share of the place in the sun, and personal plot arches manage to replace at the moment when thought runs through your head \"It would be nice to learn more about x.\" Even those of them who would not hurt to open a little better (Nanami, Kuon and Mirai) remain alive and memorable.\\n- Visual style, starting from panoramic species on the purgatory and realistic animation of persons in katsen, ending with detailed and beautiful sprites of characters, stylized for rude pencil drawings by flashbacks\\n- The setting, although it periodically does not hide at all that he looked at the immortal SMT and his much more popular spin-off in the person of the person, still looks and feels original and interesting.\\n- a soundtrack from a mixture of orchestral and electronic music, forcing him to take it entirely\\n- The stylization and atmosphere of the tragic story with the slight raid of the Gothic, which consists of many little things, starting from the theme of tears and crying, with which the main character as improves her equipment and receives strength for the battle in battles, becoming stronger passing through deprivation and pain Continuing the creative design of the Hab menu, depicting a Reusa behind different household matters with unchanged melancholy emotions on the face, ending with such an excellent find as the memoirs of the dead, allowing us to find out about the short and often tragic history of life and the death of those people whose ghosts we are in the ghosts We hunt.\\n- Separately, I note the English voice acting, made surprisingly high level.\\nFlaws\\n- Gameplay, what made the estimates from Metakritic stop on a weak seven. A monotonous and repetitive gameplay with repainted models of the same type of opponents of different colors makes in the last third of the game just to run through them through the next portion of the plot or refreshing the battle with the boss.\\n- Of the four game characters, only two work normally.\\n- In the plot you can notice a couple of story holes with a thoughtful look, especially in the epilogue.\\n- chaotic and rather stupid ending, seriously breaking one of the key storylines. ... ExpandThe gameplay is a bit boring, but the story and the characters in this game are so good! The soundtrack by Sakuzyo is also great.Let me just say that yes, the game has some flaws (mostly when it comes to gameplay), but despite those flaws I enjoyed my playthrough so much that I\\'m giving it a 10/10 regardless. I\\'ll instead rate each individual element of the game below to give an idea of what to expect going in.\\n\\nMusic: 10/10\\nAn absolute gem of a soundtrack. Severally limited by the game due to some weird sound mixing and prioritization. Some sound testing with the volume settings might be needed to find a good balance between music, voice and sound effects. The OST is full of leitmotifs, variety and outer-worldly tunes. There\\'s some rock tracks that go HARD, some real tearjerkers, surprise jazz and plenty of violin/piano goodness.\\n\\nGraphics: 8/10.\\nLooks pretty enough and there\\'s nothing wrong about it. Some attack animations and effects are really flashy and enjoyable. But the visual thing that\\'ll really catch your attention is...\\n\\nArt and Art Direction: 10/10\\nIt\\'s gorgeous. The game\\'s cutscenes feature a visual novel-esque formate with character art for each character with dialogue. It\\'s incredibly pretty, detailed and it isn\\'t afraid to change even the most minute facial details to reflect the characters current mood. There are also these really artistc drawing-esque cutscenes for memory segments that are quite striking. There\\'s also this really nice Studio Trigger intro animation that plays whenever you start the game.\\n\\nVoice Acting: 10/10\\nI\\'m blown away. I played the game with English voice-acting because someone recommended it and I\\'m very pleasantly surprised on how good it was. Even some of the minor background voices are really well acted. The main cast absolutely nailed their roles and even weaved in their personalities whenever exposition was dumped (props for the writer for not making exposition be dragged out and boring).\\n\\nStory: 9/10\\nI thoroughly enjoyed the story and all it\\'s twists. I found myself making theories about how things were going to play out and got dumbfounded when some revelations were revealed. The best thing is that the game foreshadows a lot, but it\\'s practically impossible to understand any of it without context. It\\'s a very cohesive and thought out narrative, with some very emotional moments to boot. The AAA-game market really need to step-up their stories. There has been so many AA and indie games that completely overshadow the AAA-games story-wise recently. All that budget and most big studios can\\'t even write a compelling story...\\n\\nGameplay: 6.5/10.\\nOkay this is the least good aspect of the game. It isn\\'t bad, the core gameplay is very fun and fluid once you get a hang for it. But the enemy variety and level design is lacking severely.\\n\\nEnemy Variety: There are like 10 or so enemies in the game (not counting bosses) which you\\'ll fight over and over again. They sometimes gain a new move, but it gets stale. Some skill unlocks and enemy density helps the game feel fresh throughout a playthrough, but it still gets a bit monotonous at times.\\n\\nLevel Design: The environments you go through are very pretty, but the areas you directly move your character around in usually only consist of rectangular flat rooms. Sometimes there are a bit more complex rooms with cover and some slopes/stairs to add a bit of verticality. The game could\\'ve used the addition of traps/boons, some more tailor-made set pieces and generally more intuitive level design depending on where the areas were set. For example: there was this stage where you story-wise ascended a tower, but that wasn\\'t reflected in the level design, which was a huge missed opportunity. The placements for items and treasure chests are also very predictable and not so exciting. Only very late in the game did the game surprise me with the occasional bundle of treasure/item nodes.\\n\\nThe gameplay will be more enjoyable for some than others, The fluidity and earn-able skills make the gameplay addictive, which can help some people stomach the lack of enemy and level variety. Although it seems like one of the gameplay designers really hated 1 of the 4 playable characters specifically, since her gameplay is absolute hot rubbish compared to the other 3 characters.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIf your looking for a incredibly rewarding visual and auditory experience then I highly recommend this game. The gameplay, despite it\\'s flaws, is really fun in moderations. It really just lacks in enemy/level variety, which might be because of budget/time constraints.This type of game isn\\'t going to be for everyone - as JRPGs go it also is a bit unique. I loved the characters each one felt unique and had their own personality and quirks. The art style can be a bit overbearing at times and you do end up with an overall feeling that the game play is repetitive.\\nThe story does deliver several gut punches at several points in the game and as the story progresses you get a good idea where the plot is going, but feel compelled to find out how it gets there and what the next thing to unfold will be.\\n\\nThe game is split in to chapters each having a certain number of stages and you return to your room as the hub world where you can perform tasks to purify your heart and level up equipment.\\n\\nSpoilers ahead:\\nOnce you complete the game on the first pass you do get an epilogue which sends you back in to a sort of new game + mode but with a different story and twist it would seem at first glance. The more times you complete the game the more story unlocks and the more puzzle pieces fit together. After all it is purgatory.\\nThe nit pick I have here is that the maps don\\'t change on the next part of the story. Also to complete the bestiary you have to kill 3 of each kind of spirit - and 3 of the more powerful types (I forget what they are called) and with the same monster type appearing over and over it can be frustrating to find the ones you are missing.\\n\\nGameplay   : 8\\nPlot    : 9\\nCharacters : 9 (love Nanana )\\nSoundtrack :  9\\nOverall    : 9… ExpandThe story, storytelling, characters and the world building are very good. If you like serious toned JRPGs you\\'ll like this one too.Grief coated in sadness painted with tragedy dipped in suffering. I\\'ve never seen so much emotional torture stuffed into one package before. Be warned the game is hyperfocused on sadness and hardly subtle about it, using it to fuel the story and even for game mechanics. It\\'s hard not to relate to the protagonist - or any of the cast really - and feel bad yourself about what she has to suffer through, so one should prepare themselves for quite the ride.\\n\\nI bought the game literally only due to another review pointing out it had Sakuzyo\\'s soundtrack. I ended up greatly enjoying it overall though. While my enjoyment was brought down by some frustrating fights and, frankly, very bad decisions on boss mechanics (spamming multiple homing attacks is not funny), combat was hardly the main point in the first place. The atmosphere, story and characters were carrying the game and it was clearly intended to be as such. That being said, the combat wasn\\'t some afterthought either, or quickly slapped on top - it just didn\\'t quite live up to the rest of the features. Besides, though I at times disliked how basic it was, the combat did actually begin to feel pretty satisfying towards the end when skills became more flashy and powerful.\\n\\nSince the combat is fairly repetitive and levels can be somewhat maze-like, I recommend running past most normal fights. The random treasure you can pick up while exploring isn\\'t worthwhile either, as upgrade materials are easy and quick to farm later on as needed. Due to this, I finished the game severely underleveled in some 20 hours, but didn\\'t really find that a problem. I do plan on 100%ing it, which basically means unlocking some additional mini stories by defeating certain enemies.Fun action JRPG with a unique story. Character models and levels are really detailed and colorful. Feels like you\\'re playing an anime. All in all a fun game.Crystar has been one of my favourite games this year. just like how Nanana puts it \"it\\'s Fun and Exciting\"\\n\\nGAMEPLAY\\nThe gameplay isn\\'t bad, but it\\'s not great. It feels a bit outdated, you get combos, and can make your own as well just by chain attacks. but once you do it once, its get repetitive. the only thing that changes is your Skills which are unique to each of the 4 characters. its not difficult. on Normal i may have killed off a couple of the characters twice, just to bring them back within a second using an item that is fairly cheap. Attack Chains are very generous letting you get to over 300 hits on bosses, and 100 on smaller enemies when there is a few.\\n\\nThis is a JRPG, so you get to level each of the 4 characters (using one character will level the other 3, but with less XP). There is Skills as mentioned before which unlock at various levels, Sentiments that you get from Crying your soul out to pure the Torments you have gotten from mini Bosses during Ordeals (the Games quests) and Sentiments with buffs (extra HP and Immunity to enemy effects etc). Each character gets 1 Attack Sentiment, 1 Defence and 2 Extra sentiments that can change all your stats or give you extra Immunity types to enemy effects.\\n\\nCHARACTERS\\nEach character is unique and has their own personality. Rei the Shut-in that just wants to save Mirai, Kokoro the House Wife type which lost her future Husband and Baby and wants revenge on Anamnesis (1 of 4 Antagonists), Sen who lost her mum in a bus Accident and lives for Justice and rules, Nanana who is a child that died in the real world and became a Revenant that later joined Rei because she treated her unlike the other Revenants (her back story is tragic, and involves rope, and sad parents)\\n\\nSTORY\\nthe story pulls you in as you save your sister, and the plot twists throughout keep you on your toes. most of the tragedies are reverted as you start the next playthrough to get the TRUE ending. unlike some games that require you to choose options and that chooses your fate, the options you get don\\'t change the outcome, it just makes you feel bad for doing it.\\n\\nOnce you get to the end of the first Playthrough, you go back to the beginning with a small difference to the plot, and after that intro, you fast-forward to Chapter 6 which is a nice touch because everything from now on slowly changes to get the next ending. repeat this once more and you get a new chapter to get the real true ending, which is sad and happy... just because because everything is happy in the end doesn\\'t make the previous events less dark.\\n\\nGRAPHICS\\nThe Art Style is great, and the character models are good, but the world textures are your classic Japanese game, low res and smooth, except for the nice Bloom and reflective surfaces that reflect the games sky box. with all the levels in the sky, the sky boxes look great, while the only level is has a different atmosphere with it being dark and surrounded by water which looks great with the light particles floating around. The Effects of the weapons are also some of the best i have seen in a JRPG.\\n\\nOVERALL\\nIf you can overcome the games simple Gameplay and play for the story like i did, you can see yourself play this game just to see the ending. you can watch it on YouTube if you like as well (i have a full playthrough on my Channel: Katsudon96 Gaming) you get attached to characters and when something you weren\\'t expecting to that character, you start to get sad. I was always rooting for one character, and then immediately shove the other in the dirt just because they did something i didn\\'t like.\\n\\nTop notch game… ExpandI loved Crystar. Yes, there are some weak points in repetitiveness and also in the characters themselves, but in the end, it wasn\\'t a game I regretted buying new, and here I sit, wanting the games I am playing from my \"next\" list to be more like Crystar.\\n\\nA few words of warning: this game is dark. It contains a very haunting scene of a child\\'s suicide, done in childlike yet realistic and haunting sketch art,  and it references miscarriage, death, neglect, torture, and abuse. Many involving children. You fill in a Memoirs of the Dead, that tells three episodes of the tragic lives and deaths of the spirits that you are contracted to execute.\\n\\nThe game is an action JRPG about a girl named Rei who is sucked into Purgatory for some unknown (at the time) reason, and while  wandering around, discovers that her odd little sister Mirai has been sucked in with her. In an odd chain of events, she develops powers and ends up stabbing Mirai. Insert the \"curators\" of Purgatory, two mischievous girls who promise that if she becomes their warrior and then executes the rebellious stray  souls, and also collects humans tears that form a substance called Idea, they will revive Mirai. The catch? She only has until Mirai wanders through too the Cogs of Renewal that will reincarnate her.\\nAs Rei starts her journey, she will, of course, meet other girls on their own journeys.\\n\\nPros:\\nBackground - The background is a beautiful and mesmerizing trip through gothic, dark, majestic, and even whimsical lands.\\nSoundtrack- The soundtrack supplies an expansive, and also mesmerizing classical soundtrack that uses violins to make your emotions connect to the beautiful backgrounds.\\nGraphics & Art - I have no complaints about the character stylings, and it creates a stark contrast to the dark, childlike, and jerky illustration scenes done in a haunting sepia.\\nGameplay - Action RPG where you use both weapons and SP magic attacks. Magic attacks unlock as you gain levels. You can also collect tears to unleash a power attack, and then a super attack using your Guardian. Your Guardian is essentially your inner strength, and essentially the only moment anyone can connect this game to Persona (read that review calling it a Persona clone and laughed).\\nThe Map - Why mention the map? Well, if you\\'ve ever played an old school JRPG, or even Kingdom Hearts, you know how amazing a good map can be. This one folds and expands, highlights enemies as red dots, and it even shows you where you have yet to travel.\\n\\nCons-\\nCharacters- The characters delve heavily into almost dissolving on themselves in their effort to find a crusade our a cause to believe in. Rei herself goes through a whiny and selfish phase, and I honestly almost reached my max on hearing Mirai\\'s name. Yes, I was flinching by the middle. The second character she meets is obsessed with her cause, to the level of blindness. And the third is fixated on the only cause that allows her to function. Until it threatens to become a hard lesson in humanity and exceptions.\\nRepetitiveness-This was mentioned in the beginning. To avoid spoilers, just know that the true end requires you to replay some of the same levels and the same bosses over and over...and over. You restart at the X point, and replay your fate.\\n\\nOverall, I was happy to get the the ending, but at the same time, I was sad afterwards. I\\'ll miss Sen. I\\'ll miss Anamnesis, and dammit I will especially miss canine sweetheart Thelema. Clocking in at about 40 hours of gameplay if you take your time, and at about 86-90 for a Platinum if you take your time, I defeated it on easy, and was left glaring at the next game I moved on to. I played for so long, that I changed the controls in Ys to match Crystar. It left a lingering impression, and it left me feeling appreciative for what the art team and the designers set out to create. It stands out from the pack as a truly unique and beautiful journey.It\\'s a competent ARPG. Combat is smooth, not too difficult nor too easy. The story\\'s quite sad but it\\'s pretty well written. Overall a good game.This is a dark game with good story and gameplay, nice soundtrack, repetitive.Great music, nice story, and a decent gameplay, Loved the game. and it`s dark tone.Great art and music plus a decent story. The combat is serviceable but unfortunately it\\'s way too easy and areas tend to drag on for too long. It\\'s still mindless fun but too repetitive for its own good. Worth playing if you can find it on sale.The story is the strongest part of the game and I absolutely love it but unfortunately, the same can\\'t be said for the gameplay. I want to give it a higher rating but I\\'d be lying to myself because the difficulty is utterly laughable and the enemies are a complete joke and provide no challenge other than being mooks that you whack with a weapon to get stronger to whack stronger mooks and being spoiled by Kingdom Hearts 3 is also why I can\\'t give it higher than a 7.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in it for the story, there\\'s a really good one but if for the gameplay, play Kingdom Hearts 3 or Devil May Cry 5 instead: all are Hack and Slash Titles like this one but miles better than this one.Awesome story and characters. Very fun. Love the art design and the music too.THIS IS FOR ANYONE ENTICED BY THE USER SCORE! I bought the game and it is an uninspired mess! I have played several hours and literally every battle can be won by going close to the enemy and pressing square until the enemy dies. There is absolutely zero challenge in this game. You learn all sorts of moves that basically have zero utility and you get a persona like being that also is not necessary to win any of this game\\'s easy battles. Having played as long as I have, I have encountered about 3-4 unique enemies. In essence, I have spent like 6-7 hours fighting the same 3-4 enemies ad nauseum. You get new characters but they play almost exactly like the main character does in the context of the game itself. All you do is run and attack things with any of the characters. THAT\\'S IT! Do not be fooled by the fact that it has a great user score. I am not sure what these people were thinking but some are suggesting the combat is not too easy. It is the easiest combat I have come across since every single battle can be won by running from enemy to enemy and pressing square until you win. This is made especially easy since there are about 3-4 enemy types and you quickly learn their patterns. Not that you need to because they do basically no damage to you. I have yet to use an item, I have yet to die, I have yet to feel challenged in any way, I have yet to buy anything from the in game merchant, I have not grinded at all and I can go through every level with zero threat. Not good, if we are being honest.Crystar is a game that has a great premise, but is progressively decaying and the end disappointing.The combat system is medium, the soundtrack is good and the story is interestingsome kind of jerking is sitting in 10 best games .... I understand, I understand that this is fucked upThe game isn\\'t a masterpiece, it just has a ton of fake positive reviews. It\\'s not the best ps4 game ever released.

With some exceptions.\\n\\nThe main character Rei Hatada is the best character to use for combat she has more variety with combos & magic attacks making her the most balances & interesting to use.\\nThe second (Because I don\\'t want to spoil) character is a pretty great as a character in terms of story & writing but she\\'s awful in combat, slow but heavy hits make combat a chore & is one of the reasons why I didn\\'t finish the game I have would liked to but It\\'s just not for me.\\n\\nOh, I forgot the Soundtrack... Well, it\\'s okay but it does it\\'s job well in the background but let\\'s just say I really love the song \"Room\" It\\'s great.\\n\\nGame with great potential but held back by grind & repetition, not a bad game just average.\\nBut that\\'s probably the worst part.Anime fans literally have no sense of taste. Loli-bait like this is a perfect ten in their eyes.Unfortunately it is not a genre that pleases many people and I believe it could be better workedWho rated this game so high??????? The second game is TW3 with 92 score and this is 96? Outrageous!… ExpandI don\\'t like the story too much it\\'s horrible, and too disappointing.

       " 'Loved this game. This might be the best game ive played.i love all the horror,puzzles,and mysteries in this game. That is what makes resident evil...resident evil.i think its the best resident evilI am a huge Resident Evil fan. I\\'ve been playing the game since it first came out on the Playstation back in 1996. When I heard that they were remaking the first game, I first thought that it would be horrible. Remakes usually are. However when I played this game, I got an enormous rush of fun and fear that I had not felt since the first time I played the original. This game is pretty much flawless. The story is still great, and the little expansions to the story they added between this and the original were great as well. The graphics blew me away, considering it is coming from the Gamecube. The sound is great and the music is perfect. Everything comes together smoothly and creates one of the scariest and best games I\\'ve ever played. The only flaw I saw was the controls. The controls do retain the stationary camera scheme and the controls do take getting used too. As a Resident Evil fan though, the controls didn\\'t bother me, and instead gave me a feeling of deja vu from my days on the original game. I do sympathize though with people who do criticize the controls, because I too think it is time to move on to a better control scheme with moving and shooting. I rarely give a 10 in my reviews, but I will not hesitate with this game. This game definitely deserves a 10 and Capcom has proven that remakes are not always a bad idea.WOW thanks Ryan that sure is kind of you to speak so highly of me but everyone knows your the best at the game. Quit trying to make me feel good. Anyway this game kicks is the best. Great graphics great sound and a big improvement over the original. I love this game. Thanks again ryan!This game is THE SH*T!!!That loser that gave the game a one, I bet the game kicked his ass. I bet he sucks at videogames so bad that the game kicked him were it herts. What a dum ass. The game has the sweetest graphics of the year. That guy really made me mad. But the game is sweet. I love it.This is one of the best games on the gamecube. The game is incredibly atmosphereic and occasionaly frightening at times thanks to some of the best graphics on the gamecube. The controls are cumbersome at first and its hard to aim when you are being attacked, but you will get used to them. I actually found that after I got used to them, I sort of liked the controls is a sick, masochistic kind of way.One of the finest and most terrifying experiences in computer game history. I have to build myself up before I play this, get myself in the zone. Fantastic, intriguing storyline and a brilliant revamping of the ol\\' haunted mansion deal. RE4 may have the pick up and play gameplay but because REmake is one of the most absorbing and horrifying 12 hours you\\'ll ever spend, this has the edge for me. Lisa Trevor still sends shivers down my spine.My favourite RE of all time. When I think upon the franchise called, \\'Resident Evil\\', I think about this particular remake. I got this when I was 12 years old, and I didnt enjoy it because it scared the absolute hell outta me, but now I\\'m 17. I bought a gamecube again just so I can relive the experience. I am now back in the mansion with all the hunters and I AM LOVIN\\' IT. Just like what a previous reviewer said below me, you have to relax and let the game engulf you.The overall ambiance of this game is astounding! Though the camera angles can get annoying sometimes, this game is definitely one of the best survival-horror titles I have EVER played. The plot, music and visual effects are some of the best I\\'ve ever seen on the GameCube.Best RE game, hands down. Excellent atmosphere, great visuals, tight controls. Kept me on the edge of my seat all the time, and still do reruns from time to time. Amazing, one of Capcom\\'s last great games.Resident Evil is a real non-linear, full of sharp and scary moments.Eta masterpiece. Plus many endings and punch atmosphere terror.Game one in a billion!Just played this game today. This is a true RE game, Not RE5-6. The fixed cameras which boosted the overall atmosphere. Moody and beautiful soundtrack. The infamous controls. Very limited items. The puzzles. Zombies that could turn into crimson heads if you didn\\'t burned them/decapitate them or blew out their knee caps. Increased random Zombie encouters on harder difficulties. Real Survival & Invincible enemies. This was i.m.o. the best Resident Evil. Resident Evil devs today must buy a Gamecube with this game and Zero, play the crap out of it and then make a new RE game. We want to go through hell again! At least I want to after DS2 Hard Core difficulty :DRebirth resident evil  -super riddle and graphics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Best resident evil from all !!!!!!Must buy all fans on GAMECUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Reviewers should play games more before reviewing. I\\'ve played games for 20 yrs & a lot of \"professional reviewers\" either have no skills or give me the impression that they don\\'t even like video games.\\n\\nWhen it comes to games on the Gamecube & during that generation, this game offers a very interactive experience over more \"movie\" like games of today like Tomb Raider on PS3. Compared to even a lot of the story based RPGs on the system it pulls you in.\\n\\nThe graphic presentation isn\\'t really what makes the game. It\\'s the creepy mansion setting and layout that has made this game an instant classic when it first came out and what makes it still a memorable experience today.\\n\\nI\\'m playing this game in 2014 and looking at it from a modern interpretation of video gaming & this game really is an entertaining game. Though on paper it\\'s a fairly simple system of combat, item collecting, & map memorization, each aspect doesn\\'t ask you to do more than needed so the controls never feel limiting except for one...\\n\\nIn this game you cannot leave an item or pick up an item if your inventory is full. People say play Jill because she has 2 extra inventory spaces. This is horrible until you find the storage chests in the various rooms. In the beginning it will be annoying but later on it does mean some backtracking but load times are quick & the mansion isn\\'t that big that you\\'ll dread going back and forth. This flaw though has a justifiable reason though so KEEP READING:\\n\\nIn RE Zero ( a top favorite of mine that was designed specifically for the gamecube) you can leave objects anywhere and come back later to pick them up & the game memorizes where you leave everything until you progress onto the next main area. In this RE the ZOMBIE POSITIONS are MEMORIZED BY THE GAME.\\n\\nWhy that is because in this new RE the zombies never die until you luck out and their head explodes while shooting them or you have to burn them with kerosine in your inventory!\\n\\nAll the zombies you kill eventually rise again but with more durability & the run & lunge fast at you!\\n\\nThe only hint to this is in a paper you have to read.\\n\\nIn fact most the game is like this. You have to utilize & master all the different systems in place like reading, examining up close your inventory, attacking with your knife, modifying your control scheme etc...\\n\\nThis is a very detailed game that provides a great sense of control & accomplishment once you get used to it. AND NO MATTER WHAT pro reviewers say these controls worked for people almost a decade ago when it was it first came out on the Playstation 1 and it\\'s not that difficult or clunky as some suggest & it would be a shame to miss the game based on that.\\n\\nMost reviewers talk about the looks and controls. I\\'m going to write that it\\'s much more than these... It\\'s about a classic game environment & atmosphere that\\'s still better than what you will find since it\\'s release. It\\'s also very challenging because you have to remember everything & it\\'s a great game to play with my girlfriend watching in a dark room as she helps me keep track.\\n\\nIt\\'s not perfect so I\\'m giving it a 9...  because I think though the developer\\'s focus on having the game memorizing the zombie positions and them resurrecting harder is definitely intense it does remove some sense of realism & common sense that our heroes should be able to leave things to pick up stuff that\\'s more important but despite this you get a game that has different difficulty levels, two playable characters to play through with & it\\'s a fairly long adventure.\\n\\nI keep this game in my top 30 list of must have Gamecube games & I honestly feel you should too, right next to RE4, RE Zero & Code VeronicaI am a huge fan of the old-school resident evil series (1-3) and this gaI really believe this game should be the benchmark and starndard for all horror games.  Even a simple zombie stalking the corridors would give you the chills as regardless of how much weapons you have available to you, you still feel so much underpowered and it has never been so good to feel that way in a game these days.  From start to finish i dreaded every corner I turned and every door I opened.  If you are the gamer that enjoyed Resident Evil 1 released in the 90\\'s then you are in for a shock.  All in all I would recommend this game to everyone who isn\\'t easily frightened and strongly hope this is the standard Capcom will reach to regarding the Resident Evil series life after Shinji Mikami.I am a huge fan of the old school resident evil series since from the beginning and i must say this remake puts the title to the top and shows what and how resident evil exactly is ...! and tells what we want from the CrapCom in the next survival horror puzzle triangleThis is one of the best games of the 6th generation. Amazing graphics, good controls and a big replay value.\\nIf you played RE from PS1 first and you decided to play  this remake go ahead. You will not regret it.It is the work of the works!The best remake in the history of games gamesOnly one word \"excellent. \"Just wicked.Truely... a masterpiece. sure you can run around and finish the game in about 5 or six hours or whatever... but if you take it slow... sit back, and experience, LIVE resident evil you will enjoy the game so much more!! let all the creepy sounds and shadows get to you a bit... You will not go wrong with resident evil gc!!The games graphics are the best on any console, period. There is 70-80% new areas, puzzles, redone area\\'s, monsters, etc. The cut scenes are in real-time and look better than the PSone versions FMV scenes. And as for the same old control style, there is a reason. The controls make it harder to move around, and escape zombies. This makes the game that much more challenging and heart pounding! A must have for any GCN owner. Should tide you over until Eternal Darkness: Sanity\\'s Requiem is released!The best resident evil out there at the moment, zero is no comparison. This game is quite possibly the best one ever created.Old but still one of the best games ever.This is the scariest game I have ever played... Period! I never played any of the PSone versions, but who cares. One of the 10 best games of all time in my opinion.You can\\'t go wrong with this title. It\\'s got everything a \"survival-horror\" lover could ever want. The graphics are the icing on the cake, but this \"REmake\" retains all of the glory of the original (and best) Resident Evil release thus far. As a big fan of the earlier titles, none too pleased with the overrated and boring mess that was Resident Evil 4, I can assure you that if you feel the same way, this is the game to buy if you\\'re still hunting for a REAL Resident Evil title on your GameCube.Its the better than every game in the world put together the graphics are sweet the part when the dogs jump out of the window gives you a heart attack nearly best played inthe dark on your own.BRILLIANT! Great graphics and heart-stopping horror!Second ONLY to Eternal Darkness.The first one scared me absoloutly sh**less. But the re-released version is 10 times scarier. The graphics, gameplay and atmosphere are all even better. It really is one of the top five games I have ever playd. Buy it!!!!!!A great remake to a great game! Good graphics was that which made the old RE\\'s less scary and somewhat unplayable. It\\'s sad to know that RE 2 and 3 won\\'t be remade as well.This games is really hard at first it rocks thow i suggest this game for hard core fans!!!Xengamers = Ass.This game stinks. Actually I just stink at it. I played it for about 23 hours! But I can\\'t beat it, I\\'m probably only about half way through it! But I am getting help from my friend Austin who has beat it sveral times with each charactor, he\\'s really good, Well anyway, its a good game..... if you are good at it (like Austin), but if you are like me and you stink at it then you probly want to look somewhere else because it is very hard.This game was so good the effects cant get any greater and the gameplay is amazing it had me on the edge of my seet the whole time i played.It just simply kicks @$$ there where a couple of parts in the middle of the night where i nearly crapped myself. PS. if u lean down to light one unfire if its not dead u will find out and the those dam one that dissapear come back and scare the crap out of u so watch ur back.Being a girl I enjoyed playing as jill in this horror game. this is the best way to get u scared so bad that u might have an accident.This game was AMAZING. I love the game, and I think Rebecca and Chris are wicked. And for all your CG owners, get off your couch and buy this game! Wicked game. Just....absolutely wicked. I played the game a few times, and got Chris in another costume, along with Rebecca with her alternate costume. So, enjoy the game everyone!I löve Resident Evil! One of the best games ever created and now with the best graphics!This game is one of the best games of all time it deserves 10 simply awesome game one of the best games ever made. resident evil is the best.Upon playing nearly every survival horror game out there, I\\'ve decided that this one is, hands down, the best...period.One of the best games the GameCube has to offer. The graphics are nothing short of AMAZING. Prerendered backgrounds all look lush and full of detail, with fantastic lighting. The character models are nothing short of superb, and the zombies look terrific. Gameplay is what you would normally expect out of Resident Evil, but with a few new features, such as the defensive items and the new \\'crimson head\\' zombies. There are also quite a few new areas for you to explore in this remake. The controls almost feel like they were MEANT for the GameCube\\'s controller, although people will still have their complaints of the \\'tank-like controls\\'. The sound is nothing short of amazing, also. All in all, this is one of the greatest games done even better than it was, and its a joy to play through, with great replay value. A must-have for any Resident Evil fan.Ugh, the inverted controls, camera angles and limited ammo were pants, but after 30 minutes of play you found yourself immersed in a fantastic remake of a landmark survval horror game, far more chilling and panic-inducing than it\\'s sequels.The controls are done as they are on purpose. For one thing, the game uses a prerendered background, therefore the camera must be set. You can\\'t praise the graphics but put down the controls and camera because of this. Secondly, the controls add to the atmosphere. The creators of the game will tell you that they are like they are to be suspenseful. If you God of War style controls, then zombies would be REALLY easy to avoid, and the game would be boring. It\\'s about the ATMOSPHERE people!I loved this game and was one of the most compelling reasons to buy a Gamecube and if you own a Wii now you should try this game out. The graphics aged well because at the time they were simply incredible.I love how they redid resident evil 1 but, I felt like the game was a real challenge wear the zombies come back to life if you didn\\'t head shot them or burn them on fire. Also trying to find ammo was very difficult but, overall i loved the game and the whole resident evil story. Resident evil 5 is a joke. Love most resident evil games obviously :PAmazing remake. Has the 180 turn, lightning effects, redesigned cutscenes/.graphics. Okay, the bad voice acting was what made RE1 good but revamped it\\'s just better. Literally, as a GC exclusive it\\'s owrth getting one just for this game. I have played all of the other Resident Evils and this is definitely the best. JillBy today\\'s standards this is by far not a perfect game... the controls need getting used to... the writing is sometimes worse than in old Norris movies... but this is an oldy in trendy clothes... and despite all of its archaic shortcomings this is a great game - if you like the Resident Evil games, that is. After playing only Resident Evil 5 I really wanted to expierience the older games, the origins... and I got what I wanted. This is of course a completly diffrent expierience than the newer games. It is more about building a suspensefull atmosphere, where even one random zombie encounter could be your last. The music supports this almost on every occasion (the exeption is the horrible shark fight score)!The biggest issue I had, was the terrible inventory... not enough slots... which cqused endless needless backtracking, the same is to say about saving the game... those limited saves are a real pain. But in the end you get an interesting and suspensfull origins story on characters you care... couse if you don\\'t care for them... move along... this might not be the right game for you.The game carries the classic formula to almost photorealism levels.Not only is it beautiful, but it has one of the best settings, camera situation and details that have been seen in a terror game of any generation (including PS3-360).Re is the farewell of a game style that lived its splendor in the first PS1 and that is also one of the best horror games made at any time.This along side RE4 are the ultimate Resident Evil games with Resident Evil 2 not to far behind. This full on Remake updates everything from the original, whilst adding tons of new features and areas. The results is that REmake improves over the original in every single way. Amazing visuals and updated acting/cutscenes. This game is a classic within a classic.A masterpiece.  When I think of Resident Evil, this is the game I think of.  The epitome of Resident Evil.  This game is still masterful today and one of the best if not the best survival horror game.  I daydream about this game so much.  One of the best experience ever that will stick with you for a lifetime.This game, even by todays standards, is still amazing.  The graphics are still some of the best i have ever seen and the over scare factor is great.  This isnt just a remake, its a reimagining.  There are so many differences to the original, and so much added in.  The game is just great.  You have to burn zombies or decap them or they\\'ll come back as crimson heads and they are tough.  The new defensive items are a big help to escape getting hurt and the game is still just so good looking its impressive.  Why cant they make all games look like this?  The atmosphere is fantastic and the controls ( though most people dont like them) are great because thats how this game is meant to be played.  I really suggest this game to anyone whos a fan of survival horror just cause of how great it really is.One of my personal favorites. Its a simple but engaging story filled with choices and goals that could change the fate and outcome of the characters( to my knowledge this is the ONLY RE game that does this). If you like the tank controls and classic camera angles then you\\'ll like the game play. I\\'ve played most RE games but this one is no doubt the scariest. This game is tough, but its compelling and truly makes you feel the need to survive. And finally, the graphics....they are stylized beautifully. They truly make the game atmospheric and creepy and they are what EVERY horror game should look like.\\n\\nThis game is fantastic, if you like horror, you must play it.A fantastic remake. To be honest, I think this is better than the original in every regard, graphics, voice acting, combat, atmosphere, etc. pretty much everything. Most importantly it generally stays true to the original, with few minor alteration. New elements are just an improvement. The Zombie shark is just AWESOME!! Overall: Just utterly brilliant. I love this game, I wish all remakes would be given this kind of care and attention.Best remake ever.  All of the additions are of essence. Graphics hold up really nice even today (11 years after release). Brings back all of the chills of the original and even adds a really great sidestory.\\n\\nControls feel clunky these days and the voice acting is from a B movie (although better than the original). Still best in the series... probably.This is by far one of the scariest games that i have ever played. When i bought it i was expecting nothing was going to be change just a graphics boost but boy i was wrong (well some things were sort of the same from my previous play through on the PS1) there were some new puzzles which i liked and new zombies which scare the crap out of me this game. To make the review short i would recommend this title to any horror fan out there give it a shot. :)This is one of my favorite games of all time. The atmosphere is so great, and it terrified me as a child. The characters are truly dynamic but cliche at the same time. I like that they give Jill lots of extra skills to make up for her lesser strength and stamina. Also, the puzzles were so challenging the first time I played it, but it just made the game that much more enjoyable once I actually figured out the gist of all the puzzles.A masterpiece. Probably the best survival horror game ever made.The ultimate horror game. Silent Hill 2 was for years my favorite survival horror game, until this game showed and schooled every developer on how to do a survival horror.\\n\\nThe game makes you feel vulnerable: you are slower than some (many) of your enemies, your ammo is scarce, you cannot move or jump like Rambo, you have a very limited supply of healing items and (the first time at least) you have no idea what is behind each corner.\\n\\nYou will find yourself returning to this game over and over again, and not only because of the nostalgic factor, but because of the quality it has even for today standards.Legendary survival horror game that has changed an era, defined a genre, and driven the dazzling world success of PlayStation in the 90s. This was Resident Evil, and even if I had not ever finished it, I knew it very well. Searching on the Internet I learned about this version for the GameCube, and when I got the Dolphin emulator, it was one of the first games that I played with it. Many said it was better than the original version: they were right.\\n\\nDespite being one of the first games for PlayStation (the plot is identical on GameCube) it must be said that the plot of Resident Evil was definitely structured and deep. It was probably one of the first games to explore issues like the corporations that exploit people, to lie, to follow inhuman experiment, to kill and manipulate public opinion. It is a context that works very well, and where The Mansion plays a key role with its setting simply fantastic: dark, scary, full of traps and secrets. The plot really gives the feeling of being plunged into a nightmare.\\n\\nThe gameplay of Resident Evil is the definitive horror gameplay: hard, ruthless, funny, complex, never boring and terrifying. I\\'m definitely not one of the best players of this game, and unfortunately I played Resident Evil 0 (because the plot is set before) that was easier and I took this chapter lightly. And I was seriously wrong. The gameplay of Resident Evil goes beyond the normal games, and its difficulty is remarkable: ammunition, weapons, shots fired, medical herbs, number of enemies, unforeseen events; resources are only a few and you have to plan your moves and the use of the inventory, but at the same time you have to know that plan could be in vain, because the game is unpredictable. The pace and atmosphere of the game are perfect: there are jump scare, but they don\\'t really matter. What matters is the tension, the rhythm, the way the game forces you to feel overwhelmed, worried, scared of the unknown. The puzzles in the game are beautiful, they have consistency, they aren\\'t impossible but simply require a good deal of reasoning, and I was never bored and they don\\'t gave me too much difficulty. In addition, the GameCube version adds to the gameplay also new enemies as Crimson Head; when zombies are killed, the virus inside them changes and transforms them into even stronger and aggressive creatures. The only way to prevent this is to blow zombie\\'s head off, or set their corpse on fire before they transform, using lighter and kerosene. This greatly complicates the gameplay: you have to go back and forth throughout the Mansion, sometimes you don\\'t have enough kerosene, sometimes zombies transform too quickly, sometimes Crimson Head is pretending to be dead until the player doesn\\'t come close, and the monster takes him by surprise. This makes the game scary but fun and challenging. But I wasn\\'t ready for all this. My first round with the game failed, I exhausted ammunitions and herbs, I didn\\'t know how to deal with the Crimson Head, and I couldn\\'t continue. So I had to start again, and this time (still with some difficulty) I managed to play it for real. This is Resident Evil: a game that punishes the naivety and ignorance, but at the same time leaves you the desire to start over, to try again. And that\\'s why I fell in love with the game. And thanks to this perfect gameplay, I can say it exceeded the original game on PlayStation.\\n\\nFrom a technical point of view, Resident Evil on GameCube, was definitely one of the best graphics of its time, considering it came out way back in 2002. There were not many games that could stand up to it, graphically. Once I even noticed that the mouth of the zombies leaks vaporous burr. Simply absurd. The soundtrack is great, it fits perfectly the horror context. With the Dolphin emulator the game did not give me many problems, it flowed quite fluid, maybe there were just a few graphic glitches but nothing serious.\\n\\nSo, in the end, Resident Evil is the true survival horror game. It offers a high level of challenge, fear, atmosphere, a perfectly balanced pace. It requires patience and effort, but it pays off. It could be called the greatest survival horror game of all time. Definitely one of the best.This is, in my opinion, a shining example of a remake done right. It stays almost completely parallel to the original except with updated graphics, cinematics, and voice acting. None more was really needed, as the original resident evil\\'s core was just fine and didn\\'t need to change... with the exception of the bad gameplay mechanics.Wow, a 5 year old game redone....brilliant!Ok, so I started playing the game as Chris at about 3:30 a.m. to scare the crap out of myself and found the control system to be hugely counterintuitive (not a RE veteran, obviously). I also realized that survival horror is much more adventure-oriented than action, which is fine, but not really my cup of tea. The mansion is absolutely beautiful, and the music is perfect. I soon made the switch to the chick after I read that she\\'s easier (to play as, that is....). And I realized that trying to confront & kill every zombie & mutant dog is an exercise in futility. So I\\'m on my way. Definitely a good time if played in the DARK, late night. I\\'m trying to resist the urge to go for the walkthrough.....Looks great. Controls BLOW! Maybe I wouldn\\'t be so harsh if I hadn\\'t just played Eternal Darkness.It\\'s sh.t.I am mainly a first-person shooter fan. I decided to purchase a used copy of Resident Evil hoping to jump into a new genre of videogames. I made RE my choice because of the outstanding graphics and the interesting puzzle-solving gameplay. I have to admit, it has the best graphics of any Gamecube game, thus far. However, once I started playing it, I realized how boring it was not being able to see the action take place in first-person. I also found it frustrating because of the fixed cameras and not being able to see where the character is going. I believe that the game is not creepy at all, like many critics have said. Maybe if it was in first-person I\\'d be able to feel the creepiness better. I have come to a conclusion. I didn\\'t like third-person games on previous consoles, and I still don\\'t like them. I don\\'t know, call me a die-hard FPS fan, I guess. If I was a 3rd-person fan, I would most likely give this game the 10 it deserves, but obviously I\\'m not a 3rd-person fan.Pros: Graphics are extraordinary, with gorgeous prerendered backgrounds and immensely detailed 3D characters. The atmosphere is palpable. -- Cons: The controls are awful, horrible, detestable. They may have been OK for the original Resident Evil, but the world has moved on since then, and frankly I expect to have more control over my gameworld avatar when he/she\\'s being attacked by zombies and rabid dogs. And as you know, any game lives or dies by its controls. The gameplay (when you\\'re not frantically battling against the stupid controls in order to defend yourself against zombie attack) is tedious in the extreme, consisting basically of wandering around the mansion until you figure out (without any noticeable clues) what you\\'re supposed to do next. As much as I wanted to like this game, after a while I just could not summon up the will to continue. Not worth the effort unless you loved the original. (And for the record, I never played the original.)Woah. I played through RE4 and was stunned and amazed. I played this one and saw...that Capcom truly did revolutionize their series. The camera angles and horrible controls here are so bad I couldn\\'t play for more than ten minutes without shaking my head in disgust and going back to RE4. The graphics may be some of the best on the GameCube, but the controls are seriously bad, especially in the light of RE4. Seriously. Pressing up to go forward, regardless of the direction you\\'re facing is atrocious. Forget this game, I\\'m going to go play RE4 right now.Played the first RE, loved it. Played the second, loved it. Played #4 and loved it. Now, I can\\'t bring myself to sit down with this one for any real ammount of time. Why? Because it uses a cumbersome control system and poor camera angles. Combine that with the tough (HP wise) monsters and you have a bit of a frustrating time ahead of you. The maps have been changed significantly, but the addition of \"Red\" zombies and lack of improvements to gameplay make me reticent to suggest the acquisition of this particular offering. I suggest rental before purchase.With its slow paced gameplay and fixed camera angles Resident Evil was a truly scary survival horror title and this is a superb update of the PSone original that improves the graphics and adds in a few extra elements as well. Of course the flaws, such as the clunky controls and terrible voice acting are still present but even today this is a game still worth playing.And the fixed controls and camera are unjustable, at least the music and decent are horrible.This game isn\\'t for the new generations and ist getting old, the mechanic and the cam are so wrongOne of the best remake in the history of video games.Take all the good that the original game had, it improves it and also expands the plot with the story of Lisa Trevor.It is a 2002 game that can be played perfectly in 2021 and still looks like a masterpiece.It has two different campaigns (Jill and Chris), each with their playable differences, which are enough to give it great rejugability.It is survival horror par excellence.Approximate duration: 12 hours if it\\'s your first gameOf course this game deserves a 10, any R.E. fan would rate it at that. I know some people prefer different types of games and this may not suit anybody, but just look at it!Excellent Graphics, Superb Sounds and mood music,excellent gameplay and one-of-a-kind storyline, no-one could match the brilliance of this game. (except of course, Capcom)Another thing, it has to be the scariest game I have ever played, and that\\'s just Playing as Jill,the sounds of the creatures stirring in a room, out of view due to the excellent position the cameras are placed to create the ultimate amount of tension were enough to make me almost have an accident, especially the \"jump\"moments where creatures jumped out from places that you didn\\'t expect.I could go on and on about how this game kicks other games asses but I think I\\'ll have to go and oogle over Jill in her military costume some more.Chris D. u aint got a clue. How can a game as brilliant as resident evil in looks, gameplay and just about everything be a 1.Great Effects, Great Story, Just GREAT!!Can\\'t get better than this...Hands on, this game (i\\'m sad to say) looks better than xbox and is the only game to ever make me jump, it felt my heart race as i tried to kill a zombie that just came back.This game really scared the crap out of me, I LOVED it, the details were unbelievable!!! This is one game you should have!!!Talk about a challenging game!!! What I love about this game is that it scares the freaking hell out of me everytime I play it!!! I seriously reccommend this game for anyone who own a Nintendo Gamecube (GC)!!!!!!!TERRORIFIC, EXCELLENT, IT\\'S THE REAL DESCRIPTION.This game is amazing. i have played re games, and was never really that scared, but this one just blew me away. its beautiful graphics and great story make a perfect combination, but thats only half of it. its the suspense that really sucks you in. its not like there are 10 zombies in every room and things are popping out everywhere. they get you when you least expect it, and they dont take every oppurtunity to scare you. instead of that they make you scared of what could be around every corner, and that is way better than having monsters everywhere. the only downside is that sometimes it just seems impossibly hard and you kind of get pissed, but for the most part i was sucked in and my heart was pounding out of my chest. a must have for gamecube.This is one scary game. The graphics are some of the best ive seen on any consol. although the environments can look a bit static at times they are still really good looking. especially the outside areas. as for the camera angles and controls i dont have a problem with either. by not bein able to see a zombie through a certain camera angle the tension goes up. yeah as for \\'xengamers\\'\\' no one has heard or wants to hear of u so stop giving great games like this rubbish scores. u are the rubbish.The Gamecube Resident Evil remake is one of the great success stories in videogaming. This game was created afresh, from the bare structure of the original game, as an AAA experience. It is so good that Metroid Prime has continued to have serious competition as to which is the best Gamecube game (sorry The Wind Waker, you have quite a few flaws in my book). Resident Evil shares some similarities to Metroid Prime- - both start off relatively quietly (well, after MP\\'s short first level). Both have areas that need to be opened by solving puzzles/obtaining items. Both have calm areas (eg the save points) and very tense areas, which is emphasised by very different music throughout. Both have big bosses. Both have rooms that do not need to be entered to finish the game but may contain great extras. Both have maze-like maps. The lighting and fire effects in this remake are only rivalled on the Gamecube by Luigi\\'s Mansion (a game that is a bit like a child\\'s introduction to the mechanics of Resident Evil). Entering each room is sometimes a bit like gazing upon an Old Master, full of rich detail and nuance. Moths buzz around a lampost outside the mansion. The central staircase has gleaming polished wood. This elegant environment is slowly found to be torn by furious zombies and merciless Hunters. Part of the charm of this game is that, at some point you will find a trapdoor or an entrance outide leading to some entirely different aspect of the game. You will stumble upon all the trappings of a 1950s science fiction B-Movie, except lavished with all care and attention of a main movie. To me, this game is more timeless than Resident Evil 4. The remake\\'s character models, cut scenes, voice acting and general attention to detail are superior . RE4 is a broader, more gore and action filled game that concentrates on quickly getting you from A to B, wthout ever going back to A or B, and without giving you much of interest to stop for.. The remake is an inherently classier game that tells a story in time honoured tradition and lets you soak in its gothic horror atmosphere. Sadly, it seems that RE5 will conitnue to neglect the puzzle solving aspect that was found in the remake. By RE6 the time will come for reinvention and I hope that it will involve returning to the more detail-driven, house-based nature of the earlier games.This is the only game that will actually make you jump straight out of your seat! It is incredibly scary and I recommend it to anyone.Wow, I have only 1 time ever bought a gaming system for 1 title...Until now..again. RE remake maybe a REMAKE of a 5 year old game, but with the leaps and bounds in the storyline, camera angles, graphics (I never thought pre-rendered environments could look so stunning) & the game itself it\\'s like an entirly new game.Not enough good things can and will be said about this rare gem in video game history. props to capcom again on the emvironments, can\\'t wait for the fully 3-d backgrounds said to be on RE4.This game is not only scary while you play it, but i found that it stays with you after you\\'ve shut off your system. I hadn\\'t played any of the PSone versions of Resident Evil with sh.tty graphics, so the game was all-new to me. It was an awesome game experience, like seeing a really good and scary movie!I have buyed the gamecube just for this game, this is simply a masterpiece, the best classic RE for me, it deserves an 11 or 12Though the game has been around for years I\\'ve never taken interest in Resident Evil until recently. I got the game for dirt cheap and was surprised how good it is. I saw my cousin play the old Playstation version years ago and was unimpressed but for the Gamecube the graphics have been re-rendered to absolute lifelike perfection. The shadows, the sound, the ambiance and those thunderclaps...all highly, highly realistic. Play this with your Gamecube hooked up to your home theatre. And like me, you\\'ll totally jump out of your skin at the scary parts (many of them).\\n\\nMy main hint is conserve your ammo. If you see a zombie, put it down right away (no funny stuff) and burn it. Take care of them one at a time. And if you don\\'t burn them they will soon come back as Crimson Heads-faster, deadlier, scarier.\\n\\nMuch like the Myst series, Resident Evil is one of those games where you have to keep your eyes and ears open. Clues and puzzle pieces are scattered all over the place and you need to pay attention.\\n\\nDon\\'t be put off by the size of the mansion. After a short while it\\'s easy to get your bearing and find your way through rather easily. Though I will be honest with the fact I did not understand most of the story. I have no idea what Trevor\\'s diary from 1968 had to do with the plot and I really didn\\'t get why Umbrella would create the T-Virus. I know there are various ways to finish and complete the game though. Especially seeing as how there are many clips during the end credits that did not happen in my game play (I did it in just over 8 hours). If you finish it in certain time frames the next one is always different somehow. I only managed to unlock a new outfit for Chris. Wow!\\n\\nMy only gripe is about those boring \\'door opening\\' cut scenes. They really got on my nerves. Still, it\\'s a chilling game that will freak you out if you play alone in the dark. Well worth the time and money.The story of the wonderful meaning of the word and the way to play For examples of the most beautiful games Resident Evil We have events and scenario of the events of the game to reduce the fun with time and raise a difficult levelThe remake of Resident Evil 1 is undoubtedly the greatest game of the entire Resident Evil franchise, and for me personally, it\\'s my joint-favourite game of all time. This truly is the peak of horror gaming. Everything is seriously flawless, and so well thought out, and so exciting to play. The atmosphere of the game is absolutely haunting, and that makes it so incredibly memorable. Despite the game being old, it\\'s so brilliant that I still want to replay the game over and over and over. I could rant all day about how perfect this game is, and how much I adore it, but the best way to find out its greatness is to play it yourself. Resident Evil 1 is truly a masterpiece, and truly a work of art.Magnificent.A \"Survival Horror\" classic perfected to become a masterpiece: terrifying, enveloping, challenging.The story and the characters are little complex, true, but sufficiently consistent to keep you interested in moving forward and does not ruin the experience of terror.Certainly the best episode of the franchise.\\nAny fan of survivor horror must play this masterpiece.\\nThe best to this day.\\nNo need to play exactly this version, it may be the Remastered version that is exactly the same, but with melhroes graphicsI place it at the same level as episode 0 because I played there just after (and I liked it was the scriptwriting continuity).The advantage of this is the chests, to store objects.\\nBut the story takes me less at the guts, the characters\\' past is less \"worked\" (unlike 0 with Billy).Be careful, it remains very interesting, and the atmosphere is at the same level as the 0 (superb).^^\\n\\nTwo equivalent games in the end for me.A very good resident Evil, a classic.;)Capsom just took and showed in 2002 how to do real remake of games on the example of Resident evil remastered. Originally the game was released in 1996 at PlayStation and after 6 years left for the 2001 console from Nintendo-Gamecube. As stated by the developers of the original game was only 35% and they did not lie, if you have already played in the original, then you still need to play in RemakeA masterful remake of a classic. It stayed true to the original RE while adding new rooms, bosses, weapons, dialogue and voice acting. Graphically, it pushed the GameCube in the same way that Splinter Cell took advantage of the Xbox\\'s capabilities. This is even better than original PlayStation game from \\'96. I would rate this with a 9.2 out of 10.This game was great. It was made in a way where it adds new scary enemies. Enemies such as the crimson head zombies and Lisa Trevor. It added new things while not being too far from the original in a great balance. Best remake video game when it came out and maybe even to this day.Gloomy, oppressive, challenging and imposing.A survival horror that produces first of all satisfaction.Satisfaction when unraveling details of the script that are gradually dosing in a suspense plot where you never know what waiting for the corner.Satisfaction when solving a puzzle, handling the inventory and using backtraking.Satisfaction when leaving airy after being in tension in a confrontation or when fleeing a monster that pursues you.In short, satisfaction to finish an unforgettable game.Surely the best delivery of the saga, despite having 18 years old continues to impress at the visual level and this is better checked in the remastered version that came out a few years ago, and is still a fun game.10/10.An instant classic in the resident evil series. Best game of the franchise together with resident evil 4.',\n",
       " 'One of the best survival horror games of all time. (seventy-five characters)Best game of the original trilogy, it totally perfects every aspect of the previous two games.Out of the original trilogy RE3 is my favorite. This game still holds up imo if your into the classic style Resident Evil games.Awesome game dude I love it so much its really amazing and it\\'s really cool well done wowIt is baffling to me that no one talks about this game anymore... mention resident evil 3, and people automatically think you\\'re talking about the remake, which people think is the only version of the game to exist. Say what you will about the new game, but when I was growing up in the 2000\\'s, no matter who you were, when any one said \"Resident Evil\" people immediately thought of two things.\\n\\nJill Valentine, and Nemesis.\\n\\nThese two are, without a doubt, one of THE MOST iconic pair in horror video gaming history. People who don\\'t play video games know who these two are, even if they don\\'t know their names, THATS how well known they are.\\n\\nWhen the remake came out last year, people took the opportunity to say just how BAD of a game the original Resident Evil 3 Nemesis was. The people who\\'ve said this have never played the game, and it\\'s very obvious.\\n\\nBecause you know what? I played this game for the first time just this last month.\\n\\nIt has become my all time favorite Resident Evil Game.\\n\\nTank controls are something to get used to, but when you do get use to them, you barely notice it.\\n\\nDodging enemies is also very satisfying to pull off.\\n\\nI think it is literally one of the greatest horror games ever. It is that good to me. Yes, I\\'ve played RE2 and 1, and honestly this one is much more fun. Don\\'t get me wrong, they\\'re all good games, I enjoyed 1 and 2 very much, but 3 is like that game that transcends the series to me. You don\\'t need to know Resident Evil to know who Jill and Nemesis are to each other, they\\'re like David and Goliath. And it is a damn shame how they were handled in the remake.Excellent game, a survival horror classic and having one of the most legendary monsters of Resident Evil and video games.RE3: Nemesis takes place before, during, and after the events of RE2. Running for your life as soon as you heard the foot steps was a great adrenaline rush. Hearing \"STARSSS\", coming from one side of the wall or alley already had you panicking but what a memorable experience it was.… ExpandI just played this on original PlayStation for the first time after playing RE2 on PS1 also for the first time. It’s not quite as good as RE2 (which I rate a 9/10 game) in that it’s a little shorter and the enemy Nemesis can be irritating at times. I don’t mind tank controls, however, the sluggish nature of moving around a fast paced enemy doesn’t work quite well. You’ll find yourself dying on Hard mode simply because your character doesn’t turn left or right as quickly as you need them to.The environments look great and there’s much of the vibe from RE2 carried over. The puzzles are decent too.I had to laugh at times when Carlos would keep running off for no reason but it usually meant something cool was around the corner.A minor complaint, similar to RE2, is that there are too many doors and gates to open. It might seem really trivial but when you’re moving back and forth around environments and you have to watch a door open for 5 seconds each time, it robs you of the feeling of agency.Another thing worth pointing out is that RE3 Nemesis was released in 1999, 1 to 2 years after some amazing games like Super Mario 64, Goldeneye 007 and Ocarina of Time. While a totally different genre, the 3D objects in the game (like the player character and enemies) really highlight the PS1’s age by 1999. It’s made up for by amazing pre-rendered backgrounds, though.I absolutely love survival horror and this game met my expectations but didn’t exceed them. I would’ve liked a longer adventure such as more buildings to explore and perhaps a few more sidekicks to meet along the way.Still very much a recommended title to play if you have original hardware with a dual shock controller.The game has a good amount of horror, loss, loneliness, and a struggle to survive. The characters of their performance are very excellent, and they have greater interaction and help me as well, and the puzzles are excellent. They are easy, good, and excellent original better  than remake i love this game… ExpandOne of the best resident eviL games ever made and one of the best survival horror games of all time and also one of the best ps1 games\\nthe Atmosphere of Raccoon city is unforgetableGegsgegdgdhdgdgdbdvdvdvbdbdbdgsbsbdbdbdbdbxvvdvdgdgdgdhdgsgsgdgsgsgsgdgdgdgdgdgdgTotally unmatched, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis is still to this day the best game of the original trilogy, it captures both action and horror in the best way possible and has a great replay value for the choice system like no other, its a shame that the remake totally failed to bring the same essence that this title gave us in the past.I like this game series. Definitely worth a try if you haven\\'t still tried it. The music is also good.The best part of the classic residents.Consides all the best ideas from them.For me personally, this game is important in that after its passage I began to be interested in the game industry, choose good games, and not buy everything in a row.Best re of all time, with very dynamic gameplay, confrontation with nemesis, and Jill Valentine.!!!',\n",
       " 'This is a review of a half complete Vanquish. The graphics, controls, combat cover system and level design is all top notch nothing more needs to be said, just buy the game and see for your self. There are several brilliant set pieces that are amazing and kind of similar to those in Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and Bayonetta. This may not be the best game this year (Red Dead Redemption, Enslaved, Mass Effect 2) but it is unique and more entertaining than playing Gears of War because the unrelenting action never lets up. I see this as a good thing though I\\'m sure some of you don\\'t.Mikami did it again. Incredible shooter: fast, furious, vibrating, crisp, smooth and beautiful. It is short? no, it is not. It just last what it has to without getting repetitive. A gem you can not let go if you like shooters and top notch quality action gaming.10This game might be over a year old now, but it\\'s a real gem. Third person shooting mechanics similar to Gears of War/Mass Effect, yet much more refined, making for swift easy transition between cover and strafing. Fun, powerful weapons and melee attacks makes each battle an absolute joy to take part in. The story is of course extremely corny and overblown (something about evil Russians capturing a space station shooting a laser beam and killing some Americans, so it\\'s time to fly up there and stop them from doing it again), but I honestly paid no attention to the story as I was too busy exploding robots! Graphically this game is beautiful and has extremely high production values. The sound and high tempo music is very fitting too. The controls are superb and put other \\'one-button-for every-action\\' games like Gears of War and Mass Effect to shame really. My time with Vaniquish was completely bug free too - everything did what it was supposed to and nothing every failed. Vanquish is also quite challenging in a fun way simply because it has checkpoints often and offers you a varied amount of weapons to tackle each situation. THE only real issues I have with the game are the overall length - took me about 8 hours to complete on hard, which is a little underwhelming. Also, the lack of multiplayer was a real shame too. This game definitely would have benefitted from a co-op/horde mode as the gameplay is superb and would led itself well to some multiplayer action. Also, however brilliant the game is at everything it does, it is a little unoriginal and I was never fascinated by the story or the setting. Luckily the gameplay is so good, that I mostly didn\\'t care. If you love fast paced action shooters with superb gameplay - look no further! It\\'s just a shame Vanquish 2 will probably never happen.THIS GAME IS JUST AMAZING!!! By far one of the most innovative games out this year, and one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. This game starts and never stops. It is a thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you want a new experience, then buy this awesome masterpiece... you WILL enjoy every minute of it!This is probably the best game I\\'ve played in a long time. The graphics are fantastic and the framerate is superb and smooth. Cover mechanics are extremely slick and work so well, you won\\'t find yourself accidentally diving out of cover into the firing line of enemies like many other third person shooters. The whole experience is just so extremely fast-paced and fluid. Weapons are varied enough for you to find one that suits your style, without providing too many choices to be overwhelming.I will definitely be playing through this again on a higher difficulty, and I have not bothered to do that in a game for a very long time! I think this is a definite must-play.The fourth title from the talented Platinum Games, creators of the excellent Bayonetta, Vanquish is a fast paced sci-fi shooter/action title that sees Sam Gideon tasked with reclaiming an orbital space station from Russian terrorists.\\n\\nThe stereotypical sci-fi plot is actually the games weakest element and is easily ignored for the most part in favour of the games fantastic action and unique twist on third-person shooting. Throughout the game Sam will find a number of weapons ranging from the standard machine guns and shotguns to more unusual weapons such as a lock-on laser. Although only three weapons can be carried at once the frequently found weapon crates allow the player to change their set often in order to adapt their tactics depending on the situation. A responsive cover system is also present and its use is vital to survival because Vanquish is a difficult game right from the outset. I died 49 times on my first play through despite the fact that Sam\\'s AR suit slows down time when the player is close to death in order to give them a chance to find shelter. One frustrating element to the combat is the one hit kill mechanic employed by some of the bosses. A visual and audio warning is usually given before they unleash these attacks but it is still irritating to get close to beating a difficult enemy only to make one mistake and be killed.\\n\\nWhat really helps to differentiate Vanquish however is the boosting mechanic. Sam\\'s suit is equipped with a set of boosters that allow him to slide around the battlefield and incredible speed. Boosting allows the player to keep themselves out of harms way but must be used sparingly as it quickly causes the suit to overheat.\\nA number of set pieces help to break up the combat and the player will find themselves battling on high speed trains or trying to escape a collapsing freeway during the games thirty or so missions.\\n\\nVanquish may not be a particularly long game, seven or eight hours is a standard sort of time, but thanks to its stat tracking and extra challenge modes there is plenty of replayablity making Vanquish a truly underrated action title that deserves a bigger audience that it has thus far received.well concieved, nice graphics (no framerate or tearing for that matter) and excellent gameplay and animation. Its a pity that the game ended so quickly without any multiplayer or co-op added. If it did I would\\'ve rated the game a perfect 10 out of 10 and recommend it too everyone one. But overall this game is the best Japanese shooter out there.Dear lord this game was so massively overlooked. It had the duck and cover fighting of Gears of War mixed with actual speed. The game gives you so many options and guns as to how you would like to approach the given situation. I promise if you try this game, you will NOT be disappointed. The only thing I can honestly knock this game over is the way in which you level up weapons. You find weapon drops that increase ammo, which is not uncommon for the genre. To level up a weapon, you must find these drops while having full ammo for the weapon, hence increasing the exp. However, all this really means is that in order to work up your favorite gun, you have to not use it. As bad as that sounds on paper though, it is overlooked by the other great things this game does. Get it. It\\'s like 10 bucks now!!Its too bad not enough people bought this game, they cant make a sequel from what i hear. That sucks, because Vanquish has got some of the best shooting mechanics of all time! The gameplay/shooting is like Gears of War, but WAY faster, and in my opinion better. The setting on a spacestation is pretty cool. The story is not so cool, but it does an ok job. But who cares the gameplay is so good. Hope this helps.OK, I know this game came out a year and a half ago but all I got to say is\"How did I miss it?\" . . . On a whim I picked it up at Fry\\'s the other day for $19.95 and i must say it\\'s the most bang-for-buck game I think I ever stumbled upon.  It\\'s a fantastic shooter with heart pounding action and huge robot boss fights.  Your character is fully developed out of the box, you are powerful, the different weapons you have to fight with are powerful and feel great.  Once you get used to the mechanics your maneuverability is smooth and essential to your survival.  My only complaint is that the story kind of ends abruptly, before you ever fight the really badass badguy, and there\\'s no indication of a sequel at the end either. Oh . . . but what a visual spectacle and really fun this shooter is!Vanquish\\'s rocket sliding is one of the greatest gameplay mechanics in any third person shooter. It makes the thrilling, fast paced gameplay even more thrilling and fast paced. The boss fights are excellent and some of the weapons are creative and feel great to use. If you like action games you\\'ll love Vanquish.Simply THE best action game I have ever played. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is fast and fluid, with a steep enough learning curve that by the end of the game, you feel like a 100% badass. The story is your usual throwaway Japanese style yarn, but it really is not detrimental to the game. Platinum have created a masterpiece here and it only fills me with sadness that we will probably never see a sequel due to mediocre sales.Awesome, though a bit \"i\\'ve seen this before\". Doesn\\'t matter how many hour you spend to complete it, you will be stuck to the couch and whishing that the next wave of enemies comes in. The storyline doesn\\'t kill, but it\\'s enough to keep the interest until the \"The End\" moment arrives. Gorgeous colorful-but-techie-looking graphics, a nice amount of different weapons to use, and looooooooots of enemies to destroy in such creative ways like using your boosters to pass under the bigger ones, then jump behind them and unloading a pack of ammo without blinking. Challenging enough to enjoy the ride. Great battles against the big bosses all over the course. A \"must have\" and now more than ever at the reduced price. Just a couple of things more: AWWWEEEEESOME Soundtrack and sound effects getting you in the middle of a really-what-the-frakk-is-this-chaos battles. Â¿A Con?. After all is kind of a high-tech remake of Gears of War. But, true story, i doesn\\'t matter at all.ENJOY!Vanquish is a Japanese game. Naturally, it is high in adrenaline and wants to fire as many missiles at you at the same time as possible.Also, as with many Japanese games, it is very silly (insert rocket boots joke here). Good dude bad dude storyline, mixed up with a twist which is more of a slow turn at the end.The basic premise is that a Russian bad guy (who seems to like the colours black and red a lot) decides to fire a microwave at San Francisco. Then you end up on a space ship with robots surrounding you trying to rip your face off. Did I miss something?The robots are great enemies, popping heads off is still somehow satisfying after just about every game with robots allows you to pop their heads off and there is some variation with walkers seen in Star Wars Battlefront 2, the silver surfer and Megatron from classic Transformers all taking part. Despite this, I feel as if they underplayed the variation, from the first mission I thought I\\'d face off hordes of unique robots, but I ended up with an occasional megatron and 95% of the enemies being the same standard model which got very boring fighting 3/4 of the way in.The game is excessively short, being at best 5 hours of campaign (an additional three thousand hours for cut-scenes) with no additional game modes - not even multiplayer. Its not even as if the campaign is highly replayable - it really isn\\'t which surprised me.Vanquish is not a bad game, it has lots going right for it, but the short campaign and monotony really don\\'t do much good for the 50 dollar price tag it had on release. Despite these shortcomings, I\\'m awaiting a Vanquish 2, where hopefully there will be some variation to break up the combat, a longer, less cinematic based campaign and hopefully a few new features such as maybe a hoard one to go up against the game\\'s major competitor, the ever present and huge \\'Gears of War\\' franchise.Hands down, VANQUISH was the most enjoyable gaming experience I\\'ve had thus far on the XBOX 360. Rather than rattle on about this and that, I\\'ll highlight the highs and lows. POSITIVES: epic soundtrack, fantastic visuals, engaging combat system, complex but intuitive layout/upgrade paths, solid voice acting, and more \"holy &#$#\" moments than any other game I\\'ve ever played. Ever. NEGATIVES: weapon upgrade system is completely inane (can be circumvented, however, by cleverly swapping out duplicate weapons before upgrading); moronic save system (dying, then restarting from a checkpoint punishes you by removing any accumulated weapon chevrons/upgrades, forcing you to exit to menu screen and reload via the save system unless you want to feel completely underpowered by the final levels); unfortunately incoherent conclusions story-wise--not only did I not understand what, exactly, happened... but I didn\\'t care, either. Up until that point, however, the story does serve its purpose and keeps the action moving along. Despite its shortcomings, VANQUISH is the type of game that will engross and consume you -- if you let it.DMC+ Gear of War on steroids.Totally bonkers.. The story leaves a little to be desired but the game play is so slick..  Nice graphics not alot of replay value.. this is worth checking out second hand..good game..an extraordinary game, full of frenetic action and speed. JapaneseÂ´s product and the clear signal that they too know how to do shooters up to the top.Great solid game.  Great fast paced gameplay in sci if world.If you\\'re looking for a badass, fast paced game with awesome gameplay and set-pieces, then this is the game for you. Vanquish has, without a doubt, the best mechanics and gameplay of any 3rd person shooter I\\'ve ever played. In no time, you find yourself sliding across the floor, shooting in slow motion at giant killer robots in space. The graphics and framerate of this game are excellent, which is shocking. In games like this, usually you\\'d expect the framerate to suffer. However, in Vanquish, it never once dips.\\n\\nPeople complain that the story of the game is weak. However, the issue with this argument is that the story isn\\'t important. The story is just enough so that you have an objective and context. That\\'s all it has to be.\\n\\nThe other common complaint with this game is that it\\'s too short. This is partially true. The game takes about 5 hours to beat. With that there are bonus missions to tackle, which adds some more length to the game. The game is short and sweet, which is far better than a longer and padded out game.\\n\\nAll in all, this game is definitely a must play. I\\'d recommend it to any action fan/3rd person shooter fan.The high -speed Rubilovo Russian robots, crazy dynamics in half with crazy Japanese.Suitable game.Vanquish is a unique and incredible third-person shooter by PlatinumGames.And when you see that name you know an insanely over the top game is coming.\\n\\nVanquish has you play as a guy with a suit allowing him to slow down time and boost around.The gunplay is great and some of the bosses are incredible.The suit makes the game\\'s great cover system underrated.The whole game is just polished as all f***\\n\\nThe framerate and graphics are great too.\\n\\nSound design and Soundtrack are OK.\\n\\nMy only real complaints are the poor story and the fact you can complete the game in 4 or 5 hours.Players control Sam Gideon, a DARPA agent armed with the Augmented Reaction Suit. If the player takes too much damage, the suit will automatically enter Augmented Reaction (AR) mode. AR mode increases Sam\\'s reflexes tenfold, essentially slowing down time for Sam to evade attacks. The player can also manually enter AR mode by holding down the aim button while evading, sliding, or vaulting over cover, allowing the player to target enemies (and their weak spots) easily.Incredible gameplay and good storyline but short and slightly varied. Overall it was a pretty good experience.Very good game, even for a completely new story game, great armor`s, enemy`s etc design, awesome functions in gameplayGame of the year, everything in this game is perfect, the gameplay is flawless,the graphics are amazing and the history is very good,well done platinum games keep up with the good work.nice game!!!!! this game is good the graphics are nice!!!! game of the year!! it is like lost planet and gears of war!!! but this is the best!!!!Simply the best shooter ever! Pure action and acrobatic mecha action, what a great experience, please make part 2! Perfect graphics and gameplay, shinji mikami masterpieceAfter the slightly disappointing ( in my opinion) Bayonetta, i wasn\\'t expecting much from PlatinumGames\\' new game Vanquish. when i got it, though, i was blown away!! everything i want in video games is here: slow motion shooting, big bosses, giant explosions and great graphics. also, one more thing, get out of your seat and go buy it!!! i got this for £4 as well.Better fun, gameplay and guns than Gears Of War, but way too short and no multiplayer holds this back from getting a top score. Worth waiting and buying when it comes down in price - pay about two-thirds of retail because this is two-thirds of a game. Big shame it didn\\'t go the full distance because it could have been a real belter.This is a fantastic game - for those who loved Bayonetta - this is another slice of gameplay perfection. Imagine Gears of War 2 with slightly more intuitive controls and a max payne slowdown.Game of the year, everything in this game is perfect, the gameplay is flawless,the graphics are amazing and the history is very good,well done platinum games keep up with the good work.Enter Vanquish, a game that takes the TPS genre and flips it on its head with craziness. You are Sam Gideon, a special DARPA agent in control of the Augmented Reaction Suit (known as ARS in game). San Francisco is destroyed by turning one of America\\'s space colony\\'s into a weapon of mass destruction. Russian Terrorists calling themselves the Russian Star are to blame for this despicable act. Sam is sent with a crew of Marine\\'s to find the one responsible and take him down.Now onto the meat of the package, the gameplay. Sam\\'s AR Suit is equipped with some neat abilities. One of the best of them being his ability to boost around the battlefield with thrusters that are attached to certain spots of his suit. This keeps the frantic and fast gameplay intact as you run from enemy\\'s to safer cover, or run in for a melee kill when the opportunity presents itself. Speaking of melee, that\\'s another interesting feature in the game. Instead of swatting at the robot forces with your gun, Sam decides it\\'s more effective to just give them a mean right hook and call it a day. I respect a man who punches a robot in the face, it shows character. This does have its drawbacks however, after you rock the jaw piece of an enemy, your suit will overheat, forcing you to take some cover and wait for the power to come back to the suit. I tended to use my melee attack in 1 on 1 situations, or if an enemy got to close to me. If you try to fly in, kill a foe, and then fly out, well you have another thing coming to you.Aside from that, there are a variety of different weapons you can pick up as you go about your mission. Though I normally kept my assault rifle handy, I always experimented with other weapons when possible, and it proves quite useful. Sure, you can get through the entire game just using an assault rifle, but it\\'s much more rewarding when you knock back a giant mech into a pit with your LFE gun, or dismember a giant mech with the Disk Cutter then give him a nice swift speed boosted kick across the map. The game rewards you for trying out different weapons, but in the end, you can get through the entire game with the assault rifle, though I wouldn\\'t recommend it as it would really kill the fun of the experience and the versatile weaponry.On top of all this, there\\'s also the AR mode, which is basically a super slow motion effect that helps you aim. Sure, this has been done all before, but I can\\'t help mentioning it considering it\\'s one of the suit\\'s most useful abilities. It really helps you line up those head shots, or go for weak points (which it also points out when you are in the AR mode). The gameplay is frantic, rewarding, and just down right fun. It can be repetitive if you want it to be, but for those looking to go into Vanquish and take all it has to offer, you\\'ll be often changing your weapons and tactics and finding out different ways to take out your foes.Not only is the gameplay great, but so are the graphics. Gone are the boring greys and browns that plague just about every single shooting game on the market, if not all of them. This game is full to the brim with whites, silvers, greens, and the occasional blue and red. Heck, there\\'s even a forest level. That\\'s right, with trees! If only the trunks of said trees weren\\'t brown, then there wouldn\\'t have been any brown in this game at all. On top of the amazing visuals, there is also the fluid animation and excellent designs of enemy\\'s and characters. Well, except for Lt. Col. Burns, he looks kind of stupid... but in a funny way that someone who can appreciate cheesy designs (like me) can enjoy. Also considering how quick the gameplay is, I never saw any slowdown.Last, but not least, the replay factor. The game\\'s single player campaign, on my first run, not specifically rushing through the game, on hard mode, took me about 6 and a half hours. Perhaps that sounds like a bad thing, but in my opinion it\\'s not. It welcomes you to play the game again, beat your high score, and go for a better time. It\\'s very old school in that sense, and I think it was deliberately built to be this way. I love quick games like this, because I can sit down and play them over and over again without having to worry about committing myself to it. Like a Mega Man game, I can sit down and beat it in an hour. I\\'m sure I\\'ll get this game down to 2 or 3 hours eventually, allowing it to happily be played again because of the fact that it\\'s short, and it\\'s competitive nature with scores, speed running, and leader boards will always have me returning to it. On top of that, there is Challenge Mode, which is basically a survival mode where you have to kill all the enemies in a small arena, and then you get a time after you complete it. If you\\'re into this sort of thing, you\\'ll certainly be going back to beat your time\\'s (or someone else\\'s for that matter). This game is just oozing with replay value, for a person who enjoys that.wow, this new title of the resident evil creator is awesome, and better than resident evil (for me), the gameplay, controls, graphics, all is fantastic in Vanquish.I love the system, high risk, high reward, great slick stylish action, zooming around on your knees with flames shooting out the back like Iron Man.  But - it\\'s just too short!  And there are not enough weapons.  Plus the melee system makes no sense to me.  You hit one enemy, and your own armour gets depleted?  Melee attacks in this game are not THAT powerful to warrant such a disadvantage.  It\\'s a shame because this really is the greated 3rd person shooter I have played.  So much fun, and it\\'s such a challenge.  It really punishes you!  Jumping out of cover to get that slow motion reward is brilliant.  If you sit around in cover all day, blind-firing or just popping up like you do in most games - you will die and you will be punished and made a fool of.  It\\'s refreshing to play a shooting game where you are actually supposed to be on your toes.  And actually it has amazing boss battles - something most games get completely wrong.  But these get your blood pumping and really are enjoyable!Story = 6\\nGameplay = 9\\nGraphics = 7\\nSounds = 7\\nPleasure = 9\\nAtmosphere = 7\\nDuration = 9Could have got much better score from me, probably even a GOTY award from me if it wouldn\\'t have some problems. Never saw annoying lags and bugs, great looking graphics, controls are good if not counting, that you can do evade move only in four dircetions. What problems in this game? Well, first of all, I completed this game on hard in 4 hours, giving you \\'\\' What? Did I already completed this game? \\'\\' feeling. Even though completing this game gives you a God Hard difficulty option, it doesn\\'t save you from the feeling. For second problem, the end section of the game. At the final sections of the game, you will face boss battles, repeatedly. Worst of all, boss enemies which you had faced before, you will need to fight againts them, again, again and again. It just gets annoying when almost every fight is againts bosses. Buy this only when it gets cheaper, other wise I recommend this game.Just go buy this game, seriously. It\\'s similar to Gears Of War... on ACID. Superb gameplay, excellent graphics. This is a total sleeper-hit and 100% worth your time.no replay value for this game,beat the solo mode in 4 hours, you buy it for just 4 hours of gameplay??.... nice!!no multiplayer mode make this a big fail!Well I suppose I deserved it. This was one of those games people buy because they wanna look hardcore on a game forum. The Japanese niche title like Godhand. And like Godhand this game sucks too. It is an obvious Gears of War rip off. The pluses are a great frame rate, fluid and fast combat, a slide that is useless, and a pretty environment. The bad is that environment is the only one on the game, the combat is boring, the bosses are all \"shoot the orange spot on the _____\" and the story is  barely passable.  Another thing is these lame Japanese games with these characters that are over the top. Its cheesy and awful and not in a good way. Also characters that smoke are not cool. Snake could not be cool so this pansy isn\\'t gonna be cool either.  There is a reason this was a $20 bargain bin game a month after it released. Mikami  has really lost his touch as of late. This game just had no reason to exist.  Sega wants to know why they are broke. Games like this Sega. Games like this. After the great Bayonetta, I expected more from Platinum Games.This is no doubt a good game. although there may be some minor flaws such as a bad plot, unimpressive weapons, and many battles that fit in with stay here and defend the area group. other than that it is a very enjoyable game.Vanquish is one of my favorite games of the past generation, the reason? The gameplay is really awesome, cool, funny, and intense; the graphics are fantastic, the level design is brilliant, but the only problem that I found on Vanquish is the replay value, and the game time; Vanquish is really short, but don\\'t care, because the big part of the game is fantastic.Vanquish\\ndon’t believe the hype\\nVanquish is a 7 hour long 3rd person shooter where you play as agent Sam with a sick augmented reaction suit.\\nRussia destroys San Francisco with a solar beam and demands the United States surrenders before they do the same to New York and you set out to stop this.\\nBefore you do play this game, I need to bring you back down to reality, because this is not some hidden gem classic that everyone on the internet makes it out to be…\\nDon’t get me wrong… Vanquish is a really fun game...\\nThe shooting feels great, you can slide around on the ground for slow motion shots or just move around maps faster…\\nAnd when you take too much damage the game will go into slow motion allowing you to find cover or have a better shot at taking out the enemy before you die\\nWhich makes for some pretty epic feeling gun play…\\nAnd the best part of this game is the guns and their upgrades…\\nThere’s a huge variety of weapons here to find what you like best...\\nYou can carry up to 3 weapons at a time plus grenades, and enemies will randomly drop upgrades that you can assigned to your favorite weapon to increase its stats instantly..\\nThe game doesn’t slow you down my making you go into some skill tree, no... You pick up an upgrade with your equipped gun and you’ve got an upgraded gun right then and there...\\nAnd even better if you pick a duplicate while your ammo on a certain gun is still full... you also instantly get an upgrade for that weapon…\\nThis system had my actively switching guns and holding out on more rare weapons just incase I could upgrade it on the fly…\\nupgrading all of the guns in the game while still making sure you have the ammo to get the job done is a meta game itself…\\nBut the greatness ends there..\\nBecause the rest of the game is bland and repetitive…\\nThe story is hard to follow,\\nthe characters are uninteresting\\nThere are no epic moments here...\\nThere are annoying one hit instakill bosses that will have you replaying the same fight over and over…\\nevery level looks and feels pretty identical...\\na lot of grey…\\nno colors here which bores me…\\njust a bunch of repeat killing the same enemies bosses and mini bosses over and over until the credits roll…\\nI had a bit of fun with vanquish...\\nBut the expectations of the internet sorta ruined this experience for me\\nI don’t know what everyone sees in this game...\\nIt’s a good game… but not beyond just good\\nI give Vanquish a 7/10An unremarkable passage, where did he have 9.2 from him, you need to fix this moment. ... Expandgame of the year.and the best shooter i have ever played.i can\\'t understand why some x-box fan boys don\\'t like it.play it if you can.it makes nothing different;but it mixes all great ideas...One of the best ARCADE ACCHORATOR SHOOTERS in recent years.Phenomenal technical realization, a charismatic protagonist and a lot of adrenaline thanks to a fast and frenetic gameplay seasoned with a myriad of furious and satisfying shootings, evolutions, humor, gigantic bosses and breathtaking films.Excellent game, with fast paced action and incredible visuals. A true homage to third person games.Too bad it is too short and there is no multiplayer.A perfect package all around.  Takes the standard third person combat that seems to be the standard these days and changes it up in unique ways.  It has amazing visuals, an over the top and absurd story involving russian space robots, and game mechanics that are simple on the surface but complex underneath.Instead of scripted events or cutscenes where all the \"cool stuff\" happens, which is common, you actually have the ability to do most of that \"cool stuff\" in the game itself if you put time and effort into mastering the controls.I have to say,this game is a HELL OF ALOT OF FUN! its been a while,since i\\'ve had just this much fun while playing a game.One that puts a smile on your face while doing so.. It all feels very cool.The graphics are very impressive,& the setup story involving.The gameplay is down to basics,flat-out,no strings attached,entertainment,while it lasts.. & thats the problem.It doesn\\'t last anywhere near as long as you\\'d want it to,& should have done.For that reason,i wouldn\\'t recommend paying full price for this,& is why it didnt get a higher mark.If they make a sequel(& i hope they do),I think we all agree,that it\\'ll need to be a significantly longer campaign.An amazing game, with exciting visuals and fast-paced game play. The AI is passable and relatively smart, the level design is well-done, and the bosses are large and intimidating, making your fight for survival even more intense. Disregarding the minor technical issues (voice-lips not syncing up), a SLIGHT issue with repetitive gun fights in between bosses, no multiplayer, and the lack of replay value, this is by far one of the best games of its type.So many complaints about the lack of multiplayer, I think the gameplay is might better and tighter for not including it and I wish more games like this would come out with a single player focus. It\\'s short, but with slick, arcade style action and a good scoring system it\\'s a lot of fun to play through more than once. One of my favorite third person shooters thanks to it\\'s fast and wild gameplay mechanics, slick design, and cornball story. It\\'s a bargain bin game now and well worth picking up.… ExpandThis has got to be one of the most underrated games of all time. This is a gem, a short gem, but none the less amazing. Unique thruster combat, and add in splosions and bullets flying everywhere, Vanquish doesn\\'t fall short and is worth playing.If you like the idea Gears of War with a Japanese flair, you\\'ll like this. Dashing and flipping about, \"bullet time,\" and plenty of various-sized enemies to blast apart. Fun, accessible achievements to boot.Frantic and addictive.The only bad thing is that it is short and has many cinematicsThis fast and fluid slam-bang shooter from Platinum Games is great fun. It\\'s a relentless action title that combines \"Gears of War \" with \"Metal Gear Rising\". The thin story plays second fiddle to the high-adrenaline, arcade-style gameplay. This game can be difficult at times, but it\\'s always a joy to play due to the smooth mechanics. With high production values and an incredible sense of speed, \"Vanquish\" comes at you like no other shooter. It\\'s an innovative must play for action freaks. I would rate it with an 8.5 out of 10.This game is fast paced and incredibly fun. But the art direction is so bland and lifeless. It never changes from the boring grey color palette. The main character and cast is extremely generic. None of the bosses were very memorable either. Except the last. The gunplay and movement are enough to make this a good way to spend 5-7 hours though. I highly recommend.Although I feel that this game doesn\\'t have very much replay value due to its \"Point A to Point B\" story based platform, I still feel a unique spot of love for this game.\\n\\nVanquish feels much more fast-paced and interesting compared to most shooters I\\'ve came across. The boss fighting also brings a series of tests and contrast between the forging ahead mindset to the focusing on defeating one target.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t mind playing through this game again, because I feel a sense of adrenaline that other shooters otherwise seem to lack.Wow what can be said about this game. If you’re looking for something with a story then this is not the game for you. The game just throws you into it with no backstory and no indication of what’s going on or why with this supposed ‘war’ you’re fighting. All I know is that you’re on some sort of space station. And for some reason the enemy uses all robots while your side uses all humans.\\n\\nIt is all about the flashy gameplay. And the gameplay is a run and gun, third-person shooter. Or put more accurately a run and slide because once you learn how to slide in your fancy suit there’s no going back. But make sure not to overheat!! Also, your suit can slow down time for more accurate shots. Now let’s talk about the boss fights, they typically had about 2-3 stages you had to get through. Oh you successfully got through the first stage and halfway through the second before some bs boss supermove takes you out cuz it’s almost impossible to dodge? Well you better get ready to play that whole fight over from the beginning, because there are no fight checkpoints between stages. The game is near impossible to play on anything but easy because of these awful boss fights, I tried getting through the very first boss fight several times before saying screw it, I’ll put it down to easy, but oh wait you have to start the whole game over again and it can only handle one save file.\\n\\nThe final ‘story’ moments has some of the biggest what the heck just happened moments, one moment everything is good and chummy and the next it’s all gone to hell and there’s no real reason why. That accurately describes the whole story. Not to mention the annoying woman who’s always talking in your ear, she’s not really involved in the war and says she can hack anything but at all the important moments she just ‘can’t get into the system’!\\n\\nOverall, avoid this game. If you must try it then rent it or borrow it from a friend because you won’t want to pick it up ever again, there is no replay value. I felt like I had played this game for a total of around 14 hours, then I checked the stats, turned out it had been about 5 hours. Phew! Oh by the way, the best gameplay rolls during the credits.This game feels like being the hidden child born from Gears of War and Bayonetta. Quick, effective, intense, and still beautiful given its age in 2020.Game of excellent quality like almost all that comes out of platinum games. Control, visual and artistic section, in general everything about this game is outstanding.Nice.Play it was really fun.More of that!Not too long, not too short.Precisely.Very Nice\\nThis game has a good fight, it has interesting capabilities and I enjoyed it\\nGreat overall and hopefully newer versions will be released']"

travel back forth unlocked checkpoints walk everything + maps/worlds beautiful varied - matter industrial desert forest area beginning world quite big 1st walkthrough say could bit + story good + lot action - sometimes 2d twin-stick shooter nice 3d graphics + cool bosses +/- 2nd walkthrough conditionally recommend 3rd walkthrough really annoying enemies 10-20 levels higher ca n't buy items beginning without health boost became annoying quit game big minus - `` tutorial '' kind introductory map really ticked goes 1h die end start ca n't save tutorial either stupidest thing tutorial shown use health items manually __ ich möchte mit einigen faqs beginnen : 1 wie kann man speichern ? - > nach dem tutorial kann man fast der ganzen welt manuell speichern sofern das gebiet sicher ist dafür müsst ihr einfach die checkpoints freischalten 2 gib es fasttravel ? - > ein fasttravel-system gibt es nach ein paar stunden gameplay ihr könnt dann zwischen den freigeschalteten checkpoints hin und herreisen vorher müsst ihr aber alles zu fuss gehen + die maps/welten sind schön und abwechslungsreich - egal ob industrie- wüsten- oder wald-gebiet zu beginn wirk die welt ziemlich gross aber nach dem 1 walkthrough muss ich sagen dass es noch etwas mehr hätte sein dürfen + die story ist gut + viel action - mal als 2d twin-stick-shooter der grösste teil hübscher 3d-grafik + coole bosse +/- der 2 walkthrough kann ich nur bedingt empfehlen es werden einige aspekte der geschichte von einer anderen seite beleuchtet und mit dem charakter 9s hat man etwas andere kampfmöglichkeiten aber unter dem strich lohnen sich die zusätzlichen und sehr ähnlichen 10h nur bedingt der 3 walkthrough ist dann richtig nervig die gegner sind 10 - 20 level höher und man kann zu beginn keine items mehr kaufen ohne health-boost wurde es annoying dass ich das spiel abgebrochen habe grosses minus - das `` tutorial '' eine art einführungsmap hat mich richtig angekackt es geht ca 1h und wenn man ende stirbt muss man alles von vorne beginnen man kann im tutorial auch nicht speichern und das dümmste ist dass im tutorial nicht gezeigt wird wie man die health-items manuell benutzt.i enjoyed hell game uniwersum

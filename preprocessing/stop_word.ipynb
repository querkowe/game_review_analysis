oynamamış biri olarak yeniden yapımı oynayıp bitirdim oyunun harika olduğunu söylemeliyim 98 yapımı sürümü oynamadığım için hikaye bölüm tasarımı konusunda yeniden yapımın orijinale ne kadar sadık kaldığını bilmiyorum ancak tek başına ele aldığım zaman bu oyunun oldukça başarılı olduğunu söyleyebilirim oyunda seçebildiğimiz iki karakter var ; leon kennedy claire redfield ben oyunu leon ile bitirdim claire ile de bitirecektim ancak hikayesinin birkaç sahne dışında neredeyse leon ile aynı olduğunu öğrendiğim için vazgeçip claire'ın hikayesinin farklı bölümlerini internetten izlemeye karar verdim oyunun hikayesi biraz kısa hikayenin büyük çoğunluğu karakolda geçiyor bundan dolayı biraz sıkılabilir bazı oyuncular ama bölüm tasarımı vuruş hissiyatı grafikleri oldukça güzel 6-7 saatlik bir oyun için ortalama hikayesi var normalde bu kadar kısa oyunlarda hikaye anlatımı hikayenin kendisi zayıf olur ancak bu oyunda ortalama bir hikaye anlatımını yakalayabilmişler oyun kısa sürdüğü için bazen hikayedeki kopukluklar aniden gelişen anlamlandıramadığımız olaylar aldığımız keyfi biraz düşürebiliyor oyunun kötü karakteri mr. x de bence iyi bir kötü karakterdi aniden duvarı yıkarak karşımıza çıkması veya bize doğru yaklaşırkenki yankılı ayak seslerini duymak güzel bir gerilim kattı oyuna oyunun kendisi çok korkutucu değil ancak mekan tasarımları sesler gerçekten de gerilimli bu gerilimi hissetmek güzel vuruş hissiyatı konusunda da oyun başarılı düşmanı vurduğumuzu hissedebiliyoruz yeterince güçlü silahlar ile vurduğumuzda düşmanın kafasını veya uzuvlarını koparabiliyoruz bu da aldığımız keyfi daha da arttırıyor oyundaki bulmacalar yer yer sıkabiliyor bazılarında takıldım uzun süre devam edemedim bazılarını da yapabilmek çok uzun sürdü aynı zamanda bir yerden sonra bulmacalar tekrar etmeye başlıyor olay daha sıkıcı bir hal alıyor grafikleri 1080p yüksek ayarlarda 2019 oyunu için güzel görünüyor ancak bazı yerlerde kaplama hataları mevcut bazı dokuların yaklaştığımda yüklenmesi gerekirken yüklenmiyor düşük çözünürlükte kalıyor bu da haliyle kötü görüntüye sebep oluyor optimizasyon konusunda genel olarak sistemimle sabit 60 fps elde edebildim ancak bazı sahnelerde fps düşüklüğü takılma sorunu oluyordu onun dışında bir problem yaşamadım resident evil 2 bana kalırsa oyuncunun oynaması gereken çok güzel bir yapım.great game somehow manages keep

excelente el viaje desde un ambiente seguros otro destila incertidumbre la generación de empatía con los protagonistas se profundiza en diálogos scripts los zombies surgen destrozados pero amenazantes la propia comisaría expone algo único la segunda entrega de la serie recibe una transformación que casi 21 años después la colocan nuevamente en el podio del gaming si fuesen películas la de 1998

un veterano de los videojuegos la vez de alguien que conocia el juego hasta hace poco gracias al nintendo switch debo admitir que al principio llamaba mucho la atención este título gracias mis amigos

exploración aventura por que decirlo survival horror ya que el mundo es hermoso tetrico la vez la historia el lore detras es muy interesante te atrapa de inmediato sus mecanicas control dificultad graficos sonido son sensillamente magnificos ostenta una calidad un derroche de talento por parte de team cherry excepcional muy recomendable para quienes les gustan los retos de manera subjetiva es uno de los videojuegos mas hermosos e interesantes que jugado con un lore muy inquietante la vez de fasinante yo le daria un 10 pero sere justo aqui biene la parte objetiva tiene muy pocos defectos como el hecho de que llega tener ciertos bugs como en la degunda batalla contra hornet donde si aplicas el ataque en espiral tecnica del aguijón contra ella el juego se cerrara diciendo que un fallo inesperado ocurrio fuera de ese detalle todo es soberbio hermoso felicidades team cherry por esta joya.simple 2d action platformer nice style metroidvania vibe resisted make favor buy it.hollow knight

exploring everywhere possibly add various areas extremely well made beautiful epic visuals one best made maps dark souls series upgrading system also updated well always beneficial infuse weapons along fact many new infusions added game like heavy sharp refined deep also longer hard find titanite upgrade weapons like games series often farm enemies almost every single kind titanite game collect enough ng fully upgrade eight weapons ..... time tell game huge let seems literally none issues plagued game series ever since inception fixed camera angles bad worse dark souls 1 especially get kind small room fight big boss monster often find see single damn thing camera stuck wall pillar also fixed issue hitboxes game often find hit attacks obviously even close actual character especially prevalent pvp issue compounded another huge issue series pvp lag often find attacks simply hit players suddenly teleport couple feet every seconds suddenly backstabbed person literally seemed teleport behind mix absolutely atrocious hitboxes game asking extreme amounts rage talking pvp seriously want ask software ever heard word 'unbalanced game 's pvp system probably broken seen entire series souls games weapons build sets get game make able easily 1 hit kill/1 inescapable combo kill literally anyone whereas weapons like pea shooters comparison add multiple weapons vastly better moveset weapons point completely unfair ds3 pvp good example would farron greatsword dagger combo weapon versus dark sword dark sword small sword therefore able hit much faster greatsword dagger combo correct ? nope game greatsword multiple attacks light years faster dark sword well large sweeping attacks take away entire stamina bar blocking top greatsword dagger combo weapon also multiple moves give unassailable poise even wearing light armor greatly disappointed game fact game breaking issues still made game even generally accepted community personally think absolutely ridiculous big game developer like software would release game many glitches huge issues apparent since first game assure never fix issues patch rest assured knowing score game wo n't change genuinely enjoy game think great finale series however get huge glaring issues.dark souls 3 fitting end series many throwbacks superb gameplay systems gameplay combat mechanics would expect souls game slightly refined addition weapon arts fun new wrinkle adds depth weapons exploration one highlights game ds3 exception peaking around corner find rare piece equipment perhaps titanite source always reviling moment perhaps fighting tough enemies reach drop benefits greatly sense scope also back paths connect able look upon path traveled hours satisfying story lore always obtuse cryptic however chose look listen game hard grasp poke nose engrossed become world also souls veterans many callbacks original ds make fan happy surprised presentation graphics nice wont blow away different locales variety

choices unlike game pretty much game tells works something like uncharted game walking dead set bar zombie theme game even coming close gameplay even worse horrible gun play terrible unreliable

bulletproof vests helmets take 4 shotgun body shots kill one soldier 4-5 meters away make ridiculous max ammo shotgun like 16 rounds overall 's bad game n't nowhere goty think 10/10 reviewers n't play whole game half way game already tired collecting items playing hide seek bandits stages clearly designed combat scattered objects use cover placed obviously upon seeing know enemies around hoping another experience like `` walking dead '' unfortunately disappointed positive : + good script game setting + awesome rare cut scenes + environments + animations voice acting + ellie character negative : - graphics - linear predictable story - lack interactivity characters - dumb ai - game mechanicsi usually sit read reviews felt compelled give short accurate review six hours game must say

travel back forth unlocked checkpoints walk everything + maps/worlds beautiful varied - matter industrial desert forest area beginning world quite big 1st walkthrough say could bit + story good + lot action - sometimes 2d twin-stick shooter nice 3d graphics + cool bosses +/- 2nd walkthrough conditionally recommend 3rd walkthrough really annoying enemies 10-20 levels higher ca n't buy items beginning without health boost became annoying quit game big minus - `` tutorial '' kind introductory map really ticked goes 1h die end start ca n't save tutorial either stupidest thing tutorial shown use health items manually __ ich möchte mit einigen faqs beginnen : 1 wie kann man speichern ? - > nach dem tutorial kann man fast der ganzen welt manuell speichern sofern das gebiet sicher ist dafür müsst ihr einfach die checkpoints freischalten 2 gib es fasttravel ? - > ein fasttravel-system gibt es nach ein paar stunden gameplay ihr könnt dann zwischen den freigeschalteten checkpoints hin und herreisen vorher müsst ihr aber alles zu fuss gehen + die maps/welten sind schön und abwechslungsreich - egal ob industrie- wüsten- oder wald-gebiet zu beginn wirk die welt ziemlich gross aber nach dem 1 walkthrough muss ich sagen dass es noch etwas mehr hätte sein dürfen + die story ist gut + viel action - mal als 2d twin-stick-shooter der grösste teil hübscher 3d-grafik + coole bosse +/- der 2 walkthrough kann ich nur bedingt empfehlen es werden einige aspekte der geschichte von einer anderen seite beleuchtet und mit dem charakter 9s hat man etwas andere kampfmöglichkeiten aber unter dem strich lohnen sich die zusätzlichen und sehr ähnlichen 10h nur bedingt der 3 walkthrough ist dann richtig nervig die gegner sind 10 - 20 level höher und man kann zu beginn keine items mehr kaufen ohne health-boost wurde es annoying dass ich das spiel abgebrochen habe grosses minus - das `` tutorial '' eine art einführungsmap hat mich richtig angekackt es geht ca 1h und wenn man ende stirbt muss man alles von vorne beginnen man kann im tutorial auch nicht speichern und das dümmste ist dass im tutorial nicht gezeigt wird wie man die health-items manuell benutzt.i enjoyed hell game uniwersum

10/10 hands best souls game ever.el juego sigue la misma formula que lo hizo grande buena historia difícil desde el primer minuto grandes novedades buen sistema de armas variedad de armas armaduras .un buen reto para los veteranos como para principiantes.estupendo juego digno representante de la saga souls aun que tan dificil como sus antesesores pero tiene mejoras en el combate estupendas mecánicas de juego con una banda sonora muy buena unos enemigos excelentemente diseñados.from software nos vuelve dejar una obra maestra uno de esos juegos que hay en la industria actual uno de esos juegos que agradeces por poder disfrutar presenciar en una época tan complicada de los videojuegos como la actual si eres un veterano de la saga ya sabes lo que te enfrentas al menos tienes una idea si eres nuevo déjame decirte que estas ante tu videojuego más frustrante la vez más satisfactorio de tu vida gamer ¿qué es dark souls 3 ? más que un juego es una experiencia un juego que te enseña la valiosa lección de que perder y/o fallar es malo al contrario para enfrentar ese reto de nuevo lograr vencerlo esa es la alma principal de dark souls este es un juego único donde los demás son pura cinemática mecánicas dificultad de risa este juego nos deja libres en un mundo donde tu tienes que descubrir la historia interpretarla tu manera ritmo donde nada te ayuda saber que tienes que hacer continuación un juego donde la satisfacción de lograr vencer ese jefe que estuvo fastidiándote por horas por días es la mayor recompensa de este juego durante mis más de 50 horas que dedique la primera vez que jugué este juego puedo estar más satisfecho con mi compra con el tiempo que invertí en este aun así pesar de que investigue todo lo que pude sin guía ni nada por el estilo deje más de la mitad de lo que el juego ofrece en ítems secretos demás si lo que el equipo de software dice sea cierto que este es el ultimo juego de la saga souls es una despedida como se merece tomando todo lo bueno mejorando lo ya bueno reduciendo los fallos que aun así hay algunos pero son ni lo suficiente para que se noten en este juego ¿cómo ser justo con los jugadores nuevos los veteranos ? el juego tiene una dificultad justa para los novatos que sea difícil más imposible de total desafío para nosotros los experimentados curtidos en esta saga al igual que un silent hill donde el pueblo es el personaje principal los escenarios en dark souls 3 son bellísimos con un diseño de arte único enormes lugares miles de cosas por descubrir fueron muchas veces en las que detuve presenciar un paisaje este souls es una carta de amor los veteranos ya que hay muchas referencias con el primer juego en varias veces sentí como en casa pero la vez descubriendo cosas nuevas cometas el error de desperdiciar tu experiencia usando una guía solo si de verdad sabes que sigue haz uso de una pero un juego así merece tu total atención te sentirás decepcionado pesar de la frustración enojo que significa morir una otra vez terminar un dark souls es una experiencia satisfacción enorme aunque hayas visto recogido todo del juego siempre tienes ganas de seguir jugándolo por que juegos así ya hacen esto más que una review es una platica sobre mi experiencia desde que se anuncio el juego la espera era interminable solo valió la pena supero completamente mis expectativas ¿debes comprar dark souls 3 ? definitivamente si eres veterano de la saga por nada del mundo te pierdas esta obra maestra esta conclusión como se merece una saga que difícilmente volvamos ver que pasara tiempo para ver un juego de su calibre si eres nuevo también te sentirás perdido pues la historia es enorme maravillosa hay muchas cosas del primer juego que están aquí sin duda deberás jugar el primero para mejorar tu experiencia pero de que lo disfrutaras eso sin duda dark souls 3 es el mejor juegos de la saga el mejor juego de las next gen actualmente atrevo decir que estamos ante el juego del año uno de los mejores de la historia de los videojuegos 10/10espere tanto de éste juego lo ansié con tantas ganas esperaba tanto de él .. al final obtuve mas de lo que esperaba el juego tanto como su historia como su fanservice que si bien en muchas ocaciones destruye un juego en éste caso supieron juntar el fanservice con la historia quedó una obra de arte puede que quizás su nivel de dificultad sea como el de el primer darksoul pero significa que el juego sea difícil lo disfruté de principio fin es uno de los pocos juegos que van quedar en mi memoria una obra de arte que hoy en día se muy poco.as much ca

e tem os feelings de darkão praise sun e jogue ds3 simplesmente melhor da franquia em tudo.es el segundo dark souls que termino ds ii frustró mucho aunque lo dejé muy avanzado lo llegué terminar sin duda creo que es el más pulido mejor llevado de la trilogía llevando eso por delante puedo si aplaudirlo por depurar un concepto de juego tan extraño la vez atrayente todo lo que tiene que ver con la idea del juego en sí es una virtud la narrativa segmentada el miedo la muerte como principal amenaza al jugador la curiosidad descubrimiento la experimentacion con las clases el equipo los jefes ... etc todo lo que hace un dark souls un dark souls está perfectamente pulido sin embargo si que le veo fallos al concepto algunos de ellos menores que permiten darle el 10 primero sigo pensando que hay momentos de este juego donde puedes sobrevivir sin haber muerto antes varias veces aunque en general el juego es mas exigente que difícil aún hay ciertas amenazas que puedes afrontar más por verlas venir que otra cosa son tantas pero están ahí hay gente que esto le gusta pero es mi caso por otro lado agrada que pierdas gran parte de la experiencia del juego si pagas el gold es que sea completamente necesario puedes matar por ti mismo los jefes si tienes la habilidad pero es poner una barrera extra para disfrutar de todo lo que ofrece el juego el rendimiento técnico en sí tampoco es estelar pero hubieron momentos en que incomodara mas allá algunos bugs que sufrieron los enemigos creo que esta es la entrega mas recomendable de la saga mantiene los elementos que hicieron grande la primera entrega agrega otros que sirven para depurarla es un gran juego que recomiendo cualquiera que pueda con la frustración de ciertos segmentos donde sinceramente dan ganas de romper el mando.dark souls iii excellent addition souls series easily spend 100 hours one play thoroughly exploring game visuals musical score game phenomenal although runs 30 fps 9/10 rather 10/10 still feels smooth

la escucho se pone la piel de gallina una gran aventura que todo amante de los videojuegos debería jugar como en cada mario en 3d se añaden nuevas mecánicas se perfeccionan si es posible las antiguas este juego puede presumir de un control excelente sin lugar dudas en este juego mario se va al espacio rescatar la princesa visitando mundos preciosos con planetas de distintos tamaños que en algunos casos para visitarlos tienes que jugar con la gravedad muy bien implementada sin duda se podría decir que es uno de los mejores juegos de la historia.i think mario game 've seen way completion smartly

una sensación natural comoda aparte de todo esto la relacion inovación dificultad diseño de nivel es increible si es lo mejor que existe en juego de plataformas entonces es de los mejores en mi

pintura cada frame pincel celestial faz dar vida ao jogo onde você pode pincelar um circulo na água e daí aparece uma vitória régia pintando um risco você tanto pode fatiar os inimigos ao meio como pode sair de uma cela desenhar uma meia lua céu faz dia virar noite ou um círculo faz noite virar dia e isso é opus magnum da clover stúdios grande ideia de jogabilidade que até shigueru miyamoto queria inventar os sons excelentes músicas são perfeitas dois personagens com carisma impar vulgo issun e suzano junto com nossa divindade amaterasu que você se apega de um jeito tão apaixonante e tudo contando um pouco folclore japonês fazendo você querer explorar tudo que jogo tem e de sobra para lhe oferecer não quero desmerecer nintendo pois ocarina time é melhor jogo de todos os tempos mas okami é jogo que zelda dessa geração game cube e wii não foi pois é muito fácil fazer um jogo excelente em cima de conceitos novos como twilight princess é com seu wii motion mas fazer conceitos de jogabilidade único original inovador e em cima de um controle velho como dual shock ou nesses quase 10 anos da criação direcional analógico é como reinventar algo para substituir rodas de um carro muito mais difícil não é ? e é nesse ponto que eu tiro meu chapéu para atsushi okami inaba seu jogo é uma obra de arte e com muito louvor é merecedor de ser um clássico eterno alex 29/06/2009.…
